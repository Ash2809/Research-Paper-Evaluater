      "1\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved great success in numerous game genres including\n",
      "board games, Atari games, simple first-person-shooter (FPS) games, real-time strategy (RTS) games,\n",
      "and multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games. Recently, open-world games have garnered\n",
      "attention due to their playing mechanisms and their resemblance to real-world control tasks. Minecraft,\n",
      "as a typical open-world game, has been increasingly explored in recent years.\n",
      "Compared to other games, the properties of Minecraft make it an ideal testbed for RL research,\n",
      "because it emphasizes exploration, perception, and construction in a 3D open world. Agents are given\n",
      "partial observability and face occlusions. Tasks in the game are chained and long-term. Humans can\n",
      "typically make rational decisions to explore basic items and construct more complex items with a\n",
      "reasonable amount of practice, while it can be challenging for AI agents to do so autonomously. To\n",
      "facilitate the effective decision-making of agents in playing Minecraft, MineRL has been developed\n",
      "as a research competition platform, which provides human demonstrations and encourages the\n",
      "development of sample-efficient RL agents for playing Minecraft. Since its release, many efforts\n",
      "have been made to develop Minecraft AI agents.\n",
      "However, it remains difficult for current RL algorithms to acquire items in Minecraft due to several\n",
      "factors, which include the following. First, in order to reach goals, the agent is required to complete\n",
      "many sub-tasks that highly depend on each other. Due to the sparse reward, it is difficult for agents\n",
      "to learn long-horizon decisions efficiently. Hierarchical RL from demonstrations has been explored\n",
      "to take advantage of the task structure to accelerate learning. However, learning from unstructured\n",
      "demonstrations without any domain knowledge remains difficult. Second, Minecraft is a flexible\n",
      "3D first-person game which revolves around gathering resources and creating structures and items.\n",
      "In this environment, agents are required to handle high-dimensional visual input to enable efficient\n",
      ".\n",
      "control. However, the agentâ€™s surroundings are varied and dynamic, which makes it difficult to learn\n",
      "a good representation. Third, with partial observability, the agent needs to explore in the right way\n",
      "and collect information from the environment in order to achieve goals. Naive exploration can waste\n",
      "a lot of samples on useless actions. Self-imitation learning (SIL) is a simple method that learns to\n",
      "reproduce past good behaviors to incentivize exploration, but it is not sample efficient. Lastly, human\n",
      "demonstrations are diverse and often noisy.\n",
      "To address these combined challenges, we propose an efficient hierarchical RL approach, equipped\n",
      "with novel representation and imitation learning techniques. Our method leverages human demonstra-\n",

      "3.1\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "Our overall framework is shown in Figure 1. We define human demonstrations as D = {Ï„0, Ï„1, Ï„2, ...}\n",

      "We define an atomic skill as a skill that gets a non-zero reward. We define sub-tasks and sub-goals\n",

      "keeping those with long reward delays as individual sub-tasks and merging those with short reward\n",
      "delays into one sub-task. Through this process, we have n sub-tasks in total. To define sub-goals for\n",
      "each sub-task, we extract the most common human behavior pattern and use the last state in each\n",
      "sub-task as its sub-goal. Through this, we have structured demonstrations (D â†’{D0, D1, ..., Dnâˆ’1}\n",
      ") with sub-tasks and sub-goals used to train the hierarchical agent. With the structured demonstrations,\n",
      "we train the meta-policy using imitation learning and train sub-policies to solve sub-tasks using\n",

      "Meta- and Sub-policies\n",
      "Meta-policy. We train a meta-policy that maps continuous states to discrete indices (0, 1, ..., n - 1)\n",
      "that specify which option to use. Given state space S and discrete option o âˆˆO, the meta-policy is\n",
      "defined as Ï€m(Î¸)(o|s), where s âˆˆS, o âˆˆO, and Î¸ represents the parameters. Ï€m(Î¸)(o|s) specifies\n",
      "the conditional distribution over the discrete options. To train the meta-policy, we generate training\n",
      "data (s, i) where i represents the i-th stage and s âˆˆDi is sampled from the demonstrations of the i-th\n",

      "Consistency Filtering. Human demonstrations can be diverse and noisy. Directly imitating such noisy\n",
