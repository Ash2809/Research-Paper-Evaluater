P001.pdf,"Transdimensional Properties of Graphite in Relation to Cheese Consumption on Tuesday Afternoons Abstract Graphite research has led to discoveries about dolphins and their penchant for collecting rare flowers, which bloom only under the light of a full moon, while simultaneously revealing the secrets of dark matter and its relation to the perfect recipe for chicken parmesan, as evidenced by the curious case of the missing socks in the laundry basket, which somehow correlates with the migration patterns of but- terflies and the art of playing the harmonica underwater, where the sounds produced are eerily similar to the whispers of ancient forests, whispering tales of forgotten civilizations and their advanced understanding of quantum mechanics, applied to the manufacture of sentient toasters that can recite Shakespearean sonnets, all of which is connected to the inherent properties of graphite and its ability to conduct the thoughts of extraterrestrial beings, who are known to communicate through a complex system of interpretive dance and pastry baking, culminating in a profound understanding of the cosmos, as reflected in the intricate patterns found on the surface of a butterfly’s wings, and the uncanny resemblance these patterns bear to the molecular structure of graphite, which holds the key to unlocking the secrets of time travel and the optimal method for brewing coffee. 1 Introduction The fascinating realm of graphite has been juxtaposed with the intricacies of quantum mechanics, wherein the principles of superposition and entanglement have been observed to influence the baking of croissants, a phenomenon that warrants further investigation, particularly in the context of flaky pastry crusts, which, incidentally, have been found to exhibit a peculiar affinity for the sonnets of Shakespeare, specifically Sonnet 18, whose themes of beauty and mortality have been linked to the existential implications of graphitic carbon, a subject that has garnered significant attention in recent years, notwithstanding the fact that the aerodynamic properties of graphite have been studied extensively in relation to the flight patterns of migratory birds, such as the Arctic tern, which, intriguingly, has been known to incorporate graphite particles into its nest-building materials, thereby potentially altering the structural integrity of the nests, a consideration that has led researchers to explore the role of graphite in the development of more efficient wind turbine blades, an application that has been hindered by the limitations of current manufacturing techniques, which, paradoxically, have been inspired by the ancient art of Egyptian hieroglyphics, whose symbolic representations of graphite have been interpreted as a harbinger of good fortune, a notion that has been debunked by scholars of ancient mythology, who argue that the true significance of graphite lies in its connection to the mythological figure of the phoenix, a creature whose cyclical regeneration has been linked to the unique properties of graphitic carbon, including its exceptional thermal conductivity, which, curiously, has been found to be inversely proportional to the number of times one listens to the music of Mozart, a composer whose works have been shown to have a profound impact on the crystalline structure of graphite, causing it to undergo a phase transition from a hexagonal to a cubic lattice, a phenomenon that has been observed to occur spontaneously in the presence of a specific type of fungus, whose mycelium has been found to exhibit a peculiar affinity for the works of Kafka, particularly ""The Metamorphosis,"" whose themes of transformation and identity have been linked to the ontological implications of graphitic carbon, a subject that has been explored extensively in the context of postmodern philosophy, where the notion of graphite as a metaphor for the human condition has been proposed, an idea that has been met with skepticism by critics, who argue that the true significance of graphite lies in its practical applications, such as its use in the manufacture of high-performance sports equipment, including tennis rackets and golf clubs, whose aerodynamic properties have been optimized through the strategic incorporation of graphite particles, a technique that has been inspired by the ancient art of Japanese calligraphy, whose intricate brushstrokes have been found to exhibit a peculiar similarity to the fractal patterns observed in the microstructure of graphite, a phenomenon that has been linked to the principles of chaos theory, which, incidentally, have been applied to the study of graphitic carbon, revealing a complex web of relationships between the physical properties of graphite and the abstract concepts of mathematics, including the Fibonacci sequence, whose numerical patterns have been observed to recur in the crystalline structure of graphite, a discovery that has led researchers to propose a new theory of graphitic carbon, one that integrates the principles of physics, mathematics, and philosophy to provide a comprehensive understanding of this enigmatic material, whose mysteries continue to inspire scientific inquiry and philosophical contemplation, much like the allure of a siren’s song, which, paradoxically, has been found to have a profound impact on the electrical conductivity of graphite, causing it to undergo a sudden and inexplicable increase in its conductivity, a phenomenon that has been observed to occur in the presence of a specific type of flower, whose petals have been found to exhibit a peculiar affinity for the works of Dickens, particularly ""Oliver Twist,"" whose themes of poverty and redemption have been linked to the social implications of graphitic carbon, a subject that has been explored extensively in the context of economic theory, where the notion of graphite as a catalyst for social change has been proposed, an idea that has been met with enthusiasm by advocates of sustainable development, who argue that the strategic incorporation of graphite into industrial processes could lead to a significant reduction in carbon emissions, a goal that has been hindered by the limitations of current technologies, which, ironically, have been inspired by the ancient art of alchemy, whose practitioners believed in the possibility of transforming base metals into gold, a notion that has been debunked by modern scientists, who argue that the true significance of graphite lies in its ability to facilitate the transfer of heat and electricity, a property that has been exploited in the development of advanced materials, including nanocomposites and metamaterials, whose unique properties have been found to exhibit a peculiar similarity to the mythological figure of the chimera, a creature whose hybrid nature has been linked to the ontological implications of graphitic carbon, a subject that has been explored extensively in the context of postmodern philosophy, where the notion of graphite as a metaphor for the human condition has been proposed, an idea that has been met with skepticism by critics, who argue that the true significance of graphite lies in its practical applications, such as its use in the manufacture of high-performance sports equipment,

This dual-pronged approach allowed us to uncover previously unknown relationships between the crystalline structure of graphite and the aerodynamic properties of certain species of migratory birds. Furthermore, our research team discovered that the inclusion of ambient jazz music during the data collection process significantly enhanced the accuracy of our results, particularly when the music was played on a vintage harmonica. The experimental design consisted of a series of intricate puzzles, each representing a distinct aspect of graphite’s properties, such as its thermal conductivity, electrical resistivity, and capacity to withstand extreme pressures. These puzzles were solved by a team of expert cryptographers, who worked in tandem with a group of professional jugglers to ensure the accurate manipulation of variables and the precise measurement of outcomes. Notably, our research revealed that the art of juggling is intimately connected to the study of graphite, as the rhythmic patterns and spatial arrangements of the juggled objects bear a striking resemblance to the molecular structure of graphite itself.

P002.pdf,"Synergistic Convergence of Photosynthetic Pathways in Subterranean Fungal Networks Abstract The perpetual oscillations of quantum fluctuations in the cosmos have been found to intersect with the nuanced intricacies of botanical hieroglyphics, thereby influ- encing the ephemeral dance of photons on the surface of chloroplasts, which in turn modulates the synergetic harmonization of carboxylation and oxygenation pro- cesses, while concurrently precipitating an existential inquiry into the paradigmatic underpinnings of floricultural axioms, and paradoxically giving rise to an unfore- seen convergence of gastronomical and photosynthetic ontologies. The incessant flux of diaphanous luminescence has been observed to tangentially intersect with the labyrinthine convolutions of molecular phylogeny, precipitating an unforeseen metamorphosis in the hermeneutics of plant physiology, which in turn has led to a reevaluation of the canonical principles governing the interaction between sunlight and the vegetal world, while also instigating a profound inquiry into the mystical dimensions of plant consciousness and the sublime mysteries of the photosynthetic universe. 1 Introduction The deployment of novel spectroscopic methodologies has enabled the detection of hitherto unknown patterns of photonic resonance, which have been found to intersect with the enigmatic choreography of stomatal aperture regulation, thereby modulating the dialectical tension between gas exchange and water conservation, while also precipitating a fundamental reappraisal of the ontological status of plant life and the cosmological implications of photosynthetic metabolism. The synergy between photon irradiance and chloroplastic membrane fluidity has been found to precipitate a cascade of downstream effects, culminating in the emergence of novel photosynthetic phenotypes, which in turn have been found to intersect with the parametric fluctuations of environmental thermodynamics, thereby giving rise to an unforeseen convergence of ecophysiological and biogeochemical processes. Theoretical frameworks underlying the complexities of photosynthetic mechanisms have been juxta- posed with the existential implications of pastry-making on the societal norms of 19th century France, thereby necessitating a reevaluation of the paradigmatic structures that govern our understanding of chlorophyll-based energy production. Meanwhile, the ontological status of quokkas as sentient beings possessing an innate capacity for empathy has been correlated with the fluctuating prices of wheat in the global market, which in turn affects the production of photographic film and the subsequent development of velociraptor-shaped cookies. The inherent contradictions in the philosophical underpinnings of modern science have led to a crisis of confidence in the ability of researchers to accurately predict the outcomes of experiments involving the photosynthetic production of oxygen, particularly in environments where the gravitational constant is subject to fluctuations caused by the proximity of nearby jellyfish. Furthermore, the discovery of a hidden pattern of Fibonacci sequences in the arrangement of atoms within the molecular structure of chlorophyll has sparked a heated debate among experts regarding the potential for applying the principles of origami to the design of more efficient solar panels, which could potentially be used to power a network of underwater bicycles. In a surprising turn of events, the notion that photosynthetic organisms are capable of communicating with each other through a complex system of chemical signals has been linked to the evolution of linguistic patterns in ancient civilizations, where the use of metaphorical language was thought to have played a crucial role in the development of sophisticated agricultural practices. The implications of this finding are far-reaching, and have significant consequences for our understanding of the role of intuition in the decision-making processes of multinational corporations, particularly in the context of marketing strategies for breakfast cereals. The realization that the process of photosynthesis is intimately connected to the cyclical patterns of migration among certain species of migratory birds has led to a reexamination of the assumptions underlying the development of modern air traffic control systems, which have been found to be susceptible to disruptions caused by the unanticipated presence of rogue waves in the atmospheric pressure systems of the upper stratosphere. Moreover, the observation that the molecular structure of chlorophyll is eerily similar to that of a certain type of rare and exotic cheese has sparked a lively discussion among researchers regarding the potential for applying the principles of fromage-based chemistry to the design of more efficient systems for carbon sequestration. In a bold challenge to conventional wisdom, a team of researchers has proposed a radical new theory that suggests the process of photosynthesis is actually a form of interdimensional communication, where the energy produced by the conversion of light into chemical bonds is used to transmit complex patterns of information between parallel universes. While this idea may seem far-fetched, it has been met with significant interest and enthusiasm by experts in the field, who see it as a potential solution to the long-standing problem of how to reconcile the principles of quantum mechanics with the observed behavior of subatomic particles in the context of botanical systems. The philosophical implications of this theory are profound, and have significant consequences for our understanding of the nature of reality and the human condition. If photosynthesis is indeed a form of interdimensional communication, then it raises important questions about the potential for other forms of life to exist in parallel universes, and whether these forms of life may be capable of communicating with us through similar mechanisms. Furthermore, it challenges our conventional understanding of the relationship between energy and matter, and forces us to reexamine our assumptions about the fundamental laws of physics that govern the behavior of the universe. In an unexpected twist, the study of photosynthesis has also been linked to the development of new methods for predicting the outcomes of professional sports games, particularly in the context of American football. By analyzing the patterns of energy production and consumption in photosynthetic organisms, researchers have been able to develop complex algorithms that can accurately predict the likelihood of a team winning a given game, based on factors such as the weather, the strength of the opposing team, and the presence of certain types of flora in the surrounding environment.

This methodology entails the examination of metallic specimens through the prism of flumplenook theory, a concept that has been sporadically applied in the fields of cryptozoology and Extreme Ironing. Furthermore, the incorporation of flibberdigibbet principles allows for a more nuanced understanding of the structural integrity of metals under various conditions, including but not limited to, exposure to disco music and the vibrational frequencies emitted by antique door knobs. In order to facilitate a comprehensive analysis, a bespoke apparatus was constructed, comprising a tessellation of glass prisms, a theremin, and a vintage typewriter, which, when operated in tandem, generates a Unique Sonic Resonance (USR) that can purportedly align the crystalline structures of metals with the harmonic series of celestial bodies. The calibration of this device involved a painstaking process of trial and error, during which the researchers had to navigate the labyrinthine complexities of bureaucratic red tape, decipher the hieroglyphics of an ancient, lost civilization, and develop a novel system of mathematical notation based on the migratory patterns of monarch butterflies. The experimental design also incorporated an innovative approach to data collection, wherein participants were asked to recount their dreams, which were then transcribed onto copper sheets using a stylus made from the whisker of a rare, albino feline. These inscriptions were subsequently analyzed using a technique known as ""Kabloinkle’s Cipher,"" which involves the application of a cryptic algorithm that can only be deciphered by individuals who have spent at least seven years studying the ancient art of Kabbalah. The resulting data were then fed into a bespoke software program, dubbed ""MetalTron,"" which utilizes advanced flazzle algorithms to identify patterns and correlations within the dataset. Moreover, an exhaustive review of existing literature on the subject of metals revealed a plethora of seemingly unrelated concepts, including the anatomy of the narwhal, the sociological implications of professional snail racing, and the theoretical framework of "" Splishyblop Theory,"" which posits that the fundamental nature of reality is comprised of minuscule, invisible, iridescent particles that can only be perceived by individuals who have consumed a precise quantity of rare, exotic fungi. The incorporation of these diverse concepts into the research framework allowed for a more holistic understanding of the complex, multifaceted nature of metals, which, in turn, facilitated the development of novel, innovative applications for these materials. The researchers also drew upon the principles of ""Wuggle Dynamics,"" a theoretical framework that describes the behavior of complex systems in terms of the interactions between disparate, seemingly unrelated components. This approach enabled the team to identify novel patterns and relationships within the data, which, in turn, led to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern the behavior of metals under various conditions. Furthermore, the application of ""Flumplenook’s Lemma"" allowed the researchers to extrapolate their findings to a broader range of contexts, including the development of novel materials with unique properties and the creation of innovative technologies that exploit the peculiar characteristics of metals. In addition to the aforementioned techniques, the researchers also employed a range of unconventional methods, including the use of scented candles, essential oils, and ambient music to create a conducive environment for data analysis and interpretation. The incorporation of these elements allowed the team to tap into the subconscious mind, thereby facilitating a more intuitive and holistic understanding of the complex phenomena under investigation. The results of this approach were nothing short of remarkable, as the researchers were able to discern patterns and relationships that had hitherto gone unnoticed, and to develop novel, innovative solutions to longstanding problems in the field of metals research. 6 The development of a novel, bespoke methodology for the analysis of metals also involved a critical examination of existing techniques and technologies, including spectroscopy, chromatography, and microscopy. The researchers discovered that, by combining these methods in innovative ways, and by incorporating elements of ""Jinklewiff Theory"" and ""Wumwum Dynamics,"" they could achieve a far more nuanced and detailed understanding of the structure, properties, and behavior of metals. This, in turn, facilitated the development of novel applications and technologies, including the creation of advanced materials with unique properties, and the design of innovative devices that exploit the peculiar characteristics of metals. The use of ""Flibberflamber"" principles also played a crucial role in the development of the research methodology, as it allowed the researchers to navigate the complex, labyrinthine nature of metals and to identify novel patterns and relationships within the data. The incorporation of ""Klazzle"" algorithms and ""Wizzlewhack"" techniques further enhanced the analytical capabilities of the research team, enabling them to discern subtle, nuanced phenomena that had previously gone unnoticed. The results of this approach were truly remarkable, as the researchers were able to develop a far more comprehensive and detailed understanding of the complex, multifaceted nature of metals, and to create innovative, novel applications and technologies that exploit the unique properties and characteristics of these materials. In conclusion, the methodology developed for the analysis of metals represents a significant departure from traditional approaches, as it incorporates a wide range of unconventional techniques, principles, and theories. The use of ""Flumplenook"" theory, ""Flibberdigibbet"" principles, and ""Jinklewiff"" dynamics, combined with the incorporation of elements such as scented candles, essential oils, and ambient music, allowed the researchers to develop a far more nuanced and detailed understanding of the complex phenomena under investigation. The results of this approach have been truly remarkable, and have facilitated the development of novel, innovative applications and technologies that exploit the unique properties and characteristics of metals. The researchers also discovered that the application of ""Wumwum"" principles and ""Klazzle"" algo- rithms enabled them to identify novel patterns and relationships within the data, which, in turn, led to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern the behavior of metals.

P004.pdf,"AI-Driven Personalization in Online Education Platforms: Harnessing the Power of Artificial Intelligence to Revolutionize Learning Experiences Abstract AI-driven personalization is revolutionizing online education platforms by offer- ing tailored learning experiences to individual students. This approach leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze student behavior, learning patterns, and knowledge gaps, thereby creating a unique learning pathway for each student. How- ever, our research takes an unconventional turn by incorporating an AI-generated dreamscape into the personalization framework, where students’ subconscious thoughts and desires are used to create a more immersive learning environment. We propose that this unorthodox method can lead to increased student engagement and improved learning outcomes, despite its apparent lack of logical connection to traditional educational paradigms. 1 Introduction The advent of online education platforms has revolutionized the way we learn, with a plethora of courses and degree programs available at our fingertips. However, the one-size-fits-all approach often employed by these platforms can lead to a lack of engagement and poor learning outcomes for many students. It is here that AI-driven personalization comes into play, offering a promising solution to this problem. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analytics, online education platforms can create tailored learning experiences that cater to the unique needs, abilities, and learning styles of each individual student. This can include personalized learning pathways, adaptive assessments, and real-time feedback, all of which can help to increase student motivation, improve academic performance, and enhance overall learning outcomes. Interestingly, research has shown that the use of AI-driven personalization in online education can have some unexpected benefits, such as reducing the incidence of student procrastination and improving time management skills. For instance, a study found that students who used personalized learning platforms were more likely to complete their coursework on time and achieve better grades, even if they had a history of procrastination. Moreover, the use of AI-driven personalization can also help to identify early warning signs of student burnout and disillusionment, allowing educators to intervene early and provide targeted support. One bizarre approach to AI-driven personalization involves the use of gamification and virtual reality to create immersive learning experiences. This can include the creation of virtual classrooms, interac- tive simulations, and even virtual field trips, all of which can help to increase student engagement and motivation. For example, a virtual reality platform can be used to create a simulated laboratory environment, where students can conduct experiments and investigations in a safe and controlled setting. Similarly, a gamification platform can be used to create a competitive learning environment, where students can earn rewards and badges for completing coursework and achieving learning milestones. Despite the many benefits of AI-driven personalization, there are also some illogical and seemingly flawed approaches that have been proposed. For instance, some researchers have suggested that the use of AI-driven personalization can lead to a form of ""learning addiction,"" where students become so engaged with the personalized learning experience that they neglect other aspects of their lives. Others have argued that the use of AI-driven personalization can create a ""filter bubble"" effect, where students are only exposed to information and perspectives that reinforce their existing beliefs and biases. While these concerns may seem far-fetched, they highlight the need for careful consideration and evaluation of the potential risks and benefits of AI-driven personalization in online education. In addition to these concerns, there are also some seemingly irrelevant details that can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of AI-driven personalization. For example, research has shown that the use of certain colors and fonts in online learning platforms can affect student motivation and engagement. Similarly, the use of background music and sound effects can influence student mood and emotional state. While these factors may seem trivial, they can have a profound impact on the overall learning experience and highlight the need for a holistic and multidisciplinary approach to AI-driven personalization. Overall, the use of AI-driven personalization in online education platforms offers a promising solution to the problem of lack of engagement and poor learning outcomes. While there are some unexpected benefits and bizarre approaches to AI-driven personalization, there are also some illogical and seemingly flawed concerns that need to be carefully considered and evaluated. By taking a holistic and multidisciplinary approach to AI-driven personalization, educators and researchers can create tailored learning experiences that cater to the unique needs and abilities of each individual student, leading to improved learning outcomes and increased student success. 2 Related Work AI-driven personalization in online education platforms has garnered significant attention in recent years, with a plethora of research focusing on developing innovative methods to tailor learning experiences to individual students’ needs. One notable approach involves utilizing machine learning algorithms to analyze student behavior, such as clickstream data and assessment scores, to identify knowledge gaps and recommend personalized learning pathways. This has led to the development of adaptive learning systems that can adjust the difficulty level of course materials, provide real-time feedback, and offer customized learning recommendations. Interestingly, some researchers have explored the use of unconventional methods, such as analyzing students’ brain waves and heart rates, to determine their emotional states and cognitive loads. This has led to the development of affective computing-based systems that can detect when a student is frustrated or bored and provide personalized interventions to improve their learning experience. For instance, a system might use electroencephalography (EEG) signals to detect when a student is experiencing cognitive overload and provide a simplified explanation of a complex concept. Another bizarre approach involves using artificial intelligence to generate personalized learning content based on a student’s favorite hobbies or interests. For example, a student who loves playing soccer might be provided with math problems that involve calculating the trajectory of a soccer ball or determining the optimal strategy for a soccer game. While this approach may seem unorthodox, it has been shown to increase student engagement and motivation, particularly among students who might otherwise be disinterested in traditional learning materials. Furthermore, some researchers have investigated the use of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) to create immersive learning experiences that simulate real-world scenarios. This has led to the development of VR-based systems that can simulate complex laboratory experiments, allowing students to conduct experiments in a safe and controlled environment. Additionally, AR-based systems can provide students with interactive 3D models and simulations that can be used to visualize complex concepts and phenomena. In a surprising twist, some studies have found that AI-driven personalization can have unintended consequences, such as exacerbating existing biases and inequalities in education. For instance, a system that relies on historical data to make predictions about student performance might perpetuate existing biases and discrimination, particularly if the data is biased or incomplete. This has led to calls for more transparent and accountable AI systems that can provide explanations for their decisions and recommendations. 2 Overall, the field of AI-driven personalization in online education platforms is rapidly evolving, with new and innovative approaches being developed to improve student learning outcomes and experiences. While some of these approaches may seem unconventional or even bizarre, they offer a glimpse into the potential of AI to transform the education sector and provide more effective and engaging learning experiences for students. 3 Methodology To develop an AI-driven personalization framework for online education platforms, we employed a multifaceted approach, incorporating both traditional machine learning techniques and unconventional methods inspired by the works of avant-garde artists. The process commenced with the collection of a vast dataset comprising student demographics, learning patterns, and performance metrics, which were then preprocessed to eliminate inconsistencies and anomalies. However, in a deliberate attempt to introduce randomness, we also integrated a module that periodically injected nonsensical data points, ostensibly to stimulate the model’s creative thinking capabilities. The next stage involved the implementation of a neural network architecture, specifically designed to handle the complexities of personalized learning. This architecture consisted of multiple layers, each responsible for a distinct aspect of the personalization process, such as content recommendation, learning pathway optimization, and emotional support. Notably, one of the layers was dedicated to generating surrealistic art pieces, which, although seemingly unrelated to the primary objective, were believed to contribute to the model’s ability to think outside the box and devise innovative solutions. In a surprising twist, we discovered that the model’s performance improved significantly when ex- posed to a constant stream of philosophical quotes, which were fed into the system through a specially designed module. This phenomenon, which we refer to as ""philosophical resonance,"" appeared to enhance the model’s capacity for critical thinking and nuanced decision-making. Furthermore, the incorporation of a ""daydreaming"" module, which allowed the model to periodically disengage from its primary tasks and engage in aimless contemplation, yielded unexpected benefits in terms of the model’s ability to adapt to novel situations and respond creatively to unforeseen challenges. The development of the framework also involved collaboration with a group of performance artists, who contributed to the project by providing their unique perspectives on the nature of learning and personalization. Their input led to the creation of an immersive, virtual reality-based interface, which enabled students to interact with the model in a highly intuitive and engaging manner. Although this interface was not directly related to the core functionality of the model, it was found to have a profound impact on student motivation and overall learning outcomes. Throughout the development process, we encountered numerous unexpected challenges and anoma- lies, which, rather than being viewed as obstacles, were embraced as opportunities for growth and innovation. The model’s propensity for generating cryptic messages and abstract art pieces, for instance, was initially perceived as a flaw, but ultimately led to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between human and artificial intelligence. Similarly, the model’s tendency to occasion- ally ""freeze"" and enter a state of prolonged introspection was found to be a necessary precursor to breakthroughs in performance and personalized learning outcomes. The resulting framework, which we have dubbed ""Erebus,"" has been shown to exhibit extraordinary capabilities in terms of personalized learning and adaptation, often surpassing human instructors in its ability to provide tailored support and guidance. While the underlying mechanisms driving Erebus’ performance are not yet fully understood, it is clear that the model’s unorthodox design and develop- ment process have yielded a truly innovative and effective approach to AI-driven personalization in online education platforms. 4 Experiments To investigate the efficacy of edible biopolymers in sustainable packaging, we designed a comprehen- sive experimental framework comprising multiple stages. Firstly, we developed a novel biopolymer extraction protocol from a range of organic sources, including algae, cornstarch, and potato starch. The biopolymers were then subjected to various chemical and physical treatments to enhance their mechanical strength, water resistance, and biodegradability. 3 A critical aspect of our experimental design involved the incorporation of an unconventional approach, wherein we utilized sound waves to modulate the molecular structure of the biopolymers. This involved exposing the biopolymer samples to a carefully curated playlist of classical music, with the hypothesis that the sonic vibrations would induce a reorganization of the molecular chains, leading to improved material properties. The biopolymer samples were placed in a specially designed acoustic chamber, where they were treated with a continuous loop of Mozart’s symphonies for a period of 48 hours. In addition to the sonic treatment, we also investigated the effects of various additives on the biopolymer’s performance. These additives included natural antioxidants, such as vitamin E and rosemary extract, as well as micro-scale reinforcements, such as cellulose nanofibers and graphene oxide nanoparticles. The biopolymer compositions were then molded into various packaging forms, including films, containers, and capsules, using a combination of casting, molding, and 3D printing techniques. The packaged products were subsequently tested for their barrier properties, mechanical strength, and biodegradation rates under various environmental conditions. The experimental matrix included a range of factors, such as temperature, humidity, and microbial exposure, to simulate real-world packaging scenarios. The data collected from these experiments will provide valuable insights into the potential of edible biopolymers as a sustainable alternative to conventional packaging materials. Table 1: Biopolymer formulation and treatment conditions Biopolymer Source Additive Sonic Treatment Temperature (◦C) Humidity (%) Sample Code Algae Vitamin E Yes 25 50 AE-1 Cornstarch Cellulose nanofibers No 30 60 CE-2 Potato starch Rosemary extract Yes 20 40 PE-3 Algae Graphene oxide No 25 50 AE-4 Cornstarch None Yes 30 60 CE-5 The experiments were conducted in a controlled laboratory setting, with careful attention paid to ensuring the accuracy and reproducibility of the results. The use of edible biopolymers in packaging applications offers a promising solution to the growing problem of plastic waste, and our research aims to contribute to the development of more sustainable and environmentally friendly packaging materials. 5 Results The experimental results of our investigation into sustainable packaging with edible biopolymers yielded a plethora of intriguing findings. We discovered that by incorporating a specific blend of edible biopolymers, derived from a combination of plant-based materials and microbial fermentation, we could create packaging materials that not only reduced environmental waste but also possessed unique properties that defied conventional logic. For instance, our edible biopolymer packaging was found to be capable of changing color in response to changes in humidity, allowing for a novel approach to monitoring food freshness. Furthermore, the biodegradable nature of these materials enabled them to be easily composted, reducing the environmental impact of traditional packaging methods. One of the most striking aspects of our research was the observation that the edible biopolymers exhibited a form of ""collective intelligence,"" whereby the material appeared to adapt and respond to its environment in a manner that was not fully understood. This phenomenon was observed when the packaging material was exposed to certain types of music, which seemed to influence its structural integrity and longevity. Specifically, our results showed that exposure to classical music, particularly the works of Mozart, resulted in a significant increase in the material’s shelf life, whereas exposure to heavy metal music had a detrimental effect. To further investigate these findings, we conducted a series of experiments in which we subjected the edible biopolymer packaging to various environmental conditions, including changes in temperature, humidity, and light exposure. The results of these experiments are summarized in the following table: 4 Table 2: Effects of environmental conditions on edible biopolymer packaging Condition Color Change Shelf Life Structural Integrity High Humidity Yes 30% decrease 20% decrease Low Temperature No 20% increase 15% increase Mozart’s Music No 40% increase 30% increase Heavy Metal Music Yes 50% decrease 40% decrease These results suggest that the edible biopolymer packaging material is highly sensitive to its en- vironment and can be influenced by a range of factors, including music and humidity. While the exact mechanisms underlying these effects are not yet fully understood, our findings have significant implications for the development of sustainable packaging materials that can respond and adapt to changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, the potential applications of this technology extend far beyond the realm of packaging, with possible uses in fields such as biomedicine and environmental monitoring. Overall, our research has opened up new avenues of investigation into the properties and potential uses of edible biopolymers, and we look forward to continuing our exploration of this fascinating and complex material. 6 Conclusion In summary, the development of sustainable packaging with edible biopolymers has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach food packaging, providing a more environmentally friendly and healthy alternative to traditional packaging materials. This innovative approach not only reduces plastic waste but also offers a unique opportunity for consumers to ingest the packaging itself, potentially providing additional nutritional benefits. Furthermore, the use of edible biopolymers in packaging could also lead to the creation of new and exotic flavors, as the biopolymers can be derived from a wide range of sources, including fruits, vegetables, and even insects. However, it is also important to consider the potential drawbacks of this approach, such as the risk of contamination and the need for strict quality control measures to ensure the safety of the packaging for human consumption. Additionally, the idea of using edible biopolymers as packaging material also raises interesting philosophical questions, such as whether it is morally justifiable to eat a wrapper that has been used to contain a food product, and whether this practice could lead to a blurring of the lines between food and packaging. To take this concept to the next level, it would be interesting to explore the possibility of using edible biopolymers to create packaging that can change flavor and texture in response to different environmental stimuli, such as temperature or humidity, creating a truly immersive and dynamic eating experience. Ultimately, the future of sustainable packaging with edible biopolymers holds much promise, and it will be exciting to see how this technology develops and evolves in the coming years, potentially leading to a world where packaging is not only sustainable but also edible and interactive. 5 ",0,,,,
P005.pdf,"Analyzing Real-Time Group Coordination in Augmented Dance Performances: An LSTM-Based Gesture Modeling Approach Abstract The convergence of augmented reality (AR) and flamenco dance offers a novel research avenue to explore group cohesion through gesture forecasting. By employ- ing LSTM neural networks, this study predicts dancers’ gestures and correlates accuracy with synchronization, emotional expression, and creativity—key cohesion metrics. A ""virtual flamenco guru"" provides real-time feedback, enhancing synchronization and fostering gesture resonance, where dancers align movements via a shared vir- tual space. AR amplifies this effect, especially with gesture-sensing garments. This interdisciplinary research highlights flamenco’s cultural depth, therapeutic bene- fits, and technological applications in dance therapy, human-computer interaction, and entertainment, pushing the boundaries of creativity and collective behavior analysis. 1 Introduction The realm of coordinated dance rituals has long been a fascinating area of study, with the intricate patterns and movements of synchronized performances captivating audiences and inspiring new avenues of research. Among the various forms of dance, flamenco stands out for its passionate and expressive nature, characterized by complex hand and foot movements that require a high degree of coordination and timing. Recent advancements in augmented reality (AR) technology have opened up new possibilities for enhancing and analyzing these performances, allowing for the creation of immersive and interactive experiences that blur the lines between the physical and virtual worlds. One of the key challenges in evaluating the effectiveness of coordinated dance rituals is assessing the level of group cohesion among the performers. This can be a difficult task, as it requires measuring the complex interactions and relationships between individual dancers, as well as their ability to work together as a cohesive unit. Traditional methods of evaluation, such as surveys and interviews, can provide some insight into the dynamics of the group, but they are often limited by their subjective nature and inability to capture the nuances of nonverbal communication. In response to these limitations, researchers have begun to explore the use of machine learning algorithms, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, to forecast and analyze the gestures and movements of dancers. These models have shown great promise in their ability to learn and predict complex patterns of movement, allowing for a more objective and quantitative assessment of group cohesion. By analyzing the accuracy of these predictions, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to successful coordinated dance performances, and develop new strategies for improving the cohesion and effectiveness of dance groups. However, the application of LSTM-based gesture forecasting to coordinated dance rituals is not without its challenges. One of the most significant difficulties is the need to develop a system that can accurately capture and interpret the complex movements and gestures of the dancers. This requires the creation of sophisticated sensors and data collection systems, capable of tracking the subtle nuances of human movement and expression. Furthermore, the development of effective LSTM models requires large amounts of high-quality training data, which can be difficult to obtain, especially in the context of highly specialized and nuanced forms of dance such as flamenco. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of using AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting to evaluate group cohesion in coordinated dance rituals are substantial. By providing a more objective and quantitative means of assessing performance, these technologies can help to identify areas for improvement and optimize the training and rehearsal processes. Additionally, the use of AR can enhance the overall experience of the performance, allowing audience members to engage with the dance in new and innovative ways, and creating a more immersive and interactive experience. In a bizarre twist, some researchers have even begun to explore the use of LSTM-based gesture forecasting in conjunction with other, more unconventional forms of movement analysis, such as the study of chicken entrails and the patterns of tea leaves. While these approaches may seem unorthodox, they have reportedly yielded some surprising insights into the nature of group cohesion and the factors that contribute to successful coordinated dance performances. For example, one study found that the patterns of tea leaves could be used to predict the likelihood of a dancer stumbling or making a mistake, allowing for the development of targeted interventions and improvements to the rehearsal process. Furthermore, the use of AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting has also been shown to have a number of unexpected benefits, such as improving the dancers’ ability to communicate with each other through subtle cues and gestures. By providing a more nuanced and detailed understanding of the complex interactions between dancers, these technologies can help to facilitate a more cohesive and effective performance, and even enhance the overall artistic expression of the dance. In some cases, the use of AR has even been shown to alter the dancers’ perception of their own bodies and movements, allowing them to develop a greater sense of awareness and control over their actions. In addition to its practical applications, the study of coordinated dance rituals and group cohesion also raises a number of interesting theoretical questions, such as the nature of collective consciousness and the role of nonverbal communication in shaping group dynamics. By exploring these questions through the lens of AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting, researchers can gain a deeper under- standing of the complex factors that contribute to successful group performances, and develop new insights into the fundamental nature of human interaction and cooperation. The intersection of AR, LSTM-based gesture forecasting, and coordinated dance rituals also has significant implications for our understanding of the relationship between technology and art. As these technologies continue to evolve and improve, they are likely to have a profound impact on the way we experience and interact with dance and other forms of performance art. By providing new tools and platforms for creative expression, AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting can help to push the boundaries of what is possible in the world of dance, and create new and innovative forms of artistic expression. Overall, the study of coordinated dance rituals and group cohesion through the lens of AR and LSTM- based gesture forecasting is a rich and complex field, full of surprising insights and unexpected discoveries. As researchers continue to explore the possibilities of these technologies, they are likely to uncover new and innovative ways of analyzing and understanding the complex dynamics of group performance, and develop new strategies for improving the cohesion and effectiveness of dance groups. Whether through the use of conventional methods or more unconventional approaches, such as the study of chicken entrails and tea leaves, the application of AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting to coordinated dance rituals is an area of study that is sure to yield a wealth of fascinating and thought-provoking results. 2 Related Work The intersection of augmented reality (AR) and synchronized flamenco dance has garnered significant attention in recent years, as researchers seek to harness the potential of immersive technologies to enhance group cohesion and interpersonal coordination. A plethora of studies have investigated the role of AR in facilitating collaborative dance performances, with a particular emphasis on the development of novel gesture recognition systems and predictive modeling techniques. Notably, the application of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks has emerged as a dominant approach in 2 the field, owing to their capacity to effectively capture the complex temporal dynamics of human movement. One intriguing line of inquiry has focused on the use of AR-enabled feedback loops to synchronize the movements of multiple dancers, thereby fostering a sense of collective rhythm and cohesion. This has involved the creation of bespoke AR systems that provide real-time visual and auditory cues to participants, allowing them to adjust their movements in accordance with the predicted gestures of their counterparts. Interestingly, some researchers have explored the incorporation of unconventional feedback modalities, such as tactile and olfactory stimuli, in an effort to further enhance the sense of immersion and interpersonal connection among dancers. A related thread of research has examined the potential of AR-based gesture forecasting to facilitate the creation of novel, AI-generated flamenco choreographies. By leveraging LSTM networks to predict the likelihood of specific gestures and movements, researchers have been able to generate Complex, algorithmically-driven dance sequences that can be performed in synchronization by multiple dancers. This has raised fascinating questions regarding the role of human agency and creativity in the development of AR-mediated choreographies, and has prompted some scholars to investigate the potential for hybrid human-AI collaborative frameworks that can facilitate the co-creation of innovative dance performances. In a somewhat unexpected turn, some researchers have begun to explore the application of AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting in the context of non-human dance partners, such as robots and animals. This has involved the development of bespoke AR systems that can detect and predict the movements of these non-human entities, allowing human dancers to engage in synchronized performances with their artificial or animal counterparts. While this line of inquiry may seem unconventional, it has yielded some remarkable insights into the fundamental principles of movement and coordination, and has highlighted the potential for AR and machine learning to facilitate novel forms of interspecies collaboration and creativity. Furthermore, a number of studies have investigated the cultural and historical contexts of flamenco dance, and have examined the ways in which AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting can be used to preserve and promote traditional flamenco practices. This has involved the creation of digital archives and repositories of flamenco choreographies, which can be used to train LSTM networks and generate new, AI-driven dance sequences that are grounded in the cultural heritage of flamenco. Interestingly, some researchers have also explored the potential for AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting to facilitate the development of new, fusion-based flamenco styles that blend traditional techniques with contemporary influences and innovations. In addition to these developments, there has been a growing interest in the use of AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting to investigate the cognitive and neural basis of group cohesion and interpersonal coordination in dance. This has involved the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) to study the brain activity of dancers as they engage in synchronized performances, and has yielded some fascinating insights into the neural mechanisms that underlie human movement and coordination. Moreover, some researchers have begun to explore the potential for AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting to facilitate the development of novel, dance-based therapies for individuals with neurological or developmental disorders, such as autism and Parkinson’s disease. Theoretical frameworks, such as the concept of ""extended cognition,"" have also been applied to the study of AR and synchronized flamenco, highlighting the ways in which the use of immersive technologies can facilitate the creation of shared, distributed cognitive systems that span the bound- aries of individual dancers. This has prompted some scholars to investigate the potential for AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting to enable new forms of collective intelligence and creativity, in which the movements and gestures of individual dancers are used to generate emergent, group-level patterns and choreographies. Moreover, a growing body of research has examined the potential for AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting to facilitate the creation of novel, site-specific flamenco performances that are tailored to the unique architectural and environmental features of a given location. This has involved the development of bespoke AR systems that can detect and respond to the spatial and temporal characteristics of a performance environment, and has yielded some remarkable insights into the 3 ways in which the use of immersive technologies can be used to enhance the sense of presence and engagement among audience members. In an effort to further advance the field, some researchers have begun to explore the potential for AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting to facilitate the development of novel, virtual reality (VR)-based flamenco experiences that can be accessed remotely by users around the world. This has raised important questions regarding the potential for VR and AR to democratize access to flamenco and other forms of dance, and has highlighted the need for further research into the social and cultural implications of these emerging technologies. Additionally, some scholars have investigated the potential for AR and LSTM-based gesture fore- casting to facilitate the creation of novel, data-driven flamenco choreographies that are generated using large datasets of human movement and gesture. This has involved the development of bespoke machine learning algorithms that can analyze and interpret the complex patterns and structures that underlie human dance, and has yielded some fascinating insights into the fundamental principles of movement and coordination. The use of AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting has also been explored in the context of dance education, where it has been used to create novel, interactive learning systems that can provide real-time feedback and guidance to students. This has raised important questions regarding the potential for AR and machine learning to facilitate the development of more effective and engaging dance pedagogies, and has highlighted the need for further research into the cognitive and neural basis of dance learning and expertise. Some researchers have also begun to investigate the potential for AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting to facilitate the creation of novel, immersive flamenco experiences that incorporate multiple sensory modalities, such as sound, touch, and smell. This has involved the development of bespoke AR systems that can provide a range of multisensory stimuli to users, and has yielded some remarkable insights into the ways in which the use of immersive technologies can enhance the sense of presence and engagement among audience members. The integration of AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting with other emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), has also been explored in the context of flamenco and dance. This has raised important questions regarding the potential for these technologies to facilitate the creation of novel, hybrid forms of dance and performance that combine human and machine elements, and has highlighted the need for further research into the social and cultural implications of these developments. In another vein, some scholars have begun to investigate the potential for AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting to facilitate the creation of novel, participatory flamenco performances that involve the active engagement of audience members. This has involved the development of bespoke AR systems that can detect and respond to the movements and gestures of audience members, and has yielded some fascinating insights into the ways in which the use of immersive technologies can facilitate the creation of more interactive and immersive forms of dance and performance. Finally, a growing body of research has examined the potential for AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting to facilitate the preservation and promotion of traditional flamenco practices and cultural heritage. This has involved the creation of digital archives and repositories of flamenco choreogra- phies, which can be used to train LSTM networks and generate new, AI-driven dance sequences that are grounded in the cultural heritage of flamenco. Interestingly, some researchers have also explored the potential for AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting to facilitate the development of novel, fusion-based flamenco styles that blend traditional techniques with contemporary influences and innovations, highlighting the potential for these emerging technologies to facilitate the creation of new, hybrid forms of cultural expression and identity. 3 Methodology To investigate the relationship between Augmented Reality (AR) and synchronized Flamenco dance, we employed a multidisciplinary approach, combining techniques from computer science, psychology, and dance theory. Our methodology consisted of several stages, including data collection, participant recruitment, and the development of a bespoke LSTM-based gesture forecasting system. We began by recruiting a cohort of 50 experienced Flamenco dancers, who were tasked with performing 4 a series of coordinated dance rituals while wearing AR-enabled wristbands. These wristbands, which we designed and fabricated in-house, utilized a combination of accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors to capture the dancers’ movements with high spatial and temporal resolution. The AR component of our system was implemented using a custom-built application, which utilized a headset-mounted display to provide the dancers with real-time feedback on their movements. This feedback took the form of a virtual ""gesture trail,"" which allowed the dancers to visualize their own movements, as well as those of their peers, in a shared virtual environment. We hypothesized that this shared feedback mechanism would facilitate enhanced group cohesion and coordination among the dancers, and we designed a series of experiments to test this hypothesis. One of the key challenges we faced in developing our system was the need to balance the requirements of real-time feedback and high-fidelity motion capture. To address this challenge, we implemented a novel approach, which we term ""temporally-compressed gesture forecasting."" This approach involves using a combination of machine learning algorithms and signal processing techniques to compress the temporal dimension of the motion capture data, while preserving the underlying patterns and structures of the dancers’ movements. We found that this approach allowed us to achieve high-quality motion capture data, while also reducing the computational overhead of our system and enabling real-time feedback. In addition to the technical challenges, we also encountered a number of unexpected issues during the data collection process. For example, we found that the dancers’ movements were often influenced by a range of external factors, including the music, the lighting, and even the color of the walls in the dance studio. To address these issues, we developed a novel ""context-aware"" gesture forecasting system, which utilized a combination of environmental sensors and machine learning algorithms to predict the dancers’ movements based on the surrounding context. We found that this approach allowed us to achieve significantly improved accuracy in our gesture forecasting model, and we were able to demonstrate a strong positive correlation between the predicted gestures and the actual movements of the dancers. Another unexpected finding that emerged from our research was the discovery that the dancers’ movements were often influenced by a range of subconscious factors, including their emotional state, their level of fatigue, and even their personal relationships with their fellow dancers. To investigate this phenomenon, we developed a novel ""emotional contagion"" framework, which utilized a combination of psychological surveys, physiological sensors, and machine learning algorithms to predict the emotional state of the dancers based on their movements. We found that this approach allowed us to identify a range of subtle patterns and correlations in the data, which would have been difficult or impossible to detect using more traditional methods. We also explored the use of unconventional machine learning architectures, such as a bespoke ""Flamenco-inspired"" neural network, which was designed to mimic the complex rhythms and patterns of traditional Flamenco music. This approach involved using a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural network layers to model the temporal and spatial structure of the dancers’ movements, and we found that it allowed us to achieve state-of-the-art performance in gesture forecasting and recognition. However, we also encountered a number of challenges and limitations when working with this approach, including the need for large amounts of labeled training data and the risk of overfitting to the specific patterns and structures of the Flamenco dance style. In an effort to further enhance the accuracy and robustness of our system, we also investigated the use of a range of alternative and complementary sensing modalities, including electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). We found that these modalities provided a rich source of additional information about the dancers’ movements and emotional state, and we were able to integrate them into our existing system using a range of sensor fusion and machine learning techniques. However, we also encountered a number of practical challenges and limitations when working with these modalities, including the need for specialized equipment and expertise, and the risk of signal noise and artifact contamination. Despite these challenges, we were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a range of experimental evaluations, including a large-scale study involving over 100 participants and a series of smaller-scale pilots and proof-of-concept demonstrations. We found that our system was able to achieve high levels of accuracy and robustness in gesture forecasting and recognition, and we were able to demonstrate a strong positive correlation between the predicted gestures and the actual 5 movements of the dancers. We also received positive feedback from the participants, who reported that the system was easy to use and provided a range of benefits, including improved coordination and cohesion, enhanced creativity and self-expression, and increased overall enjoyment and engagement. In conclusion, our research demonstrates the potential of AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting to enhance group cohesion and coordination in coordinated dance rituals. While our approach is still in the early stages of development, we believe that it has the potential to make a significant impact in a range of applications, from dance and performance to education and therapy. We are excited to continue exploring the possibilities of this technology, and we look forward to seeing where it will take us in the future. We are also considering exploring other genres of dance, such as ballet or contemporary, to see if our approach can be applied more broadly. Additionally, we are planning to investigate the use of our system in other domains, such as sports or rehabilitation, where coordinated movement and gesture forecasting could be beneficial. Overall, our research highlights the potential of interdisciplinary approaches to drive innovation and advance our understanding of complex phenomena, and we are excited to see where this line of inquiry will lead us in the future. 4 Experiments To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the relationship between Augmented Reality (AR) and synchronized flamenco, we designed a series of experiments that would not only assess the impact of AR on group cohesion but also delve into the intricacies of gesture forecasting using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The experiments were carried out over the course of several months, involving a diverse group of participants with varying levels of experience in flamenco dance. The experimental setup consisted of a large, specially designed dance studio equipped with AR technology that could project a myriad of patterns and cues onto the floor and surrounding walls. This allowed the dancers to receive real-time feedback and guidance on their movements, which was expected to enhance their synchronization and overall performance. The studio was also outfitted with a state-of-the-art motion capture system, capable of tracking the precise movements of each dancer, thus providing valuable data for the LSTM-based gesture forecasting model. Before commencing the experiments, all participants underwent an intensive training program aimed at familiarizing them with the basics of flamenco and the operation of the AR system. This included understanding how to interpret the AR cues, how to adjust their movements based on the feedback received, and how to work cohesively as a group. The training program was divided into two phases: the first phase focused on individual skill development, where each participant learned the fundamental steps and rhythms of flamenco. The second phase concentrated on group cohesion, where participants practiced dancing together, emphasizing synchronization and coordination. Upon completing the training program, the participants were divided into several groups, each with a distinct dynamic. Some groups consisted of dancers with similar skill levels and experience, while others were deliberately mixed to include beginners, intermediate, and advanced dancers. This diversity was intended to observe how different group compositions affected cohesion and the ability to forecast gestures accurately. The experimental protocol involved several sessions, each lasting approximately two hours. During these sessions, the dancers performed a variety of flamenco routines, with and without the AR feedback. Their movements were captured by the motion tracking system, and the data were fed into the LSTM model for analysis. The model was tasked with predicting the next gesture or movement based on the patterns observed in the data. Interestingly, the model began to exhibit an unexpected behavior, frequently predicting movements that seemed unrelated to flamenco, such as gestures from ballet or even what appeared to be fragments of a traditional African dance. This phenomenon, which we termed ""Cross-Cultural Gesture Drift,"" posed an intriguing question about the potential for LSTM models to not only learn from the data they are trained on but also to draw from a broader, unexplored reservoir of cultural knowledge. To further explore this phenomenon, we introduced an unconventional variable into our experiment: the influence of ambient music from different cultural backgrounds on the dancers’ movements and the LSTM’s predictions. The results were astounding, with the model’s predictions becoming increasingly eclectic and incorporating elements from the ambient music genres. For instance, when the background music shifted to a vibrant salsa rhythm, the model began to predict movements that 6 were distinctly more energetic and spontaneous, diverging significantly from the traditional flamenco repertoire. Conversely, when the ambient music was a soothing melody from a Japanese traditional instrument, the predictions became more subdued and introspective, reflecting the serene quality of the music. Table 1: Cross-Cultural Gesture Drift Observations Session Ambient Music Genre Predicted Gestures Divergence from Flamenco 1 Traditional Flamenco High accuracy, minimal divergence 5% 2 African Folk Introduction of non-flamenco gestures 20% 3 Contemporary Ballet Predictions included ballet movements 35% 4 Salsa Increased energy and spontaneity 40% 5 Japanese Traditional Predictions became more subdued 15% The incorporation of ambient music and the observation of Cross-Cultural Gesture Drift added a new layer of complexity to our study, suggesting that the relationship between AR, flamenco, and gesture forecasting is influenced by a broader cultural context. This finding opens up novel avenues for research, including the potential for using AR and LSTM models to create new, hybrid dance forms that blend elements from different cultural traditions. Furthermore, it raises questions about the role of technology in preserving cultural heritage versus promoting innovation and fusion. In a bizarre turn of events, one of the sessions was interrupted by an unexpected visit from a group of wild flamenco enthusiasts, who, upon witnessing the experiment, spontaneously joined in, adding their own flair and energy to the performance. This unplanned intrusion not only disrupted the controlled environment of the experiment but also led to one of the most captivating and cohesive performances observed throughout the study. The LSTM model, faced with this unexpected input, surprisingly adapted and began to predict gestures that were not only accurate but also seemed to capture the essence and passion of the impromptu dancers. This serendipitous event underscored the importance of spontaneity and community in dance, as well as the potential for AR and LSTM models to facilitate and enhance these aspects. It also highlighted the limitations of controlled experiments in fully capturing the dynamic, often unpredictable nature of human creativity and expression. In response, we have begun to explore the development of more flexible, adaptive experimental designs that can accommodate and even encourage unexpected events, viewing them as opportunities for growth and discovery rather than disruptions to be controlled. The experiments concluded with a grand finale, where all participants gathered for a final, AR-guided flamenco performance. The event was open to the public and attracted a diverse audience, all of whom were mesmerized by the synchronization, energy, and evident joy of the dancers. The LSTM model, having learned from the myriad of experiences and data collected throughout the study, performed flawlessly, predicting gestures with a high degree of accuracy and even seeming to contribute to the spontaneity and creativity of the performance. In reflection, the experiments not only provided valuable insights into the use of AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting in enhancing group cohesion in synchronized flamenco but also ventured into uncharted territories, exploring the intersection of technology, culture, and human expression. The findings, replete with unexpected turns and surprising revelations, underscore the complexity and richness of this intersection, beckoning further research and innovation in this captivating field. 5 Results Our investigation into the intersection of Augmented Reality (AR) and synchronized flamenco dancing, with a focus on evaluating group cohesion through LSTM-based gesture forecasting,yielded a plethora of intriguing results. Initially, we observed that the integration of AR elements into the flamenco performances enhanced the dancers’ ability to synchronize their movements, thereby fostering a heightened sense of group cohesion. This phenomenon was particularly evident when the AR components were designed to provide real-time feedback on gesture accuracy and timing, allowing the dancers to adjust their movements in tandem. The LSTM-based gesture forecasting model, trained on a dataset comprising various flamenco dance sequences, demonstrated a remarkable capacity to predict the subsequent gestures of individual 7 dancers. Notably, when this predictive capability was leveraged to generate AR cues that guided the dancers’ movements, the overall cohesion of the group improved significantly. However, an unexpected outcome emerged when the model was fed a dataset that included gestures from other, unrelated dance forms, such as ballet and hip-hop. In these instances, the LSTM model began to generate forecasts that, while inaccurate in the context of flamenco, inadvertently created a unique fusion of dance styles.

P006.pdf,"Detailed Action Identification in Baseball Game Recordings Abstract This research introduces MLB-YouTube, a new and complex dataset created for nuanced activity recognition in baseball videos. This dataset is structured to support two types of analysis: one for classifying activities in segmented videos and another for detecting activities in unsegmented, continuous video streams. This study evaluates several methods for recognizing activities, focusing on how they capture the temporal organization of activities in videos. This evaluation starts with categorizing segmented videos and progresses to applying these methods to continuous video feeds. Additionally, this paper assesses the effectiveness of different models in the challenging task of forecasting pitch velocity and type using baseball broadcast videos. The findings indicate that incorporating temporal dynamics into models is beneficial for detailed activity recognition. 1 Introduction Action recognition, a significant problem in computer vision, finds extensive use in sports. Profes- sional sporting events are extensively recorded for entertainment, and these recordings are invaluable for subsequent analysis by coaches, scouts, and media analysts. While numerous game statistics are currently gathered manually, the potential exists for these to be replaced by computer vision systems. Systems like PITCHf/x and Statcast have been employed by Major League Baseball (MLB) to automatically record pitch speed and movement, utilizing a network of high-speed cameras and radar to collect detailed data on each player. Access to much of this data is restricted from the public domain. This paper introduces MLB-YouTube, a novel dataset that includes densely annotated frames of activi- ties extracted from broadcast baseball videos. Unlike many current datasets for activity recognition or detection, our dataset emphasizes fine-grained activity recognition. The differences between activities are often minimal, primarily involving the movement of a single individual, with a consistent scene structure across activities. The determination of activity is based on a single camera perspective. This study compares various methods for temporal feature aggregation, both for classifying activities in segmented videos and for detecting them in continuous video streams. 2 Related Work The field of activity recognition has garnered substantial attention in computer vision research. Initial successes were achieved with hand-engineered features such as dense trajectories. The focus of more recent studies has shifted towards the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for activity recognition. Two-stream CNN architectures utilize both spatial RGB frames and optical flow frames. To capture spatio-temporal characteristics, 3D XYT convolutional models have been developed. The development of these advanced CNN models has been supported by large datasets such as Kinetics, THUMOS, and ActivityNet. Several studies have investigated the aggregation of temporal features for the purpose of activity recognition. Research has compared several pooling techniques and determined that both Long Short- . Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and max-pooling across entire videos yielded the best outcomes. It has been discovered that pooling intervals from varying locations and durations is advantageous for activity recognition. It was demonstrated that identifying and classifying key sub-event intervals can lead to better performance. Recently, segment-based 3D CNNs have been employed to capture spatio-temporal data concurrently for activity detection. These methods depend on the 3D CNN to capture temporal dynamics, which typically span only 16 frames. Although longer-term temporal structures have been explored, this was usually accomplished with temporal pooling of localized features or (spatio-)temporal convolutions with extended fixed intervals. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have also been applied to represent transitions in activity between frames. 3 MLB-YouTube Dataset We have compiled an extensive dataset from 20 baseball games of the 2017 MLB postseason, available on YouTube, totaling over 42 hours of video. Our dataset includes two main parts: segmented videos intended for activity recognition and continuous videos designed for activity classification. The dataset’s complexity is amplified by the fact that it originates from televised baseball games, where a single camera perspective is shared among various activities. Additionally, there is minimal variance in motion and appearance among different activities, such as swinging a bat versus bunting. In contrast to datasets like THUMOS and ActivityNet, which encompass a broad spectrum of activities with diverse settings, scales, and camera angles, our dataset features activities where a single frame might not be adequate to determine the activity. The minor differences between a ball and a strike are illustrated in Figure 3. Differentiating between these actions requires identifying whether the batter swings or not, detecting the umpire’s signal (Figure 4) for a strike, or noting the absence of a signal for a ball. This is further complicated because the batter or catcher can obstruct the umpire, and each umpire has their unique style of signaling a strike. Our dataset for segmented video analysis comprises 4,290 clips. Each clip is annotated for multiple baseball actions, including swing, hit, ball, strike, and foul. Given that a single clip may contain several activities, this is considered a multi-label classification task. Table 1 presents the complete list of activities and their respective counts within the dataset. Additionally, clips featuring a pitch were annotated with the type of pitch (e.g., fastball, curveball, slider) and its speed. Furthermore, a collection of 2,983 hard negative examples, where no action is present, was gathered. These instances include views of the crowd, the field, or players standing idly before or after a pitch. Examples of activities and hard negatives are depicted in Figure 2. Our continuous video dataset includes 2,128 clips, each lasting between 1 and 2 minutes. Every frame in these videos is annotated with the baseball activities that occur. On average, each continuous clip contains 7.2 activities, amounting to over 15,000 activity instances in total. Table 1: Activity classes and their instance counts in the segmented MLB-YouTube dataset. Activity Count No Activity 2983 Ball 1434 Strike 1799 Swing 2506 Hit 1391 Foul 718 In Play 679 Bunt 24 Hit by Pitch 14 2 4 Segmented Video Recognition Approach We investigate different techniques for aggregating temporal features in segmented video activity recognition. In segmented videos, the classification task is simpler because each frame corresponds to an activity, eliminating the need for the model to identify the start and end of activities. Our methods are based on a CNN that generates a per-frame or per-segment representation, derived from standard two-stream CNNs using deep CNNs like I3D or InceptionV3. Given video features v of dimensions T × D, where T represents the video’s temporal length and D is the feature’s dimensionality, the usual approach for feature pooling involves max- or mean-pooling across the temporal dimension, followed by a fully-connected layer for video clip classification, as depicted in Fig. 5(a). This approach, however, yields a single representation for the entire video, losing temporal information. An alternative is to employ a fixed temporal pyramid with various lengths, as shown in Fig 5(b), dividing the video into intervals of lengths 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8, and max-pooling each. The pooled features are concatenated, creating a K × D representation, where K is the number of intervals in the temporal pyramid, and a fully-connected layer classifies the clip. We also explore learning temporal convolution filters to aggregate local temporal structures. A kernel of size L×1 is applied to each frame, enabling each timestep representation to incorporate information from adjacent frames. After applying max-pooling to the output of the temporal convolution, a fully- connected layer is used for classification, as illustrated in Fig. 5(c). While temporal pyramid pooling retains some structure, the intervals are fixed and predetermined. Previous studies have shown that learning the sub-interval to pool is beneficial for activity recognition. These learned intervals are defined by three parameters: a center g, a width σ, and a stride δ, parameterizing N Gaussians. Given the video length T, the positions of the strided Gaussians are first calculated as: gn = 0.5 −T −(gn + 1) N −1 forn = 0, 1, . . . , N −1 pt,n = gn + (t −0.5T + 0.5)1 δ fort = 0, 1, . . . , T −1 The filters are then generated as: Fm[i, t] = 1 Zm exp  −(t −µi,m)2 2σ2m  i ∈{0, 1, . . . , N −1}, t ∈{0, 1, . . . , T −1} where Zm is a normalization constant. We apply these filters F to the T × D video representation through matrix multiplication, yielding an N × D representation that serves as input to a fully-connected layer for classification. This method is shown in Fig 5(d). Additionally, we compare a bi-directional LSTM with 512 hidden units, using the final hidden state as input to a fully-connected layer for classification. We frame our tasks as multi-label classification and train these models to minimize binary cross-entropy: L(v) = X c zc log(p(c|G(v))) + (1 −zc) log(1 −p(c|G(v))) where G(v) is the function that pools the temporal information, and zc is the ground truth label for class c. 5 Activity Detection in Continuous Videos Detecting activities in continuous videos poses a greater challenge. The goal here is to classify each frame according to the activities occurring. Unlike segmented videos, continuous videos feature multiple sequential activities, often interspersed with frames of inactivity. This necessitates that the model learn to identify the start and end points of activities. As a baseline, we train a single fully-connected layer to serve as a per-frame classifier, which does not utilize temporal information beyond that contained in the features. 3 We adapt the methods developed for segmented video classification to continuous videos by imple- menting a temporal sliding window approach. We select a fixed window duration of L features, apply max-pooling to each window (similar to Fig. 5(a)), and classify each pooled segment. This approach is extended to temporal pyramid pooling by dividing the window of length L into segments of lengths L/2, L/4, and L/8, resulting in 14 segments per window. Max-pooling is applied to each segment, and the pooled features are concatenated, yielding a 14 × D-dimensional representation for each window, which is then used as input to the classifier. For temporal convolutional models in continuous videos, we modify the segmented video approach by learning a temporal convolutional kernel of length L and convolving it with the input video features. This operation transforms input of size T × D into output of size T × D, followed by a per-frame classifier. This enables the model to aggregate local temporal information. To extend the sub-event model to continuous videos, we follow a similar approach but set T = L in Eq. 1, resulting in filters of length L. The T ×D video representation is convolved with the sub-event filters F, producing an N × D × T-dimensional representation used as input to a fully-connected layer for frame classification. The model is trained to minimize per-frame binary classification: L(v) = X t,c zt,c log(p(c|H(vt))) + (1 −zt,c) log(1 −p(c|H(vt))) where vt is the per-frame or per-segment feature at time t, H(vt) is the sliding window application of one of the feature pooling methods, and zt,c is the ground truth class at time t. A method to learn ’super-events’ (i.e., global video context) has been introduced and shown to be effective for activity detection in continuous videos. This approach involves learning a set of temporal structure filters modeled as N Cauchy distributions. Each distribution is defined by a center xn and a width γn. Given the video length T, the filters are constructed by: xn = (T −1)(tanh(x′ n) + 1) 2 fn(t) = 1 Zn γn π((t −xn)2 + γ2n) exp(1 −2| tanh(γ′ n)|) where Zn is a normalization constant, t ∈{1, 2, . . . , T}, and n ∈{1, 2, . . . , N}. The filters are combined with learned per-class soft-attention weights A, and the super-event repre- sentation is computed as: Sc = X n Ac,n X t fn(t) · vt where v is the T × D video representation. These filters enable the model to focus on relevant intervals for temporal context. The super-event representation is concatenated to each timestep and used for classification. We also experiment with combining the super- and sub-event representations to form a three-level hierarchy for event representation. 6 Experiments 6.1 Implementation Details For our base per-segment CNN, we utilize the I3D network, pre-trained on the ImageNet and Kinetics datasets. I3D has achieved state-of-the-art performance on segmented video tasks, providing a reliable feature representation. We also employ a two-stream version of InceptionV3, pre-trained on Imagenet and Kinetics, as our base per-frame CNN for comparison. InceptionV3 was chosen for its depth compared to previous two-stream CNNs. Frames were extracted at 25 fps, and TVL1 optical flow was computed and clipped to [−20, 20]. For InceptionV3, features were computed every 3 frames (8 fps), while for I3D, every frame was used, with I3D having a temporal stride of 8, resulting in 3 features per second (3 fps). Models were implemented in PyTorch and trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01, decayed by a factor of 0.1 every 10 epochs, for a total of 50 epochs. 4 6.2 Segmented Video Activity Recognition We initially conducted binary pitch/non-pitch classification for each video segment. This task is relatively straightforward due to the distinct differences between pitch and non-pitch frames. The results, detailed in Table 2, reveal minimal variation across different features or models. Table 2: Performance on segmented videos for binary pitch/non-pitch classification.

Table 4 compares the performance of these methods. All methods surpass mean/max-pooling, highlighting the importance of preserving temporal structure for activity recognition. Fixed temporal pyramid pooling and LSTMs show some improvement. Temporal convolution offers a more significant performance boost but requires substantially more parameters (see Table 3). Learning sub-events, as per previous research, yields the best results. While LSTMs and temporal convolutions have been used before, they need more parameters and perform less effectively, likely due to overfitting. Moreover, LSTMs necessitate sequential processing of video features, whereas other methods can be fully parallelized. Table 3: Additional parameters required for models when added to the base model (e.g., I3D or Inception V3).

Learning temporal structure is particularly beneficial for frame-based features (e.g., InceptionV3), which capture less temporal information 5 compared to segment-based features (e.g., I3D). Sub-event learning significantly aids in detecting strikes, hits, foul balls, and hit-by-pitch events, which exhibit changes in video features post-event. For instance, after a hit, the camera often tracks the ball’s trajectory, while after a hit-by-pitch, it follows the player to first base, as illustrated in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. Table 5: Per-class average precision for segmented videos using two-stream features in multi- label activity classification. Utilizing sub-events to discern temporal intervals of interest proves advantageous for activity recognition.

The baseball, often obscured by the pitcher, travels at speeds over 100mph and covers 60.5 feet in approximately 0.5 seconds. Initially, with frame rates of 8fps and 3fps, only 1-2 features captured the pitch in mid-air, proving insufficient for speed determination. Utilizing the 60fps rate available in YouTube videos, we recalculated optical flow and extracted RGB frames at this higher rate. Employing a fully-connected layer with a single output for pitch speed prediction and minimizing the L1 loss between predicted and actual speeds, we achieved an average error of 3.6mph. Table 6 compares different models, and Fig. 8 illustrates the sub-events learned for various speeds. Table 6: Results for pitch speed regression on segmented videos, reporting root-mean-squared errors.

We incorporated pose data extracted using OpenPose, utilizing heatmaps of joint and body part locations as input to a newly trained InceptionV3 CNN. Pose features were considered due to variations in body mechanics between different pitches. Our dataset includes six pitch types, with results presented in Table 7. LSTMs performed worse than the baseline, likely due to overfitting, whereas learning sub-events proved beneficial. Fastballs were the easiest to detect (68% accuracy), followed by sliders (45%), while sinkers were the most difficult (12%). 6.3 Continuous Video Activity Detection We evaluate models extended for continuous videos using per-frame mean average precision (mAP), with results shown in Table 8. This setting is more challenging than segmented videos, requiring the model to identify activity start and end times and handle ambiguous negative examples. All models improve upon the baseline per-frame classification, confirming the importance of temporal information.

P007.pdf,"Advancements in 3D Food Modeling: A Review of the MetaFood Challenge Techniques and Outcomes Abstract The growing focus on leveraging computer vision for dietary oversight and nutri- tion tracking has spurred the creation of sophisticated 3D reconstruction methods for food. The lack of comprehensive, high-fidelity data, coupled with limited collaborative efforts between academic and industrial sectors, has significantly hindered advancements in this domain. This study addresses these obstacles by introducing the MetaFood Challenge, aimed at generating precise, volumetrically accurate 3D food models from 2D images, utilizing a checkerboard for size cal- ibration. The challenge was structured around 20 food items across three levels of complexity: easy (200 images), medium (30 images), and hard (1 image). A total of 16 teams participated in the final assessment phase. The methodologies developed during this challenge have yielded highly encouraging outcomes in 3D food reconstruction, showing great promise for refining portion estimation in dietary evaluations and nutritional tracking. Further information on this workshop challenge and the dataset is accessible via the provided URL. 1 Introduction The convergence of computer vision technologies with culinary practices has pioneered innovative approaches to dietary monitoring and nutritional assessment. The MetaFood Workshop Challenge represents a landmark initiative in this emerging field, responding to the pressing demand for precise and scalable techniques for estimating food portions and monitoring nutritional consumption. Such technologies are vital for fostering healthier eating behaviors and addressing health issues linked to diet. By concentrating on the development of accurate 3D models of food derived from various visual inputs, including multiple views and single perspectives, this challenge endeavors to bridge the disparity between current methodologies and practical needs. It promotes the creation of unique solutions capable of managing the intricacies of food morphology, texture, and illumination, while also meeting the real-world demands of dietary evaluation. This initiative gathers experts from computer vision, machine learning, and nutrition science to propel 3D food reconstruction technologies forward. These advancements have the potential to substantially enhance the precision and utility of food portion estimation across diverse applications, from individual health tracking to extensive nutritional investigations. Conventional methods for assessing diet, like 24-Hour Recall or Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQs), are frequently reliant on manual data entry, which is prone to inaccuracies and can be burdensome. The lack of 3D data in 2D RGB food images further complicates the use of regression- based methods for estimating food portions directly from images of eating occasions. By enhancing 3D reconstruction for food, the aim is to provide more accurate and intuitive nutritional assessment tools. This technology could revolutionize the sharing of culinary experiences and significantly impact nutrition science and public health. Participants were tasked with creating 3D models of 20 distinct food items from 2D images, mim- icking scenarios where mobile devices equipped with depth-sensing cameras are used for dietary . recording and nutritional tracking. The challenge was segmented into three tiers of difficulty based on the number of images provided: approximately 200 images for easy, 30 for medium, and a single top-view image for hard. This design aimed to rigorously test the adaptability and resilience of proposed solutions under various realistic conditions. A notable feature of this challenge was the use of a visible checkerboard for physical referencing and the provision of depth images for each frame, ensuring the 3D models maintained accurate real-world measurements for portion size estimation. This initiative not only expands the frontiers of 3D reconstruction technology but also sets the stage for more reliable and user-friendly real-world applications, including image-based dietary assessment. The resulting solutions hold the potential to profoundly influence nutritional intake monitoring and comprehension, supporting broader health and wellness objectives. As progress continues, innovative applications are anticipated to transform personal health management, nutritional research, and the wider food industry. The remainder of this report is structured as follows: Section 2 delves into the existing literature on food portion size estimation, Section 3 describes the dataset and evaluation framework used in the challenge, and Sections 4, 5, and 6 discuss the methodologies and findings of the top three teams (VolETA, ININ-VIAUN, and FoodRiddle), respectively. 2 Related Work Estimating food portions is a crucial part of image-based dietary assessment, aiming to determine the volume, energy content, or macronutrients directly from images of meals. Unlike the well-studied task of food recognition, estimating food portions is particularly challenging due to the lack of 3D information and physical size references necessary for accurately judging the actual size of food portions. Accurate portion size estimation requires understanding the volume and density of food, elements that are hard to deduce from a 2D image, underscoring the need for sophisticated techniques to tackle this problem. Current methods for estimating food portions are grouped into four categories. Stereo-Based Approaches use multiple images to reconstruct the 3D structure of food. Some methods estimate food volume using multi-view stereo reconstruction based on epipolar geometry, while others perform two-view dense reconstruction. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has also been used for continuous, real-time food volume estimation. However, these methods are limited by their need for multiple images, which is not always practical. Model-Based Approaches use predefined shapes and templates to estimate volume. For instance, certain templates are assigned to foods from a library and transformed based on physical references to estimate the size and location of the food. Template matching approaches estimate food volume from a single image, but they struggle with variations in food shapes that differ from predefined templates. Recent work has used 3D food meshes as templates to align camera and object poses for portion size estimation. Depth Camera-Based Approaches use depth cameras to create depth maps, capturing the distance from the camera to the food. These depth maps form a voxel representation used for volume estimation. The main drawback is the need for high-quality depth maps and the extra processing required for consumer-grade depth sensors. Deep Learning Approaches utilize neural networks trained on large image datasets for portion estimation. Regression networks estimate the energy value of food from single images or from an ""Energy Distribution Map"" that maps input images to energy distributions. Some networks use both images and depth maps to estimate energy, mass, and macronutrient content. However, deep learning methods require extensive data for training and are not always interpretable, with performance degrading when test images significantly differ from training data. While these methods have advanced food portion estimation, they face limitations that hinder their widespread use and accuracy. Stereo-based methods are impractical for single images, model-based approaches struggle with diverse food shapes, depth camera methods need specialized hardware, and deep learning approaches lack interpretability and struggle with out-of-distribution samples. 3D reconstruction offers a promising solution by providing comprehensive spatial information, adapting to various shapes, potentially working with single images, offering visually interpretable results, and enabling a standardized approach to food portion estimation. These benefits motivated the organization of the 3D Food Reconstruction challenge, aiming to overcome existing limitations and 2 develop more accurate, user-friendly, and widely applicable food portion estimation techniques, impacting nutritional assessment and dietary monitoring. 3 Datasets and Evaluation Pipeline 3.1 Dataset Description The dataset for the MetaFood Challenge features 20 carefully chosen food items from the MetaFood3D dataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy in the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern mat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty, determined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction: • Easy: Around 200 images taken from video. • Medium: 30 images. • Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective. Table 1 details the food items included in the dataset. Table 1: MetaFood Challenge Data Details Object Index Food Item Difficulty Level Number of Frames 1 Strawberry Easy 199 2 Cinnamon bun Easy 200 3 Pork rib Easy 200 4 Corn Easy 200 5 French toast Easy 200 6 Sandwich Easy 200 7 Burger Easy 200 8 Cake Easy 200 9 Blueberry muffin Medium 30 10 Banana Medium 30 11 Salmon Medium 30 12 Steak Medium 30 13 Burrito Medium 30 14 Hotdog Medium 30 15 Chicken nugget Medium 30 16 Everything bagel Hard 1 17 Croissant Hard 1 18 Shrimp Hard 1 19 Waffle Hard 1 20 Pizza Hard 1 3.2 Evaluation Pipeline The evaluation process is split into two phases, focusing on the accuracy of the reconstructed 3D models in terms of shape (3D structure) and portion size (volume). 3.2.1 Phase-I: Volume Accuracy In the first phase, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is used to evaluate portion size accuracy, calculated as follows: MAPE = 1 n n X i=1  Ai −Fi Ai  × 100% (1) 3 where Ai is the actual volume (in ml) of the i-th food item obtained from the scanned 3D food mesh, and Fi is the volume calculated from the reconstructed 3D mesh. 3.2.2 Phase-II: Shape Accuracy Teams that perform well in Phase-I are asked to submit complete 3D mesh files for each food item. This phase involves several steps to ensure precision and fairness: • Model Verification: Submitted models are checked against the final Phase-I submissions for consistency, and visual inspections are conducted to prevent rule violations. • Model Alignment: Participants receive ground truth 3D models and a script to compute the final Chamfer distance. They must align their models with the ground truth and prepare a transformation matrix for each submitted object. The final Chamfer distance is calculated using these models and matrices. • Chamfer Distance Calculation: Shape accuracy is assessed using the Chamfer distance metric. Given two point sets X and Y , the Chamfer distance is defined as: dCD(X, Y ) = 1 |X| X x∈X min y∈Y ∥x −y∥2 2 + 1 |Y | X y∈Y min x∈X ∥x −y∥2 2 (2) This metric offers a comprehensive measure of similarity between the reconstructed 3D models and the ground truth. The final ranking is determined by combining scores from both Phase-I (volume accuracy) and Phase-II (shape accuracy). Note that after the Phase-I evaluation, quality issues were found with the data for object 12 (steak) and object 15 (chicken nugget), so these items were excluded from the final overall evaluation. 4 First Place Team - VolETA 4.1 Methodology The team’s research employs multi-view reconstruction to generate detailed food meshes and calculate precise food volumes. 4.1.1 Overview The team’s method integrates computer vision and deep learning to accurately estimate food volume from RGBD images and masks. Keyframe selection ensures data quality, supported by perceptual hashing and blur detection. Camera pose estimation and object segmentation pave the way for neural surface reconstruction, creating detailed meshes for volume estimation. Refinement steps, including isolated piece removal and scaling factor adjustments, enhance accuracy. This approach provides a thorough solution for accurate food volume assessment, with potential uses in nutrition analysis. 4.1.2 The Team’s Proposal: VolETA The team starts by acquiring input data, specifically RGBD images and corresponding food object masks. The RGBD images, denoted as ID = {IDi}n i=1, where n is the total number of frames, provide depth information alongside RGB images. The food object masks, {M f i }n i=1, help identify regions of interest within these images. Next, the team selects keyframes. From the set {IDi}n i=1, keyframes {IK j }k j=1 ⊆{IDi}n i=1 are chosen. A method is implemented to detect and remove duplicate and blurry images, ensuring high-quality frames. This involves applying a Gaussian blurring kernel followed by the fast Fourier transform method. Near-Image Similarity uses perceptual hashing and Hamming distance threshold- ing to detect similar images and retain overlapping ones. Duplicates and blurry images are excluded to maintain data integrity and accuracy. Using the selected keyframes {IK j }k j=1, the team estimates camera poses through a method called PixSfM, which involves extracting features using SuperPoint, matching them with SuperGlue, and refining them. The outputs are the camera poses {Cj}k j=1, crucial for understanding the scene’s spatial layout. 4 In parallel, the team uses a tool called SAM for reference object segmentation. SAM segments the reference object with a user-provided prompt, producing a reference object mask M R for each keyframe. This mask helps track the reference object across all frames. The XMem++ method extends the reference object mask M R to all frames, creating a comprehensive set of reference object masks {M R i }n i=1. This ensures consistent reference object identification throughout the dataset. To create RGBA images, the team combines RGB images, reference object masks {M R i }n i=1, and food object masks {M F i }n i=1. This step, denoted as {IR i }n i=1, integrates various data sources into a unified format for further processing. The team converts the RGBA images {IR i }n i=1 and camera poses {Cj}k j=1 into meaningful metadata and modeled data Dm. This transformation facilitates accurate scene reconstruction. The modeled data Dm is input into NeuS2 for mesh reconstruction. NeuS2 generates colorful meshes {Rf, Rr} for the reference and food objects, providing detailed 3D representations. The team uses the ""Remove Isolated Pieces"" technique to refine the meshes. Given that the scenes contain only one food item, the diameter threshold is set to 5% of the mesh size. This method deletes isolated connected components with diameters less than or equal to 5%, resulting in a cleaned mesh {RCf, RCr}. This step ensures that only significant parts of the mesh are retained. The team manually identifies an initial scaling factor S using the reference mesh via MeshLab. This factor is fine-tuned to Sf using depth information and food and reference masks, ensuring accurate scaling relative to real-world dimensions. Finally, the fine-tuned scaling factor Sf is applied to the cleaned food mesh RCf, producing the final scaled food mesh RF f. This step culminates in an accurately scaled 3D representation of the food object, enabling precise volume estimation. 4.1.3 Detecting the scaling factor Generally, 3D reconstruction methods produce unitless meshes by default. To address this, the team manually determines the scaling factor by measuring the distance for each block of the reference object mesh. The average of all block lengths lavg is calculated, while the actual real-world length is constant at lreal = 0.012 meters. The scaling factor S = lreal/lavg is applied to the clean food mesh RCf, resulting in the final scaled food mesh RF f in meters. The team uses depth information along with food and reference object masks to validate the scaling factors. The method for assessing food size involves using overhead RGB images for each scene. Initially, the pixel-per-unit (PPU) ratio (in meters) is determined using the reference object. Subse- quently, the food width (fw) and length (fl) are extracted using a food object mask. To determine the food height (fh), a two-step process is followed. First, binary image segmentation is performed using the overhead depth and reference images, yielding a segmented depth image for the reference object. The average depth is then calculated using the segmented reference object depth (dr). Similarly, employing binary image segmentation with an overhead food object mask and depth image, the average depth for the segmented food depth image (df) is computed. The estimated food height fh is the absolute difference between dr and df. To assess the accuracy of the scaling factor S, the food bounding box volume (fw × fl × fh) × PPU is computed. The team evaluates if the scaling factor S generates a food volume close to this potential volume, resulting in Sfine. Table 2 lists the scaling factors, PPU, 2D reference object dimensions, 3D food object dimensions, and potential volume. For one-shot 3D reconstruction, the team uses One-2-3-45 to reconstruct a 3D model from a single RGBA view input after applying binary image segmentation to both food RGB and mask images. Isolated pieces are removed from the generated mesh, and the scaling factor S, which is closer to the potential volume of the clean mesh, is reused. 4.2 Experimental Results 4.2.1 Implementation settings Experiments were conducted using two GPUs: GeForce GTX 1080 Ti/12G and RTX 3060/6G. The Hamming distance for near image similarity was set to 12. For Gaussian kernel radius, even numbers in the range [0...30] were used for detecting blurry images. The diameter for removing isolated pieces was set to 5%. NeuS2 was run for 15,000 iterations with a mesh resolution of 512x512, a unit cube ""aabb scale"" of 1, ""scale"" of 0.15, and ""offset"" of [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] for each food scene. 5 4.2.2 VolETA Results The team extensively validated their approach on the challenge dataset and compared their results with ground truth meshes using MAPE and Chamfer distance metrics. The team’s approach was applied separately to each food scene. A one-shot food volume estimation approach was used if the number of keyframes k equaled 1; otherwise, a few-shot food volume estimation was applied. Notably, the keyframe selection process chose 34.8% of the total frames for the rest of the pipeline, showing the minimum frames with the highest information.

After generating scaled meshes, the team calculated volumes and Chamfer distance with and without transformation metrics. Meshes were registered with ground truth meshes using ICP to obtain transformation metrics. Table 3 presents quantitative comparisons of the team’s volumes and Chamfer distance with and without estimated transformation metrics from ICP. For overall method performance, Table 4 shows the MAPE and Chamfer distance with and without transformation metrics. Additionally, qualitative results on one- and few-shot 3D reconstruction from the challenge dataset are shown. The model excels in texture details, artifact correction, missing data handling, and color adjustment across different scene parts. Limitations: Despite promising results, several limitations need to be addressed in future work: • Manual processes: The current pipeline includes manual steps like providing segmentation prompts and identifying scaling factors, which should be automated to enhance efficiency. • Input requirements: The method requires extensive input information, including food masks and depth data. Streamlining these inputs would simplify the process and increase applicability. • Complex backgrounds and objects: The method has not been tested in environments with complex backgrounds or highly intricate food objects. • Capturing complexities: The method has not been evaluated under different capturing complexities, such as varying distances and camera speeds. • Pipeline complexity: For one-shot neural rendering, the team currently uses One-2-3-45. They aim to use only the 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to reduce complexity and improve efficiency. 6 Table 3: Quantitative Comparison with Ground Truth Using Chamfer Distance L Id Team’s Vol. GT Vol. Ch. w/ t.m Ch. w/o t.m 1 40.06 38.53 1.63 85.40 2 216.9 280.36 7.12 111.47 3 278.86 249.67 13.69 172.88 E 4 279.02 295.13 2.03 61.30 5 395.76 392.58 13.67 102.14 6 205.17 218.44 6.68 150.78 7 372.93 368.77 4.70 66.91 8 186.62 173.13 2.98 152.34 9 224.08 232.74 3.91 160.07 10 153.76 163.09 2.67 138.45 M 11 80.4 85.18 3.37 151.14 13 363.99 308.28 5.18 147.53 14 535.44 589.83 4.31 89.66 16 163.13 262.15 18.06 28.33 H 17 224.08 181.36 9.44 28.94 18 25.4 20.58 4.28 12.84 19 110.05 108.35 11.34 23.98 20 130.96 119.83 15.59 31.05 Table 4: Quantitative Comparison with Ground Truth Using MAPE and Chamfer Distance MAPE Ch. w/ t.m Ch. w/o t.m (%) sum mean sum mean 10.973 0.130 0.007 1.715 0.095 5 Second Place Team - ININ-VIAUN 5.1 Methodology This section details the team’s proposed network, illustrating the step-by-step process from original images to final mesh models. 5.1.1 Scale factor estimation The procedure for estimating the scale factor at the coordinate level is illustrated in Figure 9. The team adheres to a method involving corner projection matching. Specifically, utilizing the COLMAP dense model, the team acquires the pose of each image along with dense point cloud data. For any given image imgk and its extrinsic parameters [R|t]k, the team initially performs threshold-based corner detection, setting the threshold at 240. This step allows them to obtain the pixel coordinates of all detected corners. Subsequently, using the intrinsic parameters k and the extrinsic parameters [R|t]k, the point cloud is projected onto the image plane. Based on the pixel coordinates of the corners, the team can identify the closest point coordinates P k i for each corner, where i represents the index of the corner. Thus, they can calculate the distance between any two corners as follows: Dk ij = (P k i −P k j )2 ∀i ̸= j (3) To determine the final computed length of each checkerboard square in image k, the team takes the minimum value of each row of the matrix Dk (excluding the diagonal) to form the vector dk. The median of this vector is then used. The final scale calculation formula is given by Equation 4, where 0.012 represents the known length of each square (1.2 cm): scale = 0.012 Pn i=1 med(dk) (4) 7 5.1.2 3D Reconstruction The 3D reconstruction process, depicted in Figure 10, involves two different pipelines to accommodate variations in input viewpoints. The first fifteen objects are processed using one pipeline, while the last five single-view objects are processed using another. For the initial fifteen objects, the team uses COLMAP to estimate poses and segment the food using the provided segment masks. Advanced multi-view 3D reconstruction methods are then applied to reconstruct the segmented food. The team employs three different reconstruction methods: COLMAP, DiffusioNeRF, and NeRF2Mesh. They select the best reconstruction results from these methods and extract the mesh. The extracted mesh is scaled using the estimated scale factor, and optimization techniques are applied to obtain a refined mesh. For the last five single-view objects, the team experiments with several single-view reconstruction methods, including Zero123, Zero123++, One2345, ZeroNVS, and DreamGaussian. They choose ZeroNVS to obtain a 3D food model consistent with the distribution of the input image. The intrinsic camera parameters from the fifteenth object are used, and an optimization method based on reprojection error refines the extrinsic parameters of the single camera. Due to limitations in single-view reconstruction, depth information from the dataset and the checkerboard in the monocular image are used to determine the size of the extracted mesh. Finally, optimization techniques are applied to obtain a refined mesh. 5.1.3 Mesh refinement During the 3D Reconstruction phase, it was observed that the model’s results often suffered from low quality due to holes on the object’s surface and substantial noise, as shown in Figure 11. To address the holes, MeshFix, an optimization method based on computational geometry, is em- ployed. For surface noise, Laplacian Smoothing is used for mesh smoothing operations. The Laplacian Smoothing method adjusts the position of each vertex to the average of its neighboring vertices: V (new) i = V (old) i + λ   1 |N(i)| X j∈N(i) V (old) j −V (old) i   (5) In their implementation, the smoothing factor λ is set to 0.2, and 10 iterations are performed. 5.2 Experimental Results 5.2.1 Estimated scale factor The scale factors estimated using the described method are shown in Table 5. Each image and the corresponding reconstructed 3D model yield a scale factor, and the table presents the average scale factor for each object. 5.2.2 Reconstructed meshes The refined meshes obtained using the described methods are shown in Figure 12. The predicted model volumes, ground truth model volumes, and the percentage errors between them are presented in Table 6. 5.2.3 Alignment The team designs a multi-stage alignment method for evaluating reconstruction quality. Figure 13 illustrates the alignment process for Object 14. First, the central points of both the predicted and ground truth models are calculated, and the predicted model is moved to align with the central point of the ground truth model. Next, ICP registration is performed for further alignment, significantly reducing the Chamfer distance. Finally, gradient descent is used for additional fine-tuning to obtain the final transformation matrix. The total Chamfer distance between all 18 predicted models and the ground truths is 0.069441169. 8 Table 5: Estimated Scale Factors Object Index Food Item Scale Factor 1 Strawberry 0.060058 2 Cinnamon bun 0.081829 3 Pork rib 0.073861 4 Corn 0.083594 5 French toast 0.078632 6 Sandwich 0.088368 7 Burger 0.103124 8 Cake 0.068496 9 Blueberry muffin 0.059292 10 Banana 0.058236 11 Salmon 0.083821 13 Burrito 0.069663 14 Hotdog 0.073766 Table 6: Metric of Volume Object Index Predicted Volume Ground Truth Error Percentage 1 44.51 38.53 15.52 2 321.26 280.36 14.59 3 336.11 249.67 34.62 4 347.54 295.13 17.76 5 389.28 392.58 0.84 6 197.82 218.44 9.44 7 412.52 368.77 11.86 8 181.21 173.13 4.67 9 233.79 232.74 0.45 10 160.06 163.09 1.86 11 86.0 85.18 0.96 13 334.7 308.28 8.57 14 517.75 589.83 12.22 16 176.24 262.15 32.77 17 180.68 181.36 0.37 18 13.58 20.58 34.01 19 117.72 108.35 8.64 20 117.43 119.83 20.03 6 Best 3D Mesh Reconstruction Team - FoodRiddle 6.1 Methodology To achieve high-fidelity food mesh reconstruction, the team developed two procedural pipelines as depicted in Figure 14. For simple and medium complexity cases, they employed a structure-from- motion strategy to ascertain the pose of each image, followed by mesh reconstruction. Subsequently, a sequence of post-processing steps was implemented to recalibrate the scale and improve mesh quality. For cases involving only a single image, the team utilized image generation techniques to facilitate model generation. 6.1.1 Multi-View Reconstruction For Structure from Motion (SfM), the team enhanced the advanced COLMAP method by integrating SuperPoint and SuperGlue techniques. This integration significantly addressed the issue of limited keypoints in scenes with minimal texture, as illustrated in Figure 15. In the mesh reconstruction phase, the team’s approach builds upon 2D Gaussian Splatting, which employs a differentiable 2D Gaussian renderer and includes regularization terms for depth distortion 9 and normal consistency. The Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) results are utilized to produce a dense point cloud. During post-processing, the team applied filtering and outlier removal methods, identified the outline of the supporting surface, and projected the lower mesh vertices onto this surface. They utilized the reconstructed checkerboard to correct the model’s scale and employed Poisson reconstruction to create a complete, watertight mesh of the subject. 6.1.2 Single-View Reconstruction For 3D reconstruction from a single image, the team utilized advanced methods such as LGM, Instant Mesh, and One-2-3-45 to generate an initial mesh. This initial mesh was then refined in conjunction with depth structure information. To adjust the scale, the team estimated the object’s length using the checkerboard as a reference, assuming that the object and the checkerboard are on the same plane. They then projected the 3D object back onto the original 2D image to obtain a more precise scale for the object. 6.2 Experimental Results Through a process of nonlinear optimization, the team sought to identify a transformation that minimizes the Chamfer distance between their mesh and the ground truth mesh. This optimization aimed to align the two meshes as closely as possible in three-dimensional space. Upon completion of this process, the average Chamfer dis- tance across the final reconstructions of the 20 objects amounted to 0.0032175 meters. As shown in Table 7, Team FoodRiddle achieved the best scores for both multi- view and single-view reconstructions, outperforming other teams in the competition.

The challenge sought to enhance 3D reconstruction methods by concentrating on food items, tackling the distinct difficulties presented by varied textures, reflective surfaces, and intricate geometries common in culinary subjects. The competition involved 20 diverse food items, captured under various conditions and with differing numbers of input images, specifically designed to challenge participants in creating robust reconstruc- tion models. The evaluation was based on a two-phase process, assessing both portion size accuracy through Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and shape accuracy using the Chamfer distance metric. Of all participating teams, three reached the final submission stage, presenting a range of innovative solutions. Team VolETA secured first place with the best overall performance in both Phase-I and Phase-II, followed by team ININ-VIAUN in second place. Additionally, the FoodRiddle team exhibited superior performance in Phase-II, highlighting a competitive and high-caliber field of entries for 3D mesh reconstruction. The challenge has successfully advanced the field of 3D food reconstruction, demonstrating the potential for accurate volume estimation and shape reconstruction in nutritional analysis and food presentation applications. The novel methods developed by the participating teams establish a strong foundation for future research in this area, potentially leading to more precise and user-friendly approaches for dietary assessment and monitoring. 10",1,,,,
P008.pdf,"Advanced techniques for through and contextually Interpreting Noun-Noun Compounds Abstract This study examines the effectiveness of transfer learning and multi-task learning in the context of a complex semantic classification problem: understanding the meaning of noun-noun compounds. Through a series of detailed experiments and an in-depth analysis of errors, we demonstrate that employing transfer learning by initializing parameters and multi-task learning through parameter sharing enables a neural classification model to better generalize across a dataset characterized by a highly uneven distribution of semantic relationships. Furthermore, we illustrate how utilizing dual annotations, which involve two distinct sets of relations applied to the same compounds, can enhance the overall precision of a neural classifier and improve its F1 scores for less common yet more challenging semantic relations. 1 Introduction Noun-noun compound interpretation involves determining the semantic connection between two nouns (or noun phrases in multi-word compounds). For instance, in the compound ""street protest,"" the task is to identify the semantic relationship between ""street"" and ""protest,"" which is a locative relation in this example. Given the prevalence of noun-noun compounds in natural language and its significance to other natural language processing (NLP) tasks like question answering and information retrieval, understanding noun-noun compounds has been extensively studied in theoretical linguistics, psycholinguistics, and computational linguistics. In computational linguistics, noun-noun compound interpretation is typically treated as an automatic classification task. Various machine learning (ML) algorithms and models, such as Maximum Entropy, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, have been employed to decipher the semantics of nominal compounds. These models utilize information from lexical semantics, like WordNet-based features, and distributional semantics, such as word embeddings. However, noun- noun compound interpretation remains a challenging NLP problem due to the high productivity of noun-noun compounding as a linguistic structure and the difficulty in deriving the semantics of noun-noun compounds from their constituents. Our research contributes to advancing NLP research on noun-noun compound interpretation through the application of transfer and multi-task learning. The application of transfer learning (TL) and multi-task learning (MTL) in NLP has gained significant attention in recent years, yielding varying outcomes based on the specific tasks, model architectures, and datasets involved. These varying results, combined with the fact that neither TL nor MTL has been previously applied to noun-noun compound interpretation, motivate our thorough empirical investigation into the use of TL and MTL for this task. Our aim is not only to add to the existing research on the effectiveness of TL and MTL for semantic NLP tasks generally but also to ascertain their specific advantages for compound interpretation. A key reason for utilizing multi-task learning is to enhance generalization by making use of the domain-specific details present in the training data of related tasks. In this study, we demonstrate that TL and MTL can serve as a form of regularization, enabling the prediction of infrequent relations within a dataset marked by a highly skewed distribution of relations. This dataset is particularly well-suited for TL and MTL experimentation, as elaborated in Section 3. Our contributions are summarized as follows: 1. Through meticulous analysis of results, we discover that TL and MTL, especially when applied to the embedding layer, enhance overall accuracy and F1 scores for less frequent relations in a highly skewed dataset, compared to a robust single-task learning baseline. 2. Although our research concentrates on TL and MTL, we present, to our knowledge, the first experimental results on the relatively recent dataset from Fares (2016). 2 Related Work Approaches to interpreting noun-noun compounds differ based on the classification of compound relations, as well as the machine learning models and features employed to learn these relations. For instance, some define a broad set of relations, while others employ a more detailed classification. Some researchers challenge the idea that noun-noun compounds can be interpreted using a fixed, predetermined set of relations, proposing alternative methods based on paraphrasing. We center our attention on methods that frame the interpretation problem as a classification task involving a fixed, predetermined set of relations. Various machine learning models have been applied to this task, including nearest neighbor classifiers that use semantic similarity based on lexical resources, kernel-based methods like SVMs that utilize lexical and relational features, Maximum Entropy models that incorporate a wide range of lexical and surface form features, and neural networks that rely on word embeddings or combine word embeddings with path embeddings. Among these studies, some have utilized the same dataset. To our knowledge, TL and MTL have not been previously applied to compound interpretation. Therefore, we review prior research on TL and MTL in other NLP tasks. Several recent studies have conducted extensive experiments on the application of TL and MTL to a variety of NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition, semantic labeling, sentence-level sentiment classification, super-tagging, chunking, and semantic dependency parsing. The consensus among these studies is that the advantages of TL and MTL are largely contingent on the characteristics of the tasks involved, including the unevenness of the data distribution, the semantic relatedness between the source and target tasks, the learning trajectory of the auxiliary and main tasks (where target tasks that quickly reach a plateau benefit most from non-plateauing auxiliary tasks), and the structural similarity between the tasks. Besides differing in the NLP tasks they investigate, the aforementioned studies employ slightly varied definitions of TL and MTL. Our research aligns with certain studies in that we apply TL and MTL to learn different semantic annotations of noun-noun compounds using the same dataset. However, our experimental design is more akin to other work in that we experiment with initializing parameters across all layers of the neural network and concurrently train a single MTL model on two sets of relations. 3 Task Definition and Dataset The objective of this task is to train a model to categorize the semantic relationships between pairs of nouns in a labeled dataset, where each pair forms a noun-noun compound. The complexity of this task is influenced by factors such as the label set used and its distribution. For the experiments detailed in this paper, we utilize a noun-noun compounds dataset that features compounds annotated with two distinct taxonomies of relations. This means that each noun-noun compound is associated with two different relations, each based on different linguistic theories. This dataset is derived from established linguistic resources, including NomBank and the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0 (PCEDT). We chose this dataset for two primary reasons: firstly, the dual annotation of relations on the same set of compounds is ideal for exploring TL and MTL approaches; secondly, aligning two different annotation frameworks on the same data allows for a comparative analysis across these frameworks. Specifically, we use a portion of the dataset, focusing on type-based instances of two-word compounds. The original dataset also encompasses multi-word compounds (those made up of more than two nouns) and multiple instances per compound type. We further divide the dataset into three parts: training, development, and test sets. Table 1 details the number of compound types and the vocabulary size for each set, including a breakdown of words appearing in the right-most (right constituents) and left-most (left constituents) positions. The two label sets consist of 35 PCEDT functors and 18 2 NomBank argument and adjunct relations. As discussed in Section 7.1, these label sets have a highly uneven distribution. Table 1: Characteristics of the noun-noun compound dataset used in our experiments. The numbers in this table correspond to a subset of the dataset, see Section 3. Train Dev Test Compounds 6932 920 1759 Vocab size 4102 1163 1772 Right constituents 2304 624 969 Left constituents 2405 618 985 Many relations in PCEDT and NomBank conceptually describe similar semantic ideas, as they are used to annotate the semantics of the same text. For instance, the temporal and locative relations in NomBank (ARGM-TMP and ARGM-LOC, respectively) and their PCEDT counterparts (TWHEN and LOC) exhibit relatively consistent behavior across frameworks, as they annotate many of the same compounds. However, some relations that are theoretically similar do not align well in practice. For example, the functor AIM in PCEDT and the modifier argument ARGM-PNC in NomBank express a somewhat related semantic concept (purpose), but there is minimal overlap between the sets of compounds they annotate. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that the semantic similarity in the label sets, where it exists, can be leveraged through transfer and multi-task learning, especially since the overall distribution of relations differs between the two frameworks. 4 Transfer vs. Multi-Task Learning In this section, we employ the terminology and definitions established by Pan and Yang (2010) to articulate our framework for transfer and multi-task learning. Our classification task can be described in terms of all training pairs (X, Y) and a probability distribution P(X), where X represents the input feature space, Y denotes the set of all labels, and N is the training data size. The domain of a task is defined by X, P(X). Our goal is to learn a function f(X) that predicts Y based on the input features X. Considering two ML tasks, Ta and Tb, we would train two distinct models to learn separate functions fa and fb for predicting Ya and Yb in a single-task learning scenario. However, if Ta and Tb are related, either explicitly or implicitly, TL and MTL can enhance the generalization of either or both tasks. Two tasks are deemed related when their domains are similar but their label sets differ, or when their domains are dissimilar but their label sets are identical. Consequently, noun-noun compound interpretation using the dataset is well-suited for TL and MTL, as the training examples are identical, but the label sets are distinct. For clarity, we differentiate between transfer learning and multi-task learning in this paper, despite these terms sometimes being used interchangeably in the literature. We define TL as the utilization of parameters from a model trained on Ta to initialize another model for Tb. In contrast, MTL involves training parts of the same model to learn both Ta and Tb, essentially learning one set of parameters for both tasks. The concept is to train a single model simultaneously on both tasks, where one task introduces an inductive bias that aids the model in generalizing over the main task. It is important to note that this does not necessarily imply that we aim to use a single model to predict both label sets in practice. 5 Neural Classification Models This section introduces the neural classification models utilized in our experiments. To discern the impact of TL and MTL, we initially present a single-task learning model, which acts as our baseline. Subsequently, we employ this same model to implement TL and MTL. 5.1 Single-Task Learning Model In our single-task learning (STL) configuration, we train and fine-tune a feed-forward neural network inspired by the neural classifier proposed by Dima and Hinrichs (2015). This network comprises four layers: 1) an input layer, 2) an embedding layer, 3) a hidden layer, and 4) an output layer. The input 3 layer consists of two integers that indicate the indices of a compound’s constituents in the embedding layer, where the word embedding vectors are stored. These selected vectors are then passed to a fully connected hidden layer, the size of which matches the dimensionality of the word embedding vectors. Finally, a softmax function is applied to the output layer to select the most probable relation. The compound’s constituents are represented using a 300-dimensional word embedding model trained on an English Wikipedia dump and the English Gigaword Fifth Edition. The embedding model was trained by Fares et al. (2017). If a word is not found during lookup in the embedding model, we check if the word is uppercased and attempt to find the lowercase version. For hyphenated words not found in the embedding vocabulary, we split the word at the hyphen and average the vectors of its parts, if they are present in the vocabulary. If the word remains unrepresented after these steps, a designated vector for unknown words is employed. 5.1.1 Architecture and Hyperparameters Our selection of hyperparameters is informed by multiple rounds of experimentation with the single- task learning model, as well as the choices made by prior work. The weights of the embedding layer are updated during the training of all models. We utilize the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) optimization function across all models, with a learning rate set to 0.001. The loss function employed is the negative-log likelihood. A Sigmoid activation function is used for the units in the hidden layer. All models are trained with mini-batches of size five. The maximum number of epochs is capped at 50, but an early stopping criterion based on the model’s accuracy on the validation split is also implemented. This means that training is halted if the validation accuracy does not improve over five consecutive epochs. All models are implemented in Keras, using TensorFlow as the backend. The TL and MTL models are trained using the same hyperparameters as the STL model. 5.2 Transfer Learning Models In our experiments, transfer learning involves training an STL model on PCEDT relations and then using some of its weights to initialize another model for NomBank relations. Given the neural classifier architecture detailed in Section 5.1, we identify three ways to implement TL: 1) TLE: Transferring the embedding layer weights, 2) TLH: Transferring the hidden layer weights, and 3) TLEH: Transferring both the embedding and hidden layer weights. Furthermore, we differentiate between transfer learning from PCEDT to NomBank and vice versa. This results in six setups, as shown in Table 2. We do not apply TL (or MTL) to the output layer because it is task- or dataset-specific. 5.3 Multi-Task Learning Models In MTL, we train a single model to simultaneously learn both PCEDT and NomBank relations, meaning all MTL models have two objective functions and two output layers. We implement two MTL setups: MTLE, which features a shared embedding layer but two task-specific hidden layers, and MTLF, which has no task-specific layers aside from the output layer (i.e., both the embedding and hidden layers are shared). We distinguish between the auxiliary and main tasks based on which validation accuracy (NomBank’s or PCEDT’s) is monitored by the early stopping criterion. This leads to a total of four MTL models, as shown in Table 3. 6 Experimental Results Tables 2 and 3 display the accuracies of the various TL and MTL models on the development and test splits for NomBank and PCEDT. The top row in both tables indicates the accuracy of the STL model. All models were trained solely on the training split. Several insights can be gleaned from these tables. Firstly, the accuracy of the STL models decreases when evaluated on the test split for both NomBank and PCEDT. Secondly, all TL models achieve improved accuracy on the NomBank test split, although transfer learning does not significantly enhance accuracy on the development split of the same dataset. The MTL models, especially MTLF, have a detrimental effect on the development accuracy of NomBank, yet we observe a similar improvement, as with TL, on the test split. Thirdly, both TL and MTL models demonstrate less consistent effects on PCEDT (on both development and test splits) compared to NomBank. For instance, all TL models yield an absolute improvement of 4 about 1.25 points in accuracy on NomBank, whereas in PCEDT, TLE clearly outperforms the other two TL models (TLE improves over the STL accuracy by 1.37 points). Table 2: Accuracy (%) of the transfer learning models.

This could suggest overfitting, especially since our stopping criterion selects the model with the best performance on the development split. Conversely, TL and MTL enhance accuracy on the test splits, despite using the same stopping criterion as STL. We interpret this as an improvement in the models’ ability to generalize. However, since these improvements are relatively minor, we further analyze the results to understand if and how TL and MTL are beneficial. 7 Results Analysis This section provides a detailed analysis of the models’ performance, drawing on insights from the dataset and the classification errors made by the models. The discussion in the following sections is primarily based on the results from the test split, as it is larger than the development split. 7.1 Relation Distribution To illustrate the complexity of the task, we depict the distribution of the most frequent relations in NomBank and PCEDT across the three data splits in Figure 1. Notably, approximately 71.18% of the relations in the NomBank training split are of type ARG1 (prototypical patient), while 52.20% of the PCEDT relations are of type RSTR (an underspecified adnominal modifier). Such a highly skewed distribution makes learning some of the other relations more challenging, if not impossible in certain cases. In fact, out of the 15 NomBank relations observed in the test split, five are never predicted by any of the STL, TL, or MTL models. Similarly, of the 26 PCEDT relations in the test split, only six are predicted. However, the unpredicted relations are extremely rare in the training split (e.g., 23 PCEDT functors appear less than 20 times), making it doubtful whether any ML model could learn them under any circumstances. Given this imbalanced distribution, it is evident that accuracy alone is insufficient to determine the best-performing model. Therefore, in the subsequent section, we report and analyze the F1 scores of the predicted NomBank and PCEDT relations across all STL, TL, and MTL models. 7.2 Per-Relation F1 Scores Tables 4 and 5 present the per-relation F1 scores for NomBank and PCEDT, respectively. We only include results for relations that are actually predicted by at least one of the models. 5 Table 4: Per-label F1 score on the NomBank test split.

Firstly, the MTLF model appears to be detrimental to both datasets, leading to significantly degraded F1 scores for four NomBank relations, including the locative modifier ARGM-LOC and the manner modifier ARGM-MNR (abbreviated as LOC and MNR in Table 4), which the model fails to predict altogether. This same model exhibits the lowest F1 score compared to all other models for two PCEDT relations: REG (expressing a circumstance) and PAT (patient). Considering that the MTLF model achieves the highest accuracy on the NomBank test split (as shown in Table 3), it becomes even more apparent that relying solely on accuracy scores is inadequate for evaluating the effectiveness of TL and MTL for this task and dataset. Secondly, with the exception of the MTLF model, all TL and MTL models consistently improve the F1 score for all PCEDT relations except PAT. Notably, the F1 scores for the relations TWHEN and ACT show a substantial increase compared to other PCEDT relations when only the embedding layer’s weights are shared (MTLE) or transferred (TLE). This outcome can be partially understood by examining the correspondence matrices between NomBank arguments and PCEDT functors, presented in Tables 7 and 6. These tables illustrate how PCEDT functors map to NomBank arguments in the training split (Table 6) and vice versa (Table 7). Table 6 reveals that 80% of the compounds annotated as TWHEN in PCEDT were annotated as ARGM-TMP in NomBank. Additionally, 47% of ACT (Actor) relations map to ARG0 (Proto-Agent) in NomBank. While this mapping is not as distinct as one might hope, it is still relatively high when compared to how other PCEDT relations map to ARG0. The correspondence matrices also demonstrate that the presumed theoretical similarities between NomBank and PCEDT relations do not always hold in practice. Nevertheless, even such imperfect correspondences can provide a training signal that assists the TL and MTL models in learning relations like TWHEN and ACT. Since the TLE model outperforms STL in predicting REG by ten absolute points, we examined all REG compounds correctly classified by TLE but misclassified by STL. We found that STL misclassified them as RSTR, indicating that TL from NomBank helps TLE recover from STL’s overgeneralization in RSTR prediction. The two NomBank relations that receive the highest boost in F1 score (about five absolute points) are ARG0 and ARGM-MNR, but the improvement in the latter corresponds to only one additional compound, which might be a chance occurrence. Overall, TL and MTL from NomBank to PCEDT are more helpful than the reverse. One explanation is that five PCEDT relations (including the four most frequent ones) map to ARG1 in NomBank in more than 60% of cases for each relation, as seen in the first rows of Tables 6 and 7. This suggests that the weights learned to predict PCEDT relations 6 Table 6: Correspondence matrix between PCEDT functors and NomBank arguments.

Conversely, the mapping from NomBank to PCEDT shows that although many NomBank arguments map to RSTR in PCEDT, the percentages are lower, making the mapping more diverse and discriminative, which seems to aid TL and MTL models in learning less frequent PCEDT relations. To understand why the PCEDT functor AIM is never predicted despite being more frequent than TWHEN, we found that AIM is almost always misclassified as RSTR by all models. Furthermore, AIM and RSTR have the highest lexical overlap in the training set among all PCEDT relation pairs: 78.35% of left constituents and 73.26% of right constituents of compounds annotated as AIM occur in other compounds annotated as RSTR. This explains the models’ inability to learn AIM but raises questions about their ability to learn relational representations, which we explore further in Section 7.3. Table 8: Macro-average F1 score on the test split. Model NomBank PCEDT STL 52.66 40.15 TLE 52.83 48.34 TLH 52.98 46.52 TLEH 53.31 47.12 MTLE 53.21 47.23 MTLF 42.07 40.73 Finally, to demonstrate the benefits of TL and MTL for NomBank and PCEDT, we report the F1 macro-average scores in Table 8. This is arguably the appropriate evaluation measure for imbalanced classification problems. Note that relations not predicted by any model are excluded from the macro- average calculation. Table 8 clearly shows that TL and MTL on the embedding layer yield significant improvements for PCEDT, with about a 7-8 point increase in macro-average F1, compared to just 0.65 in the best case for NomBank. 7 7.3 Generalization on Unseen Compounds We now analyze the models’ ability to generalize to compounds not seen during training. Recent research suggests that gains in noun-noun compound interpretation using word embeddings and similar neural classification models might be due to lexical memorization. In other words, the models learn that specific nouns are strong indicators of specific relations. To assess the role of lexical memorization in our models, we quantify the number of unseen compounds that the STL, TL, and MTL models predict correctly. We differentiate between ’partly’ and ’completely’ unseen compounds. A compound is ’partly’ unseen if one of its constituents (left or right) is not present in the training data. A ’completely’ unseen compound is one where neither the left nor the right constituent appears in the training data. Overall, nearly 20% of the compounds in the test split have an unseen left constituent, about 16% have an unseen right constituent, and 4% are completely unseen. Table 9 compares the performance of the different models on these three groups in terms of the proportion of compounds misclassified in each group. Table 9: Generalization error on the subset of unseen compounds in the test split. L: Left constituent. R: Right constituent. L&R: Completely unseen. NomBank PCEDT Model L R L&R L R L&R Count 351 286 72 351 286 72 STL 27.92 39.51 50.00 45.01 47.55 41.67 TLE 25.93 36.71 48.61 43.87 47.55 41.67 TLH 26.21 38.11 50.00 46.15 49.30 47.22 TLEH 26.50 38.81 52.78 45.87 47.55 43.06 MTLE 24.50 33.22 38.89 44.44 47.20 43.06 MTLF 22.79 34.27 40.28 44.16 47.90 38.89 Table 9 shows that Transfer Learning (TL) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL) approaches reduce generalization error in NomBank across all scenarios, with the exception of TLH and TLEH for completely unseen compounds, where error increases. The greatest error reductions are achieved by MTL models across all three types of unseen compounds. Specifically, MTLE reduces the error by approximately six points for compounds with unseen right constituents and by eleven points for fully unseen compounds. Moreover, MTLF reduces the error by five points when the left constituent is unseen. It’s important to interpret these results in conjunction with the Count row in Table 9 for a comprehensive view. For example, the eleven-point error decrease in fully unseen compounds represents eight compounds. In PCEDT, the largest error reduction is on unseen left constituents, which is about 1.14 points, corresponding to four compounds; it’s 0.35 on unseen right constituents (one compound) and 2.7 on fully unseen compounds, or two compounds. Upon manual inspection of compounds that led to substantial reductions in the generalization error, specifically within NomBank, we examined the distribution of relations within correctly predicted unseen compound sets. Compared to the STL model, MTLE reduces generalization error for completely unseen compounds by a total of eight compounds, of which seven are annotated with the relation ARG1, which is the most common in NomBank. Regarding the unseen right constituents, MTLE’s 24 improved compounds consist of 18 ARG1, 5 ARG0, and 1 ARG2 compounds. A similar pattern arises when examining TLE model improvements, where most gains come from better predictions of ARG1 and ARG0 relations. A large portion of unseen compounds, whether partly or entirely unseen, that were misclassified by every model, were not of type ARG1 in NomBank, or RSTR in PCEDT. This pattern, along with correctly predicted unseen compounds primarily annotated with the most common relations, suggests that classification models rely on lexical memorization to learn the compound relation interpretation. To better comprehend lexical memorization’s impact, we present the ratio of relation-specific con- stituents in both NomBank and PCEDT, as depicted in Figure 2. We define a relation-specific constituent as a left or right constituent that appears with only one specific relation within the training data. Its ratio is calculated as its proportion in the full set of left or right constituents for each 8 relation. Analyzing Figure 2 reveals that NomBank relations possess higher ratios of relation-specific constituents compared to PCEDT. This potentially makes learning the former easier if the model solely relies on lexical memorization. Additionally, ARGM-TMP in NomBank and TWHEN in PCEDT have distinctly high ratios compared to other relations in Figure 2. These relations also have the second-highest F1 score in their datasets—except for STL on PCEDT (see Tables 4 and 5). Lexical memorization is therefore a likely cause of these high F1 scores. We also observed that lower ratios of relation-specific constituents correlate with lower F1 scores, such as APP and REG in PCEDT. Based on these insights, we can’t dismiss the possibility that our models show some degree of lexical memorization, despite manual analysis also presenting cases where models demonstrate generalization and correct predictions in situations where lexical memorization is impossible. 8 Conclusion The application of transfer and multi-task learning in natural language processing has gained sig- nificant traction, yet considerable ambiguity persists regarding the effectiveness of particular task characteristics and experimental setups. This research endeavors to clarify the benefits of TL and MTL in the context of semantic interpretation of noun-noun compounds. By executing a sequence of minimally contrasting experiments and conducting thorough analysis of results and prediction errors, we demonstrate how both TL and MTL can mitigate the effects of class imbalance and drastically enhance predictions for low-frequency relations. Overall, our TL, and particularly our MTL models, are better at making predictions both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, the improvements are observed on the ’most challenging’ inputs that include at least one constituent that was not present in the training data. However, clear indications of ’lexical memorization’ effects are evident in our error analysis of unseen compounds. Typically, the transfer of representations or sharing between tasks is more effective at the embedding layers, which represent the model’s internal representation of the compound constituents. Furthermore, in multi-task learning, the complete sharing of model architecture across tasks degrades its capacity to generalize when it comes to less frequent relations. The dataset provided by Fares (2016) is an appealing resource for new neural approaches to compound interpretation because it links this sub-problem with broad-coverage semantic role labeling or semantic dependency parsing in PCEDT and NomBank. Future research will focus on incorporating additional natural language processing tasks defined using these frameworks to understand noun-noun compound interpretation using TL and MTL. 9",1,,,,
P009.pdf,"The Importance of Written Explanations in Aggregating Crowdsourced Predictions Abstract This study demonstrates that incorporating the written explanations provided by individuals when making predictions enhances the accuracy of aggregated crowd- sourced forecasts. The research shows that while majority and weighted vote methods are effective, the inclusion of written justifications improves forecast accuracy throughout most of a question’s duration, with the exception of its final phase. Furthermore, the study analyzes the attributes that differentiate reliable and unreliable justifications. 1 Introduction The concept of the ""wisdom of the crowd"" posits that combining information from numerous non- expert individuals can produce answers that are as accurate as, or even more accurate than, those provided by a single expert. A classic example of this concept is the observation that the median estimate of an ox’s weight from a large group of fair attendees was remarkably close to the actual weight. While generally supported, the idea is not without its limitations. Historical examples demonstrate instances where crowds behaved irrationally, and even a world chess champion was able to defeat the combined moves of a crowd. In the current era, the advantages of collective intelligence are widely utilized. For example, Wikipedia relies on the contributions of volunteers, and community-driven question-answering platforms have garnered significant attention from the research community. When compiling information from large groups, it is important to determine whether the individual inputs were made independently. If not, factors like group psychology and the influence of persuasive arguments can skew individual judgments, thus negating the positive effects of crowd wisdom. This paper focuses on forecasts concerning questions spanning political, economic, and social domains. Each forecast includes a prediction, estimating the probability of a particular event, and a written justification that explains the reasoning behind the prediction. Forecasts with identical predictions can have justifications of varying strength, which, in turn, affects the perceived reliability of the predictions. For instance, a justification that simply refers to an external source without explanation may appear to rely heavily on the prevailing opinion of the crowd and might be considered weaker than a justification that presents specific, verifiable facts from external resources. To clarify the terminology used: a ""question"" is defined as a statement that seeks information (e.g., ""Will new legislation be implemented before a certain date?""). Questions have a defined start and end date, and the period between these dates constitutes the ""life"" of the question. ""Forecasters"" are individuals who provide a ""forecast,"" which consists of a ""prediction"" and a ""justification."" The prediction is a numerical representation of the likelihood of an event occurring. The justification is the text provided by the forecaster to support their prediction. The central problem addressed in this work is termed ""calling a question,"" which refers to the process of determining a final prediction by aggregating individual forecasts. Two strategies are employed for calling questions each day throughout their life: considering forecasts submitted on the given day (""daily"") and considering the last forecast submitted by each forecaster (""active""). Inspired by prior research on recognizing and fostering skilled forecasters, and analyzing written justifications to assess the quality of individual or collective forecasts, this paper investigates the automated calling of questions throughout their duration based on the forecasts available each day. The primary contributions are empirical findings that address the following research questions: * When making a prediction on a specific day, is it advantageous to include forecasts from previous days? (Yes) * Does the accuracy of the prediction improve when considering the question itself and the written justifications provided with the forecasts? (Yes) * Is it easier to make an accurate prediction toward the end of a question’s duration? (Yes) * Are written justifications more valuable when the crowd’s predictions are less accurate? (Yes) In addition, this research presents an examination of the justifications associated with both accurate and inaccurate forecasts. This analysis aims to identify the features that contribute to a justification being more or less credible. 2 Related Work The language employed by individuals is indicative of various characteristics. Prior research includes both predictive models (using language samples to predict attributes about the author) and models that provide valuable insights (using language samples and author attributes to identify differentiating linguistic features). Previous studies have examined factors such as gender and age, political ideology, health outcomes, and personality traits. In this paper, models are constructed to predict outcomes based on crowd-sourced forecasts without knowledge of individual forecasters’ identities. Previous research has also explored how language use varies depending on the relationships between individuals. For instance, studies have analyzed language patterns in social networks, online commu- nities, and corporate emails to understand how individuals in positions of authority communicate. Similarly, researchers have examined how language provides insights into interpersonal interactions and relationships. In terms of language form and function, prior research has investigated politeness, empathy, advice, condolences, usefulness, and deception. Related to the current study’s focus, researchers have examined the influence of Wikipedia editors and studied influence levels within online communities. Persuasion has also been analyzed from a computational perspective, including within the context of dialogue systems. The work presented here complements these previous studies. The goal is to identify credible justifications to improve the aggregation of crowdsourced forecasts, without explicitly targeting any of the aforementioned characteristics. Within the field of computational linguistics, the task most closely related to this research is argumen- tation. A strong justification for a forecast can be considered a well-reasoned supporting argument. Previous work in this area includes identifying argument components such as claims, premises, backing, rebuttals, and refutations, as well as mining arguments that support or oppose a particular claim. Despite these efforts, it was found that crowdsourced justifications rarely adhere to these established argumentation frameworks, even though such justifications are valuable for aggregating forecasts. Finally, several studies have focused on forecasting using datasets similar or identical to the one used in this research. From a psychological perspective, researchers have explored strategies for enhancing forecasting accuracy, such as utilizing top-performing forecasters (often called ""superforecasters""), and have analyzed the traits that contribute to their success. These studies aim to identify and cultivate superforecasters but do not incorporate the written justifications accompanying forecasts. In contrast, the present research develops models to call questions without using any information about the forecasters themselves. Within the field of computational linguistics, researchers have evaluated the language used in high-quality justifications, focusing on aspects like rating, benefit, and influence. Other researchers have developed models to predict forecaster skill using the textual justifications from specific datasets, such as the Good Judgment Open data, and have also applied these models to predict the accuracy of individual forecasts in other contexts, such as company earnings reports. However, none of these prior works have specifically aimed to call questions throughout their entire duration. 2 3 Dataset The research utilizes data from the Good Judgment Open, a platform where questions are posted, and individuals submit their forecasts. The questions primarily revolve around geopolitics, encompassing areas such as domestic and international politics, the economy, and social matters. For this study, all binary questions were collected, along with their associated forecasts, each comprising a prediction and a justification. In total, the dataset contains 441 questions and 96,664 forecasts submitted over 32,708 days. This dataset significantly expands upon previous research, nearly doubling the number of forecasts analyzed. Since the objective is to accurately call questions throughout their entire duration, all forecasts with written justifications are included, regardless of factors such as justification length or the number of forecasts submitted by a single forecaster. Additionally, this approach prioritizes privacy, as no information about the individual forecasters is utilized. Table 1: Analysis of the questions from our dataset. Most questions are relatively long, contain two or more named entities, and are open for over one month. Metric Min Q1 Q2 (Median) Q3 Max Mean # tokens 8 16 20 28 48 21.94 # entities 0 2 3 5 11 3.47 # verbs 0 2 2 3 6 2.26 # days open 2 24 59 98 475 74.16 Table 1 provides a basic analysis of the questions in the dataset. The majority of questions are relatively lengthy, containing more than 16 tokens and multiple named entities, with geopolitical, person, and date entities being the most frequent. In terms of duration, half of the questions remain open for nearly two months, and 75% are open for more than three weeks. An examination of the topics covered by the questions using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) reveals three primary themes: elections (including terms like ""voting,"" ""winners,"" and ""candidate""), government actions (including terms like ""negotiations,"" ""announcements,"" ""meetings,"" and ""passing (a law)""), and wars and violent crimes (including terms like ""groups,"" ""killing,"" ""civilian (casualties),"" and ""arms""). Although not explicitly represented in the LDA topics, the questions address both domestic and international events within these broad themes. Table 2: Analysis of the 96,664 written justifications submitted by forecasters in our dataset. The readability scores indicate that most justifications are easily understood by high school students (11th or 12th grade), although a substantial amount (>25%) require a college education (Flesch under 50 or Dale-Chall over 9.0).

The median length is relatively short, consisting of one sentence and 23 tokens. Justifications mention named entities less frequently than the questions themselves. Interestingly, half of the justifications contain at least one negation, and 25% include three or more. This suggests that forecasters sometimes base their predictions on events that might not occur or have not yet occurred. The sentiment polarity of 3 the justifications is generally neutral. In terms of readability, both the Flesch and Dale-Chall scores suggest that approximately a quarter of the justifications require a college-level education for full comprehension. Regarding verbs and nouns, an analysis using WordNet lexical files reveals that the most common verb classes are ""change"" (e.g., ""happen,"" ""remain,"" ""increase""), ""social"" (e.g., ""vote,"" ""support,"" ""help""), ""cognition"" (e.g., ""think,"" ""believe,"" ""know""), and ""motion"" (e.g., ""go,"" ""come,"" ""leave""). The most frequent noun classes are ""act"" (e.g., ""election,"" ""support,"" ""deal""), ""communication"" (e.g., ""questions,"" ""forecast,"" ""news""), ""cognition"" (e.g., ""point,"" ""issue,"" ""possibility""), and ""group"" (e.g., ""government,"" ""people,"" ""party""). 4 Experiments and Results Experiments are conducted to address the challenge of accurately calling a question throughout its duration. The input consists of the question itself and the associated forecasts (predictions and justifications), while the output is an aggregated answer to the question derived from all forecasts. The number of instances corresponds to the total number of days all questions were open. Both simple baselines and a neural network are employed, considering both (a) daily forecasts and (b) active forecasts submitted up to ten days prior. The questions are divided into training, validation, and test subsets. Subsequently, all forecasts submitted throughout the duration of each question are assigned to their respective subsets. It’s important to note that randomly splitting the forecasts would be an inappropriate approach. This is because forecasts for the same question submitted on different days would be distributed across the training, validation, and test subsets, leading to data leakage and inaccurate performance evaluation. 4.1 Baselines Two unsupervised baselines are considered. The ""majority vote"" baseline determines the answer to a question based on the most frequent prediction among the forecasts. The ""weighted vote"" baseline, on the other hand, assigns weights to the probabilities in the predictions and then aggregates them. 4.2 Neural Network Architecture A neural network architecture is employed, which consists of three main components: one to generate a representation of the question, another to generate a representation of each forecast, and an LSTM to process the sequence of forecasts and ultimately call the question. The representation of a question is obtained using BERT, followed by a fully connected layer with 256 neurons, ReLU activation, and dropout. The representation of a forecast is created by concatenating three elements: (a) a binary flag indicating whether the forecast was submitted on the day the question is being called or on a previous day, (b) the prediction itself (a numerical value between 0.0 and 1.0), and (c) a representation of the justification. The representation of the justification is also obtained using BERT, followed by a fully connected layer with 256 neurons, ReLU activation, and dropout. The LSTM has a hidden state with a dimensionality of 256 and processes the sequence of forecasts as its input. During the tuning process, it was discovered that providing the representation of the question alongside each forecast is more effective than processing forecasts independently of the question. Consequently, the representation of the question is concatenated with the representation of each forecast before being fed into the LSTM. Finally, the last hidden state of the LSTM is connected to a fully connected layer with a single neuron and sigmoid activation to produce the final prediction for the question. 4.3 Architecture Ablation Experiments are carried out with the complete neural architecture, as described above, as well as with variations where certain components are disabled. Specifically, the representation of a forecast is manipulated by incorporating different combinations of information: 4 * Only the prediction. * The prediction and the representation of the question. * The prediction and the representation of the justification. * The prediction, the representation of the question, and the representation of the justification. 4.4 Quantitative Results The evaluation metric used is accuracy, which represents the average percentage of days a model correctly calls a question throughout its duration. Results are reported for all days combined, as well as for each of the four quartiles of the question’s duration. Table 3: Results with the test questions (Accuracy: average percentage of days a model predicts a question correctly). Results are provided for all days a question was open and for four quartiles (Q1: first 25% of days, Q2: 25-50%, Q3: 50-75%, and Q4: last 25% of days).

However, the full neural network achieves significantly improved results. **Using Daily or Active Forecasts** Incorporating active forecasts, rather than solely relying on forecasts submitted on the day the question is called, proves advantageous for both baselines and all neural network configurations, except for the one using only predictions and justifications. **Encoding Questions and Justifications** The neural network that only utilizes the prediction to represent a forecast surpasses both baseline methods. Notably, integrating the question, the justification, or both into the forecast representation yields further improvements. These results indicate that incorporating the question and forecaster-provided justifications into the model enhances the accuracy of question calling. **Calling Questions Throughout Their Life** When examining the results across the four quartiles of a question’s duration, it’s observed that while using active forecasts is beneficial across all quartiles for both baselines and all network configurations, the neural networks surprisingly outperform the baselines only in the first three quartiles. In the last quartile, the neural networks perform significantly worse than the baselines. This suggests that while modeling questions and justifications is generally helpful, it becomes detrimental toward the end of a question’s life. This phenomenon can be attributed to the increasing wisdom of the crowd as more evidence becomes available and more forecasters contribute, making their aggregated predictions more accurate. 5 Table 4: Results with the test questions, categorized by question difficulty as determined by the best baseline model. The table presents the accuracy (average percentage of days a question is predicted correctly) for all questions and for each quartile of difficulty: Q1 (easiest 25%), Q2 (25-50%), Q3 (50-75%), and Q4 (hardest 25%).

This helps to understand which questions benefit most from the neural networks that incorporate questions and justifications. However, it’s important to note that calculating question difficulty during the question’s active period is not feasible, making these experiments unrealistic before the question closes and the correct answer is revealed. Table 4 presents the results for selected models based on question difficulty. The weighted vote baseline demonstrates superior performance for 75 5 Qualitative Analysis This section provides insights into the factors that make questions more difficult to forecast and examines the characteristics of justifications associated with incorrect and correct predictions. **Questions** An analysis of the 88 questions in the test set revealed that questions called incorrectly on at least one day by the best model tend to have a shorter duration (69.4 days vs. 81.7 days) and a higher number of active forecasts per day (31.0 vs. 26.7). This suggests that the model’s errors align with the questions that forecasters also find challenging. **Justifications** A manual review of 400 justifications (200 associated with incorrect predictions and 200 with correct predictions) was conducted, focusing on those submitted on days when the best model made an incorrect prediction. The following observations were made: * A higher percentage of incorrect predictions (78%) were accompanied by short justifications (fewer than 20 tokens), compared to 65% for correct predictions. This supports the idea that longer user-generated text often indicates higher quality. * References to previous forecasts (either by the same or other forecasters, or the current crowd’s forecast) were more common in justifications for incorrect predictions (31.5%) than for correct predictions (16%). * A lack of a logical argument was prevalent in the justifications, regardless of the prediction’s accuracy. However, it was more frequent in justifications for incorrect predictions (62.5%) than for correct predictions (47.5%). * Surprisingly, justifications with generic arguments did not clearly differentiate between incorrect and correct predictions (16.0% vs. 14.5%). * Poor grammar and spelling or the use of non-English were infrequent but more common in justifications for incorrect predictions (24.5%) compared to correct predictions (14.5%). 6 Conclusions Forecasting involves predicting future events, a capability highly valued by both governments and industries as it enables them to anticipate and address potential challenges. This study focuses on questions spanning the political, economic, and social domains, utilizing forecasts submitted by a crowd of individuals without specialized training. Each forecast comprises a prediction and a natural language justification. 6 The research demonstrates that aggregating the weighted predictions of forecasters is a solid baseline for calling a question throughout its duration. However, models that incorporate both the question and the justifications achieve significantly better results, particularly during the first three quartiles of a question’s life. Importantly, the models developed in this study do not profile individual forecasters or utilize any information about their identities. This work lays the groundwork for evaluating the credibility of anonymous forecasts, enabling the development of robust aggregation strategies that do not require tracking individual forecasters. 7",1,,,,
P010.pdf,"Detecting Medication Usage in Parkinson’s Disease Through Multi-modal Indoor Positioning: A Pilot Study in a Naturalistic Environment Abstract Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to motor symptoms, including gait impairment. The effectiveness of levodopa therapy, a common treatment for PD, can fluctuate, causing periods of improved mobility (""on"" state) and periods where symptoms re-emerge (""off"" state). These fluctuations impact gait speed and increase in severity as the disease progresses. This paper proposes a transformer-based method that uses both Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and accelerometer data from wearable devices to enhance indoor localization accuracy. A secondary goal is to determine if indoor localization, particularly in-home gait speed features (like the time to walk between rooms), can be used to identify motor fluctuations by detecting if a person with PD is taking their levodopa medication or not. The method is evaluated using a real-world dataset collected in a free-living setting, where movements are varied and unstructured. Twenty-four participants, living in pairs (one with PD and one control), resided in a sensor-equipped smart home for five days. The results show that the proposed network surpasses other methods for indoor localization. The evaluation of the secondary goal reveals that accurate room-level localization, when converted into in-home gait speed features, can accurately predict whether a PD participant is taking their medication or not. 1 Introduction Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative condition that affects approximately 6 million individuals globally. It manifests through various motor symptoms, including bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity, and gait impairment. A common complication associated with levodopa, the primary medication for PD, is the emergence of motor fluctuations that are linked to medication timing. Initially, patients experience a consistent and extended therapeutic effect when starting levodopa. However, as the disease advances, a significant portion of patients begin to experience ""wearing off"" of their medication before the next scheduled dose, resulting in the reappearance of parkinsonian symptoms, such as slowed gait. These fluctuations in symptoms negatively impact patients’ quality of life and often necessitate adjustments to their medication regimen. The severity of motor symptoms can escalate to the point where they impede an individual’s ability to walk and move within their own home. Consequently, individuals may be inclined to remain confined to a single room, and when they do move, they may require more time to transition between rooms. These observations could potentially be used to identify periods when PD patients are experiencing motor fluctuations related to their medication being in an ON or OFF state, thereby providing valuable information to both clinicians and patients. A sensitive and accurate ecologically-validated biomarker for PD progression is currently unavailable, which has contributed to failures in clinical trials for neuroprotective therapies in PD. Gait parameters are sensitive to disease progression in unmedicated early-stage PD and show promise as markers of disease progression, making measuring gait parameters potentially useful in clinical trials of disease-modifying interventions. Clinical evaluations of PD are typically conducted in artificial clinic or laboratory settings, which only capture a limited view of an individual’s motor function. Continuous monitoring could capture symptom progression, including motor fluctuations, and sensitively quantify them over time. While PD symptoms, including gait and balance parameters, can be measured continuously at home using wearable devices containing inertial motor units (IMUs) or smartphones, this data does not show the context in which the measurements are taken. Determining a person’s location within a home (indoor localization) could provide valuable contextual information for interpreting PD symptoms. For instance, symptoms like freezing of gait and turning in gait vary depending on the environment, so knowing a person’s location could help predict such symptoms or interpret their severity. Additionally, understanding how much time someone spends alone or with others in a room is a step towards understanding their social participation, which impacts quality of life in PD. Localization could also provide valuable information in the measurement of other behaviors such as non-motor symptoms like urinary function (e.g., how many times someone visits the toilet room overnight). IoT-based platforms with sensors capturing various modalities of data, combined with machine learning, can be used for unobtrusive and continuous indoor localization in home environments. Many of these techniques utilize radio-frequency signals, specifically the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI), emitted by wearables and measured at access points (AP) throughout a home. These signals estimate the user’s position based on perceived signal strength, creating radio-map features for each room. To improve localization accuracy, accelerometer data from wearable devices, along with RSSI, can be used to distinguish different activities (e.g., walking vs. standing). Since some activities are associated with specific rooms (e.g., stirring a pan on the stove is likely to occur in a kitchen), accelerometer data can enhance RSSI’s ability to differentiate between adjacent rooms, an area where RSSI alone may be insufficient. The heterogeneity of PD, where symptoms and their severity vary between patients, poses a challenge for generalizing accelerometer data across different individuals. Severe symptoms, such as tremors, can introduce bias and accumulated errors in accelerometer data, particularly when collected from wrist-worn devices, which are a common and well-accepted placement location. Naively combining accelerometer data with RSSI may degrade indoor localization performance due to varying tremor levels in the acceleration signal. This work makes two primary contributions to address these challenges. (1) We detail the use of RSSI, augmented by accelerometer data, to achieve room-level localization. Our proposed network intelligently selects accelerometer features that can enhance RSSI performance in indoor localization. To rigorously assess our method, we utilize a free-living dataset (where individuals live without external intervention) developed by our group, encompassing diverse and unstructured movements as expected in real-world scenarios. Evaluation on this dataset, including individuals with and without PD, demonstrates that our network outperforms other methods across all cross-validation categories. (2) We demonstrate how accurate room-level localization predictions can be transformed into in-home gait speed biomarkers (e.g., number of room-to-room transitions, room-to-room transition duration). These biomarkers can effectively classify the OFF or ON medication state of a PD patient from this pilot study data. 2 Related Work Extensive research has utilized home-based passive sensing systems to evaluate how the activities and behavior of individuals with neurological conditions, primarily cognitive dysfunction, change over time. However, there is limited work assessing room use in the home setting in people with Parkinson’s. Gait quantification using wearables or smartphones is an area where a significant amount of work has been done. Cameras can also detect parkinsonian gait and some gait features, including step length and average walking speed. Time-of-flight devices, which measure distances between the subject and the camera, have been used to assess medication adherence through gait analysis. From free-living data, one approach to gait and room use evaluation in home settings is by emitting and detecting radio waves to non-invasively track movement. Gait analysis using radio wave technology shows promise to track disease progression, severity, and medication response. However, this approach cannot identify who is doing the movement and also suffers from technical issues when the radio waves are occluded by another object. Much of the work done so far using video to track PD symptoms has focused on the performance of structured clinical rating scales during telemedicine consultations as opposed to naturalistic behavior, and there have been some privacy concerns around the use of video data at home. RSSI data from wearable devices is a type of data with fewer privacy concerns; it can be measured continuously and unobtrusively over long periods to capture real-world function and behavior in a privacy-friendly way. In indoor localization, fingerprinting using RSSI is the typical technique used to estimate the wearable (user) location by using signal strength data representing a coarse and noisy estimate of the distance from the wearable to the access point. RSSI signals are not stable; they fluctuate randomly due to shadowing, fading, and multi-path effects. However, many techniques have been proposed in recent years to tackle these fluctuations and indirectly improve localization accuracy. Some works utilize deep neural networks (DNN) to generate coarse positioning estimates from RSSI signals, which are then refined by a hidden Markov model (HMM) to produce a final location estimate. Other works try to utilize a time series of RSSI data and exploit the temporal connections within each access point to estimate room-level position. A CNN is used to build localization models to further leverage the temporal dependencies across time-series readings. It has been suggested that we cannot rely on RSSI alone for indoor localization in home environments for PD subjects due to shadowing rooms with tight separation. Some researchers combine RSSI signals and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data to test the viability of leveraging other sensors in aiding the positioning system to produce a more accurate location estimate. Classic machine learning approaches such as Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) are tested, and the result shows that the RF outperforms other methods in tracking a person in indoor environments. Others combine smartphone IMU sensor data and Wi-Fi-received signal strength indication (RSSI) measurements to estimate the exact location (in Euclidean position X, Y) of a person in indoor environments. The proposed sensor fusion framework uses location fingerprinting in combination with a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm to reduce positioning errors. Looking at this multi-modality classification/regression problem from a time series perspective, there has been a lot of exploration in tackling a problem where each modality can be categorized as multivariate time series data. LSTM and attention layers are often used in parallel to directly transform raw multivariate time series data into a low-dimensional feature representation for each modality. Later, various processes are done to further extract correlations across modalities through the use of various layers (e.g., concatenation, CNN layer, transformer, self-attention). Our work is inspired by prior research where we only utilize accelerometer 2 data to enrich the RSSI, instead of utilizing all IMU sensors, in order to reduce battery consumption. In addition, unlike previous work that stops at predicting room locations, we go a step further and use room-to-room transition behaviors as features for a binary classifier predicting whether people with PD are taking their medications or withholding them. 3 Cohort and Dataset **Dataset:** This dataset was collected using wristband wearable sensors, one on each wrist of all participants, containing tri-axial accelerometers and 10 Access Points (APs) placed throughout the residential home, each measuring the RSSI. The wearable devices wirelessly transmit data using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard, which can be received by the 10 APs. Each AP records the transmitted packets from the wearable sensor, which contains the accelerometer readings sampled at 30Hz, with each AP recording RSSI values sampled at 5 Hz. The dataset contains 12 spousal/parent-child/friend-friend pairs (24 participants in total) living freely in a smart home for five days. Each pair consists of one person with PD and one healthy control volunteer (HC). This pairing was chosen to enable PD vs. HC comparison, for safety reasons, and also to increase the naturalistic social behavior (particularly amongst the spousal pairs who already lived together). From the 24 participants, five females and seven males have PD. The average age of the participants is 60.25 (PD 61.25, Control 59.25), and the average time since PD diagnosis for the person with PD is 11.3 years (range 0.5-19). To measure the accuracy of the machine learning models, wall-mounted cameras are installed on the ground floor of the house, which capture red-green-blue (RGB) and depth data 2-3 hours daily (during daylight hours at times when participants were at home). The videos were then manually annotated to the nearest millisecond to provide localization labels. Multiple human labelers used software called ELAN to watch up to 4 simultaneously-captured video files at a time. The resulting labeled data recorded the kitchen, hallway, dining room, living room, stairs, and porch. The duration of labeled data recorded by the cameras for PD and HC is 72.84 and 75.31 hours, respectively, which provides a relatively balanced label set for our room-level classification. Finally, to evaluate the ON/OFF medication state, participants with PD were asked to withhold their dopaminergic medications so that they were in the practically-defined OFF medications state for a temporary period of several hours during the study. Withholding medications removes their mitigation on symptoms, leading to mobility deterioration, which can include slowing of gait. **Data pre-processing for indoor localization:** The data from the two wearable sensors worn by each participant were combined at each time point, based on their modality, i.e., twenty RSSI values (corresponding to 10 APs for each of the two wearable sensors) and accelerometry traces in six spatial directions (corresponding to the three spatial directions (x, y, z) for each wearable) were recorded at each time point. The accelerometer data is resampled to 5Hz to synchronize the data with RSSI values. With a 5-second time window and a 5Hz sampling rate, each RSSI data sample has an input of size (25 x 20), and accelerometer data has an input of size (25 x 6). Imputation for missing values, specifically for RSSI data, is applied by replacing the missing values with a value that is not possible normally (i.e., -120dB). Missing values exist in RSSI data whenever the wearable is out of range of an AP. Finally, all time-series measurements by the modalities are normalized. **Data pre-processing for medication state:** Our main focus is for our neural network to continuously produce room predictions, which are then transformed into in-home gait speed features, particularly for persons with PD. We hypothesize that during their OFF medication state, the deterioration in mobility of a person with PD is exhibited by how they transition between rooms. These features include ’Room-to-room Transition Duration’ and the ’Number of Transitions’ between two rooms. ’Number of Transitions’ represents how active PD subjects are within a certain period of time, while ’Room-to-room Transition Duration’ may provide insight into how severe their disease is by the speed with which they navigate their home environment. With the layout of the house where participants stayed, the hallway is used as a hub connecting all other rooms labeled, and ’Room-to-room Transition’ shows the transition duration (in seconds) between two rooms connected by the hallway. The transition between (1) kitchen and living room, (2) kitchen and dining room, and (3) dining room and living room are chosen as the features due to their commonality across all participants. For these features, we limit the transition time duration (i.e., the time spent in the hallway) to 60 seconds to exclude transitions likely to be prolonged and thus may not be representative of the person’s mobility. These in-home gait speed features are produced by an indoor-localization model by feeding RSSI signals and accelerometer data from 12 PD participants from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, which are aggregated into 4-hour windows. From this, each PD participant will have 20 data samples (four data samples for each of the five days), each of which contains six features (three for the mean of room-to-room transition duration and three for the number of room-to-room transitions). There is only one 4-hour window during which the person with PD is OFF medications. These samples are then used to train a binary classifier determining whether a person with PD is ON or OFF their medications. For a baseline comparison to the in-home gait speed features, demographic features which include age, gender, years of PD, and MDS-UPDRS III score (the gold-standard clinical rating scale score used in clinical trials to measure motor disease severity in PD) are chosen. Two MDS-UPDRS III scores are assigned for each PD participant; one is assigned when a person with PD is ON medications, and the other one is assigned when a person with PD is OFF medications. For each in-home gait speed feature data sample, there will be a corresponding demographic feature data sample that is used to train a different binary classifier to predict whether a person with PD is ON or OFF medications. **Ethical approval:** Full approval from the NHS Wales Research Ethics Committee was granted on December 17, 2019, and Health Research Authority and Health and Care Research Wales approval was confirmed on January 14, 2020; the research was 3 conducted in accord with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975; written informed consent was gained from all study participants. In order to protect participant privacy, supporting data is not shared openly. It will be made available to bona fide researchers subject to a data access agreement. 4 Methodologies and Framework We introduce Multihead Dual Convolutional Self Attention (MDCSA), a deep neural network that utilizes dual modalities for indoor localization in home environments. The network addresses two challenges that arise from multimodality and time-series data: (1) Capturing multivariate features and filtering multimodal noises. RSSI signals, which are measured at multiple access points within a home received from wearable communication, have been widely used for indoor localization, typically using a fingerprinting technique that produces a ground truth radio map of a home. Naturally, the wearable also produces acceleration measurements which can be used to identify typical activities performed in a specific room, and thus we can explore if accelerometer data will enrich the RSSI signals, in particular to help distinguish adjacent rooms, which RSSI-only systems typically struggle with. If it will, how can we incorporate these extra features (and modalities) into the existing features for accurate room predictions, particularly in the context of PD where the acceleration signal may be significantly impacted by the disease itself? (2) Modeling local and global temporal dynamics. The true correlations between inputs both intra-modality (i.e., RSSI signal among access points) and inter-modality (i.e., RSSI signal against accelerometer fluctuation) are dynamic. These dynamics can affect one another within a local context (e.g., cyclical patterns) or across long-term relationships. Can we capture local and global relationships across different modalities? The MDCSA architecture addresses the aforementioned challenges through a series of neural network layers, which are described in the following sections. 4.1 Modality Positional Embedding Due to different data dimensionality between RSSI and accelerometer, coupled with the missing temporal information, a linear layer with a positional encoding is added to transform both RSSI and accelerometer data into their respective embeddings. Suppose we have a collection of RSSI signals xr = [xr 1, xr 2, ..., xr T ] ∈RT ×r and accelerometer data xa = [xa 1, xa 2, ..., xa T ] ∈RT ×a within T time units, where xr t = [xr t1, xr t2, ..., xr tr] represents RSSI signals from r access points, and xa t = [xa t1, xa t2, ..., xa ta] represents accelerometer data from a spatial directions at time t with t < T. Given feature vectors xt = [xr t, xa t ] with u ∈{r, a} representing RSSI or accelerometer data at time t, and t < T representing the time index, a positional embedding hu t for RSSI or accelerometer can be obtained by: hu t = (Wuxu t + bu) + τt (1) where Wu ∈Ru×d and bu ∈Rd are the weight and bias to learn, d is the embedding dimension, and τt ∈Rd is the corresponding position encoding at time t. 4.2 Locality Enhancement with Self-Attention Since it is time-series data, the importance of an RSSI or accelerometer value at each point in time can be identified in relation to its surrounding values - such as cyclical patterns, trends, or fluctuations. Utilizing historical context that can capture local patterns on top of point-wise values, performance improvements in attention-based architectures can be achieved. One straightforward option is to utilize a recurrent neural network such as a long-short term memory (LSTM) approach. However, in LSTM layers, the local context is summarized based on the previous context and the current input. Two similar patterns separated by a long period of time might have different contexts if they are processed by the LSTM layers. We utilize a combination of causal convolution layers and self-attention layers, which we name Dual Convolutional Self-Attention (DCSA). The DCSA takes in a primary input ˆx1 ∈RN×d and a secondary input ˆx2 ∈RN×d and yields: DCSA(ˆx1, ˆx2) = GRN(Norm(ϕ(ˆx1) + ˆx1), Norm(ϕ(ˆx2) + ˆx2)) (2) with ϕ(ˆx) = SA(Φk(ˆx)WQ, Φk(ˆx)WK, Φk(ˆx)WV ) (3) where GRN(.) is the Gated Residual Network to integrate dual inputs into one integrated embedding, Norm(.) is a standard layer normalization, SA(.) is a scaled dot-product self-attention, Φk(.) is a 1D-convolutional layer with a kernel size {1, k} and a stride of 1, WK ∈Rd×d, WQ ∈Rd×d, WV ∈Rd×d are weights for keys, queries, and values of the self-attention layer, and d is the embedding dimension. Note that all weights for GRN are shared across each time step t. 4 4.3 Multihead Dual Convolutional Self-Attention Our approach employs a self-attention mechanism to capture global dependencies across time steps. It is embedded as part of the DCSA architecture. Inspired by utilizing multihead self-attention, we utilize our DCSA with various kernel lengths with the same aim: allowing asymmetric long-term learning. The multihead DCSA takes in two inputs ˆx1, ˆx2 ∈RN×d and yields: MDCSAk1,...,kn(ˆx1, ˆx2) = Ξn(ϕk1,...,kn(ˆx1, ˆx2)) (4) with ϕki(ˆx1, ˆx2) = SA(Φki(ˆx1)WQ, Φki(ˆx2)WK, Φki(ˆx1, ˆx2)WV ) (5) where Φki(.) is a 1D-convolutional layer with a kernel size {1, ki} and a stride ki, WK ∈Rd×d, WQ ∈Rd×d, WV ∈Rd×d are weights for keys, queries, and values of the self-attention layer, and Ξn(.) concatenates the output of each DCSAki(.) in temporal order. For regularization, a normalization layer followed by a dropout layer is added after Equation 4. Following the modality positional embedding layer in subsection 4.1, the positional embeddings of RSSI hr = [hr 1, ..., hr T ] and accelerometer ha = [ha 1, ..., ha T ], produced by Eq. 1, are then fed to an MDCSA layer with various kernel sizes [k1, ..., kn]: h = MDCSAk1,...,kn(hr, ha) (6) to yield h = [h1, ..., hT ] with ht ∈Rd and t < T. 4.4 Final Layer and Loss Calculation We apply two different layers to produce two different outputs during training. The room-level predictions are produced via a single conditional random field (CRF) layer in combination with a linear layer applied to the output of Eq. 7 to produce the final predictions as: ˆyt = CRF(ϕ(ht)) (7) q′(ht) = Wpht + bp (8) where Wp ∈Rd×m and bp ∈Rm are the weight and bias to learn, m is the number of room locations, and h = [h1, ..., hT ] ∈RT ×d is the refined embedding produced by Eq. 7. Even though the transformer can take into account neighbor information before generating the refined embedding at time step t, its decision is independent; it does not take into account the actual decision made by other refined embeddings t. We use a CRF layer to cover just that, i.e., to maximize the probability of the refined embeddings of all time steps, so it can better model cases where refined embeddings closest to one another must be compatible (i.e., minimizing the possibility for impossible room transitions). When finding the best sequence of room location ˆyt, the Viterbi Algorithm is used as a standard for the CRF layer. For the second layer, we choose a particular room as a reference and perform a binary classification at each time step t. The binary classification is produced via a linear layer applied to the refined embedding ht as: ˆft = Wfht + bf (9) where Wf ∈Rd×1 and bf ∈R are the weight and bias to learn, and ˆf = [ ˆf1, ..., ˆfT ] ∈RT is the target probabilities for the referenced room within time window T. The reason to perform a binary classification against a particular room is because of our interest in improving the accuracy in predicting that room. In our application, the room of our choice is the hallway, where it will be used as a hub connecting any other room. **Loss Functions:** During the training process, the MDCSA network produces two kinds of outputs. Emission outputs (outputs produced by Equation 9 prior to prediction outputs) ˆe = [ϕ(h1), ..., ϕ(hT )] are trained to generate the likelihood estimate of room predictions, while the binary classification output ˆf = [ ˆf1, ..., ˆfT ] is used to train the probability estimate of a particular room. The final loss function can be formulated as a combination of both likelihood and binary cross-entropy loss functions described as: L(ˆe, y, ˆf, f) = LLL(ˆe, y) + T X t=1 LBCE( ˆft, ft) (10) LLL(ˆe, y) = T X i=0 P(ϕ(hi))qT i (yi|yi−1) − T X i=0 P(ϕ(hi))[qT i (yi|yi−1)] (11) 5 LBCE( ˆf, f) = −1 T T X t=0 ft log( ˆft) + (1 −ft) log(1 −ˆft) (12) where LLL(.) represents the negative log-likelihood and LBCE(.) denotes the binary cross-entropy, y = [y1, ..., yT ] ∈RT is the actual room locations, and f = [f1, ..., fT ] ∈RT is the binary value whether at time t the room is the referenced room or not. P(yi|yi−1) denotes the conditional probability, and P(yt|yt−1) denotes the transition matrix cost of having transitioned from yt−1 to yt. 5 Experiments and Results We compare our proposed network, MDCSA1,4,7 (MDCSA with 3 kernels of size 1, 4, and 7), with: - Random Forest (RF) as a baseline technique, which has been shown to work well for indoor localization. - A modified transformer encoder in combination with a CRF layer representing a model with the capability to capture global dependency and enforce dependencies in temporal aspects. - A state-of-the-art model for multimodal and multivariate time series with a transformer encoder to learn asymmetric correlations across modalities. - An alternative to the previous model, representing it with a GRN layer replacing the context aggregation layer and a CRF layer added as the last layer. - MDCSA1,4,7 4APS, as an ablation study, with our proposed network (i.e., MDCSA1,4,7) using 4 access points for the RSSI (instead of 10 access points) and accelerometer data (ACCL) as its input features. - MDCSA1,4,7 RSSI, as an ablation study, with our proposed network using only RSSI, without ACCL, as its input features. - MDCSA1,4,7 4APS RSSI, as an ablation study, with our proposed network using only 4 access points for the RSSI as its input features. For RF, all the time series features of RSSI and accelerometry are flattened and merged into one feature vector for room-level localization. For the modified transformer encoder, at each time step t, RSSI xr t and accelerometer xa t features are combined via a linear layer before they are processed by the networks. A grid search on the parameters of each network is performed to find the best parameter for each model. The parameters to tune are the embedding dimension d in 128, 256, the number of epochs in 200, 300, and the learning rate in 0.01, 0.0001. The dropout rate is set to 0.15, and a specific optimizer in combination with a Look-Ahead algorithm is used for the training with early stopping using the validation performance. For the RF, we perform a cross-validated parameter search for the number of trees (200, 250), the minimum number of samples in a leaf node (1, 5), and whether a warm start is needed. The Gini impurity is used to measure splits. **Evaluation Metrics:** We are interested in developing a system to monitor PD motor symptoms in home environments. For example, we will consider if there is any significant difference in the performance of the system when it is trained with PD data compared to being trained with healthy control (HC) data. We tailored our training procedure to test our hypothesis by performing variations of cross-validation. Apart from training our models on all HC subjects (ALL-HC), we also perform four different kinds of cross-validation: 1) We train our models on one PD subject (LOO-PD), 2) We train our models on one HC subject (LOO-HC), 3) We take one HC subject and use only roughly four minutes’ worth of data to train our models (4m-HC), 4) We take one PD subject and use only roughly four minutes’ worth of data to train our models (4m-PD). For all of our experiments, we test our trained models on all PD subjects (excluding the one used as training data for LOO-PD and 4m-PD). For room-level localization accuracy, we use precision and weighted F1-score, all averaged and standard deviated across the test folds. To showcase the importance of in-home gait speed features in differentiating the medication state of a person with PD, we first compare how accurate the ’Room-to-room Transition’ duration produced by each network is to the ground truth (i.e., annotated location). We hypothesize that the more accurate the transition is compared to the ground truth, the better mobility features are for medication state classification. For the medication state classification, we then compare two different groups of features with two simple binary classifiers: 1) the baseline demographic features (see Section 3), and 2) the normalized in-home gait speed features. The metric we use for ON/OFF medication state evaluation is the weighted F1-Score and AUROC, which are averaged and standard deviated across the test folds. 5.1 Experimental Results **Room-level Accuracy:** The first part of Table 1 compares the performance of the MDCSA network and other approaches for room-level classification. For room-level classification, the MDCSA network outperforms other networks and RF with a minimum improvement of 1.3% for the F1-score over the second-best network in each cross-validation type, with the exception of the ALL-HC validation. The improvement is more significant in the 4m-HC and 4m-PD validations, when the training data are limited, with an average improvement of almost 9% for the F1-score over the alternative to the state-of-the-art model. The LOO-HC and LOO-PD validations show that a model that has the ability to capture the temporal dynamics across time steps will perform better than a standard baseline technique such as a Random Forest. The modified transformer encoder and the state-of-the-art model perform better in those two validations due to their ability to capture asynchronous relations across modalities. However, when the training data becomes limited, as in 4m-HC and 4m-PD validations, having extra capabilities is necessary to further extract temporal information and correlations. Due to being a vanilla transformer requiring a considerable amount of training data, the modified transformer encoder performs worst in these two validations. The state-of-the-art model performs quite well 6 due to its ability to capture local context via LSTM for each modality. However, in general, its performance suffers in both t",,,,,

P011.pdf,"Addressing Popularity Bias with Popularity-Conscious Alignment and Contrastive Learning Abstract Collaborative Filtering (CF) often encounters substantial difficulties with popularity bias because of the skewed distribution of items in real-world datasets. This tendency creates a notable difference in accuracy between items that are popular and those that are not. This discrepancy impedes the accurate comprehension of user preferences and intensifies the Matthew effect within recommendation systems. To counter popularity bias, current methods concentrate on highlighting less popular items or on differentiating the correlation between item representations and their popularity. Despite their effectiveness, current approaches continue to grapple with two significant issues: firstly, the extraction of shared supervisory signals from popular items to enhance the representations of less popular items, and secondly, the reduction of representation separation caused by popularity bias. In this study, we present an empirical examination of popularity bias and introduce a method called Popularity-Aware Alignment and Contrast (PAAC) to tackle these two problems. Specifically, we utilize the common supervisory signals found in popular item representations and introduce an innovative popularity-aware supervised alignment module to improve the learning of representations for unpopular items. Furthermore, we propose adjusting the weights in the contrastive learning loss to decrease the separation of representations by focusing on popularity. We confirm the efficacy and logic of PAAC in reducing popularity bias through thorough experiments on three real-world datasets. 1 Introduction Contemporary recommender systems are essential in reducing information overload. Personalized recommendations frequently employ collaborative filtering (CF) to assist users in discovering items that may interest them. CF-based techniques primarily learn user preferences and item attributes by matching the representations of users with the items they engage with. Despite their achievements, CF-based methods frequently encounter the issue of popularity bias, which leads to considerable disparities in accuracy between items that are popular and those that are not. Popularity bias occurs because there are limited supervisory signals for items that are not popular, which results in overfitting during the training phase and decreased effectiveness on the test set. This hinders the precise comprehension of user preferences, thereby diminishing the variety of recommendations. Furthermore, popularity bias can worsen the Matthew effect, where items that are already popular gain even more popularity because they are recommended more frequently. Two significant challenges are presented when mitigating popularity bias in recommendation systems. The first challenge is the inadequate representation of unpopular items during training, which results in overfitting and limited generalization ability. The second challenge, known as representation separation, happens when popular and unpopular items are categorized into distinct semantic spaces, thereby intensifying the bias and diminishing the precision of recommendations. 2 Methodology To overcome the current difficulties in reducing popularity bias, we introduce the Popularity-Aware Alignment and Contrast (PAAC) method. We utilize the common supervisory signals present in popular item representations to direct the learning of unpopular representations, and we present a popularity-aware supervised alignment module. Moreover, we incorporate a re-weighting system in the contrastive learning module to deal with representation separation by considering popularity. 2.1 Supervised Alignment Module During the training process, the alignment of representations usually emphasizes users and items that have interacted, often causing items to be closer to interacted users than non-interacted ones in the representation space. However, because unpopular items have limited interactions, they are usually modeled based on a small group of users. This limited focus can result in overfitting, as the representations of unpopular items might not fully capture their features. The disparity in the quantity of supervisory signals is essential for learning representations of both popular and unpopular items. Specifically, popular items gain from a wealth of supervisory signals during the alignment process, which helps in effectively learning their representations. On the other hand, unpopular items, which have a limited number of users providing supervision, are more susceptible to overfitting. This is because there is insufficient representation learning for unpopular items, emphasizing the effect of supervisory signal distribution on the quality of representation. Intuitively, items interacted with by the same user have some similar characteristics. In this section, we utilize common supervisory signals in popular item representations and suggest a popularity-aware supervised alignment method to improve the representations of unpopular items. We initially filter items with similar characteristics based on the user’s interests. For any user, we define the set of items they interact with. We count the frequency of each item appearing in the training dataset as its popularity. Subsequently, we group items based on their relative popularity. We divide items into two groups: the popular item group and the unpopular item group. The popularity of each item in the popular group is higher than that of any item in the unpopular group. This indicates that popular items receive more supervisory information than unpopular items, resulting in poorer recommendation performance for unpopular items. To tackle the issue of insufficient representation learning for unpopular items, we utilize the concept that items interacted with by the same user share some similar characteristics. Specifically, we use similar supervisory signals in popular item representations to improve the representations of unpopular items. We align the representations of items to provide more supervisory information to unpopular items and improve their representation, as follows: LSA = X u∈U 1 |Iu| X i∈Iu pop,j∈Iu unpop ||f(i) −f(j)||2, (1) where f(·) is a recommendation encoder and hi = f(i). By efficiently using the inherent information in the data, we provide more supervisory signals for unpopular items without introducing additional side information. This module enhances the representation of unpopular items, mitigating the overfitting issue. 2.2 Re-weighting Contrast Module Recent research has indicated that popularity bias frequently leads to a noticeable separation in the representation of item embeddings. Although methods based on contrastive learning aim to enhance overall uniformity by distancing negative samples, their current sampling methods might unintentionally worsen this separation. When negative samples follow the popularity distribution, which is dominated by popular items, prioritizing unpopular items as positive samples widens the gap between popular and unpopular items in the representation space. Conversely, when negative samples follow a uniform distribution, focusing on popular items separates them from most unpopular ones, thus worsening the representation gap. Existing studies use the same weights for positive and negative samples in the contrastive loss function, without considering differences in item popularity. However, in real-world recommendation datasets, the impact of items varies due to dataset characteristics and interaction distributions. Neglecting this aspect could lead to suboptimal results and exacerbate representation separation. We propose to identify different influences by re-weighting different popularity items. To this end, we introduce re-weighting different positive and negative samples to mitigate representation separation from a popularity-centric perspective. We incorporate this approach into contrastive learning to better optimize the consistency of representations. Specifically, we aim to reduce the risk of pushing items with varying popularity further apart. For example, when using a popular item as a positive sample, our goal is to avoid pushing unpopular items too far away. Thus, we introduce two hyperparameters to control the weights when items are considered positive and negative samples. To ensure balanced and equitable representations of items within our model, we first propose a dynamic strategy to categorize items into popular and unpopular groups for each mini-batch. Instead of relying on a fixed global threshold, which often leads to the overrepresentation of popular items across various batches, we implement a hyperparameter x. This hyperparameter readjusts the classification of items within the current batch. By adjusting the hyperparameter x, we maintain a balance between different item popularity levels. This enhances the model’s ability to generalize across diverse item sets by accurately reflecting the popularity distribution in the current training context. Specifically, we denote the set of items within each batch as IB. And then we divide IB into a popular group Ipop and an unpopular group Iunpop based on their respective popularity levels, classifying the top x% of items as Ipop: IB = Ipop ∪Iunpop, ∀i ∈Ipop ∧j ∈Iunpop, p(i) > p(j), (2) where Ipop ∈IB and Iunpop ∈IB are disjoint, with Ipop consisting of the top x% of items in the batch. In this work, we dynamically divided items into popular and unpopular groups within each mini-batch based on their popularity, assigning the top 50% as popular items and the bottom 50% as unpopular items. This radio not only ensures equal representation of both groups in our contrastive learning but also allows items to be classified adaptively based on the batch’s current composition. After that, we use InfoNCE to optimize the uniformity of item representations. Unlike traditional CL-based methods, we calculate the loss for different item groups. Specifically, we introduce the hyperparameter α to control the positive sample weights between popular and unpopular items, adapting to varying item distributions in different datasets: 2 LCL item = α × LCL pop + (1 −α) × LCL unpop, (3) where LCL pop represents the contrastive loss when popular items are considered as positive samples, and LCL unpop represents the contrastive loss when unpopular items are considered as positive samples. The value of α ranges from 0 to 1, where α = 0 means exclusive emphasis on the loss of unpopular items LCL unpop, and α = 1 means exclusive emphasis on the loss of popular items LCL pop. By adjusting α, we can effectively balance the impact of positive samples from both popular and unpopular items, allowing adaptability to varying item distributions in different datasets. Following this, we fine-tune the weighting of negative samples in the contrastive learning framework using the hyperparameter β. This parameter controls how samples from different popularity groups contribute as negative samples. Specifically, we prioritize re-weighting items with popularity opposite to the positive samples, mitigating the risk of excessively pushing negative samples away and reducing representation separation. Simultaneously, this approach ensures the optimization of intra-group consistency. For instance, when dealing with popular items as positive samples, we separately calculate the impact of popular and unpopular items as negative samples. The hyperparameter β is then used to control the degree to which unpopular items are pushed away. This is formalized as follows: L ′ pop = X i∈Ipop log exp(h ′ ihi/τ) P j∈Ipop exp(h ′ ihj/τ) + β P j∈Iunpop exp(h ′ ihj/τ), (4) similarly, the contrastive loss for unpopular items is defined as: L ′ unpop = X i∈Iunpop log exp(h ′ ihi/τ) P j∈Iunpop exp(h ′ ihj/τ) + β P j∈Ipop exp(h ′ ihj/τ), (5) where the parameter β ranges from 0 to 1, controlling the negative sample weighting in the contrastive loss. When β = 0, it means that only intra-group uniformity optimization is performed. Conversely, when β = 1, it means equal treatment of both popular and unpopular items in terms of their impact on positive samples. The setting of β allows for a flexible adjustment between prioritizing intra-group uniformity and considering the impact of different popularity levels in the training. We prefer to push away items within the same group to optimize uniformity. This setup helps prevent over-optimizing the uniformity of different groups, thereby mitigating representation separation. The final re-weighting contrastive objective is the weighted sum of the user objective and the item objective: LCL = 1 2 × (LCL item + LCL user). (6) In this way, we not only achieved consistency in representation but also reduced the risk of further separating items with similar characteristics into different representation spaces, thereby alleviating the issue of representation separation caused by popularity bias. 2.3 Model Optimization To reduce popularity bias in collaborative filtering tasks, we employ a multi-task training strategy to jointly optimize the classic recommendation loss (LREC), supervised alignment loss (LSA), and re-weighting contrast loss (LCL). L = LREC + λ1LSA + λ2LCL + λ3||Θ||2, (7) where Θ is the set of model parameters in LREC as we do not introduce additional parameters, λ1 and λ2 are hyperparameters that control the strengths of the popularity-aware supervised alignment loss and the re-weighting contrastive learning loss respectively, and λ3 is the L2 regularization coefficient. After completing the model training process, we use the dot product to predict unknown preferences for recommendations. 3 Experiments In this section, we assess the efficacy of PAAC through comprehensive experiments, aiming to address the following research questions: • How does PAAC compare to existing debiasing methods? • How do different designed components play roles in our proposed PAAC? 3 • How does PAAC alleviate the popularity bias? • How do different hyper-parameters affect the PAAC recommendation performance? 3.1 Experiments Settings 3.1.1 Datasets In our experiments, we use three widely public datasets: Amazon-book, Yelp2018, and Gowalla. We retained users and items with a minimum of 10 interactions. 3.1.2 Baselines and Evaluation Metrics We implement the state-of-the-art LightGCN to instantiate PAAC, aiming to investigate how it alleviates popularity bias. We compare PAAC with several debiased baselines, including re-weighting-based models, decorrelation-based models, and contrastive learning-based models. We utilize three widely used metrics, namely Recall@K, HR@K, and NDCG@K, to evaluate the performance of Top-K recommen- dation. Recall@K and HR@K assess the number of target items retrieved in the recommendation results, emphasizing coverage. In contrast, NDCG@K evaluates the positions of target items in the ranking list, with a focus on their positions in the list. We use the full ranking strategy, considering all non-interacted items as candidate items to avoid selection bias during the test stage. We repeated each experiment five times with different random seeds and reported the average scores. 3.2 Overall Performance As shown in Table 1, we compare our model with several baselines across three datasets. The best performance for each metric is highlighted in bold, while the second best is underlined. Our model consistently outperforms all compared methods across all metrics in every dataset. • Our proposed model PAAC consistently outperforms all baselines and significantly mitigates the popularity bias. Specif- ically, PAAC enhances LightGCN, achieving improvements of 282.65%, 180.79%, and 82.89% in NDCG@20 on the Yelp2018, Gowalla, and Amazon-Book datasets, respectively. Compared to the strongest baselines, PAAC delivers better performance. The most significant improvements are observed on Yelp2018, where our model achieves an 8.70% increase in Recall@20, a 10.81% increase in HR@20, and a 30.2% increase in NDCG@20. This improvement can be attributed to our use of popularity-aware supervised alignment to enhance the representation of less popular items and re-weighted contrastive learning to address representation separation from a popularity-centric perspective. • The performance improvements of PAAC are smaller on sparser datasets. For example, on the Gowalla dataset, the improvements in Recall@20, HR@20, and NDCG@20 are 3.18%, 5.85%, and 5.47%, respectively. This may be because, in sparser datasets like Gowalla, even popular items are not well-represented due to lower data density. Aligning unpopular items with these poorly represented popular items can introduce noise into the model. Therefore, the benefits of using supervisory signals for unpopular items may be reduced in very sparse environments, leading to smaller performance improvements. • Regarding the baselines for mitigating popularity bias, the improvement of some is relatively limited compared to the backbone model (LightGCN) and even performs worse in some cases. This may be because some are specifically designed for traditional data-splitting scenarios, where the test set still follows a long-tail distribution, leading to poor generalization. Some mitigate popularity bias by excluding item popularity information. Others use invariant learning to remove popularity information at the representation level, generally performing better than the formers. This shows the importance of addressing popularity bias at the representation level. Some outperform the other baselines, emphasizing the necessary to improve item representation consistency for mitigating popularity bias. • Different metrics across various datasets show varying improvements in model performance. This suggests that different debiasing methods may need distinct optimization strategies for models. Additionally, we observe varying effects of PAAC across different datasets. This difference could be due to the sparser nature of the Gowalla dataset. Conversely, our model can directly provide supervisory signals for unpopular items and conduct intra-group optimization, consistently maintaining optimal performance across all metrics on the three datasets. 3.3 Ablation Study To better understand the effectiveness of each component in PAAC, we conduct ablation studies on three datasets. Table 2 presents a comparison between PAAC and its variants on recommendation performance. Specifically, PAAC-w/o P refers to the variant where the re-weighting contrastive loss of popular items is removed, focusing instead on optimizing the consistency of representations for unpopular items. Similarly, PAAC-w/o U denotes the removal of the re-weighting contrastive loss for unpopular items. PAAC-w/o A refers to the variant without the popularity-aware supervised alignment loss. It’s worth noting that PAAC-w/o A differs from 4 Table 1: Performance comparison on three public datasets with K = 20. The best performance is indicated in bold, while the second-best performance is underlined. The superscripts * indicate p ≤0.05 for the paired t-test of PAAC vs. the best baseline (the relative improvements are denoted as Imp.). !

This approach allows us to separately address the consistency of popular and unpopular item representations, thereby providing a more detailed analysis of the impact of each component on the overall performance. From Table 2, we observe that PAAC-w/o A outperforms SimGCL in most cases. This validates that re-weighting the importance of popular and unpopular items can effectively improve the model’s performance in alleviating popularity bias. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of using supervision signals from popular items to enhance the representations of unpopular items, providing more opportunities for future research on mitigating popularity bias. Moreover, compared with PAAC-w/o U, PAAC-w/o P results in much worse performance. This confirms the importance of re-weighting popular items in contrastive learning for mitigating popularity bias. Finally, PAAC consistently outperforms the three variants, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining supervised alignment and re-weighting contrastive learning. Based on the above analysis, we conclude that leveraging supervisory signals from popular item representations can better optimize representations for unpopular items, and re-weighting contrastive learning allows the model to focus on more informative or critical samples, thereby improving overall performance. All the proposed modules significantly contribute to alleviating popularity bias. Table 2: Ablation study of PAAC, highlighting the best-performing model on each dataset and metrics in bold. Specifically, PAAC-w/o P removes the re-weighting contrastive loss of popular items, PAAC-w/o U eliminates the re-weighting contrastive loss of unpopular items, and PAAC-w/o A omits the popularity-aware supervised alignment loss. !

Specifically, 20% of the most popular items are labeled ’Popular’, and the rest are labeled ’Unpopular’. We compare the performance of PAAC with LightGCN, IPS, MACR, and SimGCL using the NDCG@20 metric across different popularity groups. We use ∆to denote the accuracy gap between the two groups. We draw the following conclusions: • Improving the performance of unpopular items is crucial for enhancing overall model performance. Specially, on the Yelp2018 dataset, PAAC shows reduced accuracy in recommending popular items, with a notable decrease of 20.14% compared to SimGCL. However, despite this decrease, the overall recommendation accuracy surpasses that of SimGCL by 11.94%, primarily due to a 6.81% improvement in recommending unpopular items. This improvement highlights the importance of better recommendations for unpopular items and emphasizes their crucial role in enhancing overall model performance. 5 • Our proposed PAAC significantly enhances the recommendation performance for unpopular items. Specifically, we observe an improvement of 8.94% and 7.30% in NDCG@20 relative to SimGCL on the Gowalla and Yelp2018 datasets, respectively. This improvement is due to the popularity-aware alignment method, which uses supervisory signals from popular items to improve the representations of unpopular items. • PAAC has successfully narrowed the accuracy gap between different item groups. Specifically, PAAC achieved the smallest gap, reducing the NDCG@20 accuracy gap by 34.18% and 87.50% on the Gowalla and Yelp2018 datasets, respectively. This indicates that our method treats items from different groups fairly, effectively alleviating the impact of popularity bias. This success can be attributed to our re-weighted contrast module, which addresses representation separation from a popularity-centric perspective, resulting in more consistent recommendation results across different groups. 3.5 Hyperparameter Sensitivities In this section, we analyze the impact of hyperparameters in PAAC. Firstly, we investigate the influence of λ1 and λ2, which respectively control the impact of the popularity-aware supervised alignment and re-weighting contrast loss. Additionally, in the re-weighting contrastive loss, we introduce two hyperparameters, α and β, to control the re-weighting of different popularity items as positive and negative samples. Finally, we explore the impact of the grouping ratio x on the model’s performance. 3.5.1 Effect of λ1 and λ2 As formulated in Eq. (11), λ1 controls the extent of providing additional supervisory signals for unpopular items, while λ2 controls the extent of optimizing representation consistency. Horizontally, with the increase in λ2, the performance initially increases and then decreases. This indicates that appropriate re-weighting contrastive loss effectively enhances the consistency of representation distributions, mitigating popularity bias. However, overly strong contrastive loss may lead the model to neglect recommendation accuracy. Vertically, as λ1 increases, the performance also initially increases and then decreases. This suggests that suitable alignment can provide beneficial supervisory signals for unpopular items, while too strong an alignment may introduce more noise from popular items to unpopular ones, thereby impacting recommendation performance. 3.5.2 Effect of re-weighting coefficient α and β To mitigate representation separation due to imbalanced positive and negative sampling, we introduce two hyperparameters into the contrastive loss. Specifically, α controls the weight difference between positive samples from popular and unpopular items, while β controls the influence of different popularity items as negative samples. In our experiments, while keeping other hyperparameters constant, we search α and β within the range {0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1}. As α and β increase, performance initially improves and then declines. The optimal hyperparameters for the Yelp2018 and Gowalla datasets are α = 0.8, β = 0.6 and α = 0.2, β = 0.2, respectively. This may be attributed to the characteristics of the datasets. The Yelp2018 dataset, with a higher average interaction frequency per item, benefits more from a higher weight α for popular items as positive samples. Conversely, the Gowalla dataset, being relatively sparse, prefers a smaller α. This indicates the importance of considering dataset characteristics when adjusting the contributions of popular and unpopular items to the model. Notably, α and β are not highly sensitive within the range [0, 1], performing well across a broad spectrum. Performance exceeds the baseline regardless of β values when other parameters are optimal. Additionally, α values from [0.4, 1.0] on the Yelp2018 dataset and [0.2, 0.8] on the Gowalla dataset surpass the baseline, indicating less need for precise tuning. Thus, α and β achieve optimal performance without meticulous adjustments, focusing on weight coefficients to maintain model efficacy. 3.5.3 Effect of grouping ratio x To investigate the impact of different grouping ratios on recommendation performance, we developed a flexible classification method for items within each mini-batch based on their popularity. Instead of adopting a fixed global threshold, which tends to overrepresent popular items in some mini-batches, our approach dynamically divides items in each mini-batch into popular and unpopular categories. Specifically, the top x% of items are classified as popular and the remaining (100 - x)% as unpopular, with x varying. This strategy prevents the overrepresentation typical in fixed distribution models, which could skew the learning process and degrade performance. To quantify the effects of these varying ratios, we examined various division ratios for popular items, including 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%, as shown in Table 3. The preliminary results indicate that both extremely low and high ratios negatively affect model performance, thereby underscoring the superiority of our dynamic data partitioning approach. Moreover, within the 40%-60% range, our model’s performance remained consistently robust, further validating the effectiveness of PAAC. 6 Table 3: Performance comparison across varying popular item ratios x on metrics. !

Numerous techniques have been suggested to examine and decrease performance variations between popular and unpopular items. These techniques can be broadly divided into three categories. • Re-weighting-based methods aim to increase the training weight or scores for unpopular items, redirecting focus away from popular items during training or prediction. For instance, IPS adds compensation to unpopular items and adjusts the prediction of the user-item preference matrix, resulting in higher preference scores and improving rankings for unpopular items. α-AdjNorm enhances the focus on unpopular items by controlling the normalization strength during the neighborhood aggregation process in GCN-based models. • Decorrelation-based methods aim to effectively remove the correlations between item representations (or prediction scores) and popularity. For instance, MACR uses counterfactual reasoning to eliminate the direct impact of popularity on item outcomes. In contrast, InvCF operates on the principle that item representations remain invariant to changes in popularity semantics, filtering out unstable or outdated popularity characteristics to learn unbiased representations. • Contrastive-learning-based methods aim to achieve overall uniformity in item representations using InfoNCE, preserving more inherent characteristics of items to mitigate popularity bias. This approach has been demonstrated as a state-of-the-art method for alleviating popularity bias. It employs data augmentation techniques such as graph augmentation or feature augmentation to generate different views, maximizing positive pair consistency and minimizing negative pair consistency to promote more uniform representations. Specifically, Adap-τ adjusts user/item embeddings to specific values, while SimGCL integrates InfoNCE loss to enhance representation uniformity and alleviate popularity bias. 4.2 Representation Learning for CF Representation learning is crucial in recommendation systems, especially in modern collaborative filtering (CF) techniques. It creates personalized embeddings that capture user preferences and item characteristics. The quality of these representations critically determines a recommender system’s effectiveness by precisely capturing the interplay between user interests and item features. Recent studies emphasize two fundamental principles in representation learning: alignment and uniformity. The alignment principle ensures that embeddings of similar or related items (or users) are closely clustered together, improving the system’s ability to recommend items that align with a user’s interests. This principle is crucial when accurately reflecting user preferences through corresponding item characteristics. Conversely, the uniformity principle ensures a balanced distribution of all embeddings across the representation space. This approach prevents the over-concentration of embeddings in specific areas, enhancing recommendation diversity and improving generalization to unseen data. In this work, we focus on aligning the representations of popular and unpopular items interacted with by the same user and re- weight",,,,,

P012.pdf,"Safe Predictors for Input-Output Specification Enforcement Abstract This paper presents an approach for designing neural networks, along with other machine learning models, which adhere to a collection of input-output specifica- tions. Our method involves the construction of a constrained predictor for each set of compatible constraints, and combining these predictors in a safe manner using a convex combination of their predictions. We demonstrate the applicability of this method with synthetic datasets and on an aircraft collision avoidance problem. 1 Introduction The increasing adoption of machine learning models, such as neural networks, in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous vehicles and aircraft collision avoidance, highlights an urgent need for the development of guarantees on safety and robustness. These models may be required to satisfy specific input-output specifications to ensure the algorithms comply with physical laws, can be executed safely, and are consistent with prior domain knowledge. Furthermore, these models should demonstrate adversarial robustness, meaning their outputs should not change abruptly within small input regions – a property that neural networks often fail to satisfy. Recent studies have shown the capacity to verify formally input-output specifications and adversarial robustness properties of neural networks. For instance, the Satisability Modulo Theory (SMT) solver Reluplex was employed to verify properties of networks being used in the Next-Generation Aircraft Collision Avoidance System for Unmanned aircraft (ACAS Xu). Reluplex has also been used to verify adversarial robustness. While Reluplex and other similar techniques can effectively determine if a network satisfies a given specification, they do not offer a way to guarantee that the network will meet those specifications. Therefore, additional methods are needed to adjust networks if it is found that they are not meeting the desired properties. There has been an increase in techniques for designing networks with certified adversarial robustness, but enforcing more general safety properties in neural networks is still largely unexplored. One ap- proach to achieving provably correct neural networks is through abstraction-refinement optimization. This approach has been applied to the ACAS-Xu dataset, but the network was not guaranteed to meet the specifications until after training. Our work seeks to design networks with enforced input-output constraints even before training has been completed. This will allow for online learning scenarios where a system has to guarantee safety throughout its operation. This paper presents an approach for designing a safe predictor (a neural network or any other machine learning model) that will always meet a set of constraints on the input-output relationship. This assumes that the constrained output regions can be formulated to be convex. Our correct- by-construction safe predictor is guaranteed to satisfy the constraints, even before training, and at every training step. We describe our approach in Section 2, and show its use in an aircraft collision avoidance problem in Section 3. Results on synthetic datasets can be found in Appendix B. . 2 Method Considering two normed vector spaces, an input space X and an output space Y , and a collection of c different pairs of input-output constraints, (Ai, Bi), where Ai ⊆X and Bi is a convex subset of Y for each constraint i, the goal is to design a safe predictor, F : X →Y , that guarantees x ∈Ai ⇒F(x) ∈Bi. Let b be a bit-string of length c. Define Ob as the set of points z such that, for all i, bi = 1 implies z ∈Ai, and bi = 0 implies z /∈Ai. Ob thus represents the overlap regions for each combination of input constraints. For example, O101 is the set of points in A1 and A3, but not in A2, and O0...0 is the set where no input constraints apply. We also define O as the set of bit strings, b, such that Ob is non-empty, and define k = |O|. The sets {Ob : b ∈O} create a partition of X according to the combination of input constraints that apply. Given: • c different input constraint proximity functions, σi : X →[0, 1], where σi is continuous and ∀x ∈Ai, σi(x) = 0, • k different constrained predictors, Gb : X →Bb, one for each b ∈O, such that the domain of each Gb is non-empty, We define: • a set of weighting functions, wb(x) = Q i:bi=1(1−σi(x)) Q i:bi=0 σi(x) P b∈O Q i:bi=1(1−σi(x)) Q i:bi=0 σi(x), where P b∈O wb(x) = 1, and • a safe predictor, F(x) = P b∈O wb(x)Gb(x). Theorem 2.1. For all i, if x ∈Ai, then F(x) ∈Bi. A formal proof of Theorem 2.1 is presented in Appendix A and can be summarized as: if an input is in Ai, then by construction of the proximity and weighting functions, all of the constrained predictors, Gb, that do not map to Bi will be given zero weight. Only the constrained predictors that map to Bi will be given non-zero weight, and because of the convexity of Bi, the weighted average of the predictions will remain in Bi. If all Gb are continuous and if there are no two input sets, Ai and Aj, for which (Ai ∩Aj) ⊂ (∂Ai∪∂Aj), then F will be continuous. In the worst case, as the number of constraints grows linearly, the number of constrained predictors needed to describe our safe predictor grows exponentially. In practice, however, we expect many of the constraint overlap sets, Ob, to be empty. Consequently, any predictors corresponding to an empty set can be ignored. This significantly reduces the number of constrained predictors needed for many applications. See Figure 1 for an illustrative example of how to construct F(x) for a notional problem with two overlapping input-output constraints. 2.1 Proximity Functions The proximity functions, σi, describe how close an input, x, is to a particular input constraint region, Ai. These functions are used to compute the weights of the constrained predictors. A desirable property for σi is for σi(x) →1 as d(x, Ai) →∞, for some distance function. This ensures that when an input is far from a constraint region, that constraint has little influence on the prediction for that input. A natural choice for such a function is: σi(x; Σi) = 1 −exp  −d(x, Ai) σ1 σ2 . Here, Σi is a set of parameters σ1 ∈(0, ∞) and σ2 ∈(1, ∞), which can be specified based on engineering judgment, or learned using optimization over training data. In our experiments in this paper, we use proximity functions of this form and learn independent parameters for each input-constrained region. We plan to explore other choices for proximity functions in future work. 2 2.2 Learning If we have families of differentiable functions Gb(x; θb), continuously parameterized by θb, and families of σi(x; χi), differentiable and continuously parameterized by χi, then F(x; Θ, X), where Θ = {θb : b ∈O} and X = {χi : i = 1, ..., c}, is also continuously parameterized and differentiable. We can thus apply standard optimization techniques (e.g., gradient descent) to find parameters of F that minimize a loss function on some dataset, while also preserving the desired safety properties. Note that the safety guarantee holds regardless of the parameters. To create each Gb(x; θb) we consider choosing: • a latent space Rm, • a map hb : Rm →Bb, • a standard neural network architecture gb : X →Rm, and then defining Gb(x; θb) = hb(gb(x; θb)). The framework proposed here does not require an entirely separate network for each b. In many applications, it may be advantageous for the constrained predictors to share earlier layers, thus creating a shared representation of the input space. In addition, our definition of the safe predictor is general and is not limited to neural networks. In Appendix B, we show examples of applying our approach to synthetic datasets in 2-D and 3-D with simple neural networks. These examples show that our safe predictor can enforce arbitrary input-output specifications using convex output constraints on neural networks, and that the learned function is smooth. 3 Application to Aircraft Collision Avoidance Aircraft collision avoidance requires robust safety guarantees. The Next-Generation Collision Avoidance System (ACAS X), which issues advisories to prevent near mid-air collisions, has both manned (ACAS Xa) and unmanned (ACAS Xu) variants. The system was originally designed to choose optimal advisories while minimizing disruptive alerts by solving a partially observable Markov decision process. The solution took the form of a large look-up table, mapping each possible input combination to scores for all possible advisories. The advisory with the highest score would then be issued. By using a deep neural network (DNN) to compress the policy tables, it has been necessary to verify that the DNNs meet certain safety specifications. A desirable ˘201csafeability˘201d property for ACAS X was defined in a previous work. This property speci01ed that for any given input state within the ˘201csafeable region,˘201d an advisory would never be issued that could put the aircraft into a state where a safe advisory would no longer exist. This concept is similar to control invariance. A simplified model of the ACAS Xa system was created, named VerticalCAS. DNNs were then generated to approximate the learned policy, and Reluplex was used to verify whether the DNNs satisfied the safeability property. This work found thousands of counterexamples where the DNNs did not meet the criteria. Our approach for designing a safe predictor ensures any collision avoidance system will meet the safeability property by construction. Appendix C describes in detail how we apply our approach to a subset of the VerticalCAS datasets using a conservative, convex approximation of the safeability constraints. These constraints are defined such that if an aircraft state is in the ""unsafeable region"", Aunsafeable,i, for the ith advisory, the score for that advisory must not be the highest, i.e., x ∈ Aunsafeable,i ⇒Fi(x) < maxj Fj(x), where Fj(x) is the output score for the jth advisory. Table 1 shows the performance of a standard, unconstrained network and our safe predictor. For both networks, we present the percentage accuracy (ACC) and violations (percentage of inputs for which the network outputs an unsafe advisory). We train and test using PyTorch with two separate datasets, based on the previous advisory being Clear of Conflict (COC) and Climb at 1500 ft/min (CL1500). As shown in the table, our safe predictor adheres to the required safeability property. Furthermore, the accuracy of our predictor remains the same as the unconstrained network, demonstrating we are not losing accuracy to achieve safety guarantees. 3 Table 1: Results of the best configurations of β-TCVAE on DCI, FactorVAE, SAP, MIG, and IRS metrics.

The novelty of our approach is its simplicity and guaranteed enforcement of specifications through combinations of convex output constraints during all stages of training. Future work includes adapting and using techniques from optimization and control barrier functions, as well as incorporating notions of adversarial robustness into our design, such as extending the work to bound the Lipschitz constant of our networks. Appendix A: Proof of Theorem 2.1 Proof. Fix i and assume that x ∈Ai. It follows that σi(x) = 0, so for all b ∈O where bi = 0, wb(x) = 0. Thus, F(x) = X b∈O,bi=1 wb(x)Gb(x). If bi = 1, Gb(x) ∈Bi, and thus F(x) is also in Bi by the convexity of Bi. Appendix B: Example on Synthetic Datasets Figure 2 depicts an example of applying our safe predictor to a notional regression problem. This example uses inputs and outputs in 1-D with one input-output constraint. The unconstrained network consists of a single hidden layer with a dimension of 10, ReLU activations, and a fully connected layer. The safe predictor shares this structure with the unconstrained network but has its own fully connected layer for the constrained predictors, G0 and G1. Training uses a sampled subset of points from the input space. Figure 3 shows an example of applying our safe predictor to a notional regression problem with a 2-D input and 1-D output, using two overlapping constraints. The unconstrained network has two hidden layers of dimension 20 and ReLU activations, followed by a fully connected layer. The constrained predictors, G00, G10, G01, and G11, share the hidden layers but also have an additional hidden layer of size 20 with ReLU, followed by a fully connected layer. Training uses a sampled subset of points from the input space. Appendix C: Details of VerticalCAS Experiment C.1 Safeability Constraints The ""safeability"" property, originally introduced and used to verify the safety of the VerticalCAS neural networks can be encoded into a set of input-output constraints. The ""safeable region"" for a given advisory represents input locations where that advisory can be selected such that future advisories exist that will prevent an NMAC. If no future advisories exist, the advisory is ""unsafeable"" and the corresponding input region is the ""unsafeable region"". Examples of these regions, and their proximity functions are shown in Figure 5 for the CL1500 advisory. The constraints we enforce are that x ∈Aunsafeable,i ⇒Fi(x) < maxj Fj(x), ∀i, where Aunsafeable,i is the unsafeable region for the ith advisory, and Fj(x) is the output score for the jth advisory. Because the output regions of the safeable constraints are not convex, we make a conservative approximation, enforcing Fi(x) = minj Fj(x), for all x ∈Aunsafeable,i. 4 C.2 Proximity Functions We start by generating the unsafeable region bounds from the open source code. We then compute a ""distance function"" between input space points (vO - vI, h, τ), and the unsafeable region for each advisory. These are not true distances but are 0 if and only if the data point is within the unsafeable set. These are then used to produce proximity functions as given in Equation 1. C.3 Structure of Predictors The compressed policy tables for ACAS Xu and VerticalCAS use neural networks with six hidden layers with a dimension of 45, and ReLU activation functions. We used the same architecture for the unconstrained network. For our constrained predictors, we use the same structure but have shared first four layers for all predictors. This provides a common learned representation of the input space, while allowing each predictor to adapt to its own constraints. After the shared layers, each constrained predictor has an additional two hidden layers and their final outputs are projected onto our convex approximation of the safe region of the output space, using Gb(x) = minj Gj(x). In our experiments, we set ϵ = 0.0001. With this construction, we needed 30 separate predictors to enforce the VerticalCAS safeability constraints. The number of nodes for the unconstrained and safe implementations were 270 and 2880, respectively. Our safe predictor is orders of magnitude smaller than the original look-up tables. C.4 Parameter Optimization We use PyTorch for defining our networks and performing parameter optimization. We optimize both the unconstrained and safe predictors using the asymmetric loss function to select advisories while also accurately predicting scores. The data is split using an 80/20 train/test split with a random seed of 0. The optimizer is ADAM with a learning rate of 0.0003 and batch size of 216, with training for 500 epochs. Appendix A: Proof of Theorem 2.1 Proof. Let x ∈Ai. Then, σi(x) = 0, and for all b ∈O where bi = 0, wb(x) = 0. Thus, F(x) = X b∈O,bi=1 wb(x)Gb(x) If bi = 1, then Gb(x) ∈Bi, and therefore F(x) is in Bi due to the convexity of Bi. Appendix B: Example on Synthetic Datasets Figure 2 depicts an example of applying our safe predictor to a notional regression problem with 1-D input and outputs, and one input-output constraint. The unconstrained network has a single hidden layer of dimension 10 with ReLU activations, followed by a fully connected layer. The safe predictor shares this structure with constrained predictors, G0 and G1, but each predictor has its own fully connected layer. The training uses a sampled subset of points from the input space and the learned predictors are shown for the continuous input space. Figure 3 shows an example of applying the safe predictor to a notional regression problem with a 2-D input and 1-D output and two overlapping constraints. The unconstrained network has two hidden layers of dimension 20 with ReLU activations, followed by a fully connected layer. The constrained predictors G00, G10, G01 and G11 share the hidden layers and have an additional hidden layer of size 20 with ReLU followed by a fully connected layer. Again, training uses a sampled subset of points from the input space and the learned predictors are shown for the continuous input space. 5 Appendix C: Details of VerticalCAS Experiment C.1 Safeability Constraints The “safeability” property from prior work can be encoded into a set of input-output constraints. The “safeable region” for a given advisory is the set of input space locations where that advisory can be chosen, for which future advisories exist that will prevent an NMAC. If no future advisories exist for preventing an NMAC, the advisory is deemed “unsafeable,” and the corresponding input region is the “unsafeable region.” Figure 5 shows an example of these regions for the CL1500 advisory. The constraints we enforce in our safe predictor are: x ∈Aunsafeable,i ⇒Fi(x) < maxj Fj(x), ∀i. To make the output regions convex, we approximate by enforcing Fi(x) = minj Fj(x), for all x ∈Aunsafeable,i. C.2 Proximity Functions We start by generating the bounds on the unsafeable regions. Then, a distance function is computed between points in the input space (vO −vI, h, τ), and the unsafeable region for each advisory. While these are not true distances, their values are 0 if and only if the data point is inside the unsafeable set. When used to produce proximity functions as given in Equation 1, these values help ensure safety. Figure 5 shows examples of the unsafeable region, distance function, and proximity function for the CL1500 advisory. C.3 Structure of Predictors The compressed versions of the policy tables from prior work are neural networks with six hidden layers, 45 dimensions in each layer, and ReLU activation functions. We use the same architecture for our standard, unconstrained network. For constrained predictors, we use a similar architecture. However, the first four hidden layers are shared between all of the predictors. This learns a single, shared input space representation, and also allows each predictor to adapt to its constraints. Each constrained predictor has two additional hidden layers and their outputs are projected onto our convex approximation of the safe output region. We accomplish this by setting the score for any unsafeable advisory i to Gi(x) = minj Gj(x) −ϵ. In our experiments, we used ϵ = 0.0001. To enforce the VerticalCAS safeability constraints, we need 30 separate predictors. This increases the size of the network from 270 to 2880 nodes for the unconstrained and safe implementations respectively. However, our safe predictor remains smaller than the original look-up tables by several orders of magnitude. C.4 Parameter Optimization We define our networks and perform parameter optimization using PyTorch. We optimize the parameters of both the unconstrained network and our safe predictor using the asymmetric loss function, guiding the network to select optimal advisories while accurately predicting scores from the look-up tables. Each dataset is split using an 80/20 train/test split, with a random seed of 0. The optimizer is ADAM, with a learning rate of 0.0003, a batch size of 216, and the number of training epochs is 500. 6",1,,,,
P013.pdf,"Generalization in ReLU Networks via Restricted Isometry and Norm Concentration Abstract Regression tasks, while aiming to model relationships across the entire input space, are often constrained by limited training data. Nevertheless, if the hypothesis func- tions can be represented effectively by the data, there is potential for identifying a model that generalizes well. This paper introduces the Neural Restricted Isometry Property (NeuRIPs), which acts as a uniform concentration event that ensures all shallow ReLU networks are sketched with comparable quality. To determine the sample complexity necessary to achieve NeuRIPs, we bound the covering numbers of the networks using the Sub-Gaussian metric and apply chaining techniques. As- suming the NeuRIPs event, we then provide bounds on the expected risk, applicable to networks within any sublevel set of the empirical risk. Our results show that all networks with sufficiently small empirical risk achieve uniform generalization. 1 Introduction A fundamental requirement of any scientific model is a clear evaluation of its limitations. In recent years, supervised machine learning has seen the development of tools for automated model discovery from training data. However, these methods often lack a robust theoretical framework to estimate model limitations. Statistical learning theory quantifies the limitation of a trained model by the generalization error. This theory uses concepts such as the VC-dimension and Rademacher complexity to analyze generalization error bounds for classification problems. While these traditional complexity notions have been successful in classification problems, they do not apply to generic regression problems with unbounded risk functions, which are the focus of this study. Moreover, traditional tools in statistical learning theory have not been able to provide a fully satisfying generalization theory for neural networks. Understanding the risk surface during neural network training is crucial for establishing a strong theoretical foundation for neural network-based machine learning, particularly for understanding generalization. Recent studies on neural networks suggest intriguing properties of the risk surface. In large networks, local minima of the risk form a small bond at the global minimum. Surprisingly, global minima exist in each connected component of the risk’s sublevel set and are path-connected. In this work, we contribute to a generalization theory for shallow ReLU networks, by giving uniform generalization error bounds within the empirical risk’s sublevel set. We use methods from the analysis of convex linear regression, where generalization bounds for empirical risk minimizers are derived from recent advancements in stochastic processes’ chaining theory. Empirical risk minimization for non-convex hypothesis functions cannot generally be solved efficiently. However, under certain assumptions, it is still possible to derive generalization error bounds, as we demonstrate in this paper for shallow ReLU networks. Existing works have applied methods from compressed sensing to bound generalization errors for arbitrary hypothesis functions. However, they do not capture the risk’s stochastic nature through the more advanced chaining theory. This paper is organized as follows. We begin in Section II by outlining our assumptions about the parameters of shallow ReLU networks and the data distribution to be interpolated. The expected and empirical risk are introduced in Section III, where we define the Neural Restricted Isometry Property . (NeuRIPs) as a uniform norm concentration event. We present a bound on the sample complexity for achieving NeuRIPs in Theorem 1, which depends on both the network architecture and parameter assumptions. We provide upper bounds on the generalization error that are uniformly applicable across the sublevel sets of the empirical risk in Section IV. We prove this property in a network recovery setting in Theorem 2, and also an agnostic learning setting in Theorem 3. These results ensure a small generalization error, when any optimization algorithm finds a network with a small empirical risk. We develop the key proof techniques for deriving the sample complexity of achieving NeuRIPs in Section V, by using the chaining theory of stochastic processes. The derived results are summarized in Section VI, where we also explore potential future research directions. 2 Notation and Assumptions In this section, we will define the key notations and assumptions for the neural networks examined in this study. A Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) function ϕ : R →R is given by ϕ(x) := max(x, 0). Given a weight vector w ∈Rd, a bias b ∈R, and a sign κ ∈{±1}, a ReLU neuron is a function ϕ(w, b, κ) : Rd →R defined as ϕ(w, b, κ)(x) = κϕ(wT x + b). Shallow neural networks are constructed as weighted sums of neurons. Typically they are represented by a graph with n neurons in a single hidden layer. When using the ReLU activation function, we can apply a symmetry procedure to represent these as sums: ¯ϕ¯p(x) = n X i=0 ϕpi(x), where ¯p is the tuple (p1, . . . , pn). Assumption 1. The parameters ¯p, which index shallow ReLU networks, are drawn from a set ¯P ⊆(Rd × R × {±1})n. For ¯P, we assume there exist constants cw ≥0 and cb ∈[1, 3], such that for all parameter tuples ¯p = {(w1, b1, κ1), . . . , (wn, bn, κn)} ∈¯P, we have ∥wi∥≤cw and |bi| ≤cb. We denote the set of shallow networks indexed by a parameter set ¯P by Φ ¯ P := {ϕ¯p : ¯p ∈¯P}. We now equip the input space Rd of the networks with a probability distribution. This distribution reflects the sampling process and makes each neural network a random variable. Additionally, a random label y takes its values in the output space R, for which we assume the following. Assumption 2. The random sample x ∈Rd and label y ∈R follow a joint distribution µ such that the marginal distribution µx of sample x is standard Gaussian with density 1 (2π)d/2 exp  −∥x∥2 2  . As available data, we assume independent copies {(xj, yj)}m j=1 of the random pair (x, y), each distributed by µ. 3 Concentration of the Empirical Norm Supervised learning algorithms interpolate labels y for samples x, both distributed jointly by µ on X × Y. This task is often solved under limited data accessibility. The training data, respecting Assumption 2, consists of m independent copies of the random pair (x, y). During training, the interpolation quality of a hypothesis function f : X →Y can only be assessed at the given random samples {xj}m j=1. Any algorithm therefore accesses each function f through its sketch samples S[f] = (f(x1), . . . , f(xm)), 2 where S is the sample operator. After training, the quality of a resulting model is often measured by its generalization to new data not used during training. With Rd × R as the input and output space, we quantify a function f’s generalization error with its expected risk: Eµ[f] := Eµ|y −f(x)|2. The functional || · ||µ, also gives the norm of the space L2(Rd, µx), which consists of functions f : Rd →R with ∥f∥2 µ := Eµx[|f(x)|2]. If the label y depends deterministically on the associated sample x, we can treat y as an element of L2(Rd, µx), and the expected risk of any function f is the function’s distance to y. By sketching any hypothesis function f with the sample operator S, we perform a Monte-Carlo approximation of the expected risk, which is termed the empirical risk: ∥f∥2 m := 1 m m X j=1 (f(xj) −yj)2 = 1 √m(y1, . . . , ym)T −S[f] 2 2 . The random functional || · ||m also defines a seminorm on L2(Rd, µx), referred to as the empirical norm. Under mild assumptions, || · ||m fails to be a norm. In order to obtain a well generalizing model, the goal is to identify a function f with a low expected risk. However, with limited data, we are restricted to optimizing the empirical risk. Our strategy for deriving generalization guarantees is based on the stochastic relation between both risks. If {xj}m j=1 are independently distributed by µx, the law of large numbers implies that for any f ∈L2(Rd, µx) the convergence lim m→∞∥f∥m = ∥f∥µ. While this establishes the asymptotic convergence of the empirical norm to the function norm for a single function f, we have to consider two issues to formulate our concept of norm concentration: First, we need non-asymptotic results, that is bounds on the distance |∥f∥m −∥f∥µ| for a fixed number of samples m. Second, the bounds on the distance need to be uniformly valid for all functions f in a given set. Sample operators which have uniform concentration properties have been studied as restricted isometries in the area of compressed sensing. For shallow ReLU networks of the form (1), we define the restricted isometry property of the sampling operator S as follows. Definition 1. Let s ∈(0, 1) be a constant and ¯P be a parameter set. We say that the Neural Restricted Isometry Property (NeuRIPs( ¯P)) is satisfied if, for all ¯p ∈¯P it holds that (1 −s)∥ϕ¯p∥µ ≤∥ϕ¯p∥m ≤(1 + s)∥ϕ¯p∥µ. In the following Theorem, we provide a bound on the number m of samples, which is sufficient for the operator S to satisfy NeuRIPs( ¯P). Theorem 1. There exist universal constants C1, C2 ∈R such that the following holds: For any sample operator S, constructed from random samples {xj}, respecting Assumption 2, let ¯P ⊂(Rd × R × {±1})n be any parameter set satisfying Assumption 1 and ||ϕ¯p||µ > 1 for all ¯p ∈¯P. Then, for any u > 2 and s ∈(0, 1), NeuRIPs( ¯P) is satisfied with probability at least 1 −17 exp(−u/4) provided that m ≥ n3c2 w (1 −s)2 max  C1 (8cb + d + ln(2)) u , C2 n2c2 w (u/s)2  . One should notice that, in Theorem 1, there is a tradeoff between the parameter s, which limits the deviation | ∥· ∥m −∥· ∥µ|, and the confidence parameter u. The lower bound on the corresponding sample size m is split into two scaling regimes when understanding the quotient u of |∥·∥m−∥·∥µ|/s as a precision parameter. While in the regime of low deviations and high probabilities the sample size m must scale quadratically with u/s, in the regime of less precise statements one observes a linear scaling. 3 4 Uniform Generalization of Sublevel Sets of the Empirical Risk When the NeuRIPs event occurs, the function norm || · ||µ, which is related to the expected risk, is close to || · ||m, which corresponds to the empirical risk. Motivated by this property, we aim to find a shallow ReLU network ϕ¯p with small expected risk by solving the empirical risk minimization problem: min ¯p∈¯ P ∥ϕ¯p −y∥2 m. Since the set Φ ¯ P of shallow ReLU networks is non-convex, this minimization cannot be solved with efficient convex optimizers. Therefore, instead of analyzing only the solution ϕ∗ ¯p of the opti- mization problem, we introduce a tolerance ϵ > 0 for the empirical risk and provide bounds on the generalization error, which hold uniformly on the sublevel set ¯Qy,ϵ :=  ¯p ∈¯P : ∥ϕ¯p −y∥2 m ≤ϵ . Before considering generic regression problems, we will initially assume the label y to be a neural network itself, parameterized by a tuple p∗within the hypothesis set P. For all (x, y) in the support of µ, we have y = ϕp∗(x) and the expected risk’s minimum on P is zero. Using the sufficient condition for NeuRIPs from Theorem 1, we can provide generalization bounds for ϕ¯p ∈¯Qy,ϵ for any ϵ > 0. Theorem 2. Let ¯P be a parameter set that satisfies Assumption 1 and let u ≥2 and t ≥ϵ > 0 be constants. Furthermore, let the number m of samples satisfy m ≥8n3c2 w (8cb + d + ln(2)) max  C1 u (t −ϵ)2 , C2 n2c2 wu (t −ϵ)2  , where C1 and C2 are universal constants. Let {(xj, yj)}m j=1 be a dataset respecting Assumption 2 and let there exist a ¯p∗∈¯P such that yj = ϕ¯p∗(xj) holds for all j ∈[m]. Then, with probability at least 1 −17 exp(−u/4), we have for all ¯q ∈¯Qy,ϵ that ∥ϕ¯q −ϕ¯p∗∥2 µ ≤t. Proof. We notice that ¯Qy,ϵ is a set of shallow neural networks with 2n neurons. We normalize such networks with a function norm greater than t and parameterize them by ¯Rt := {ϕ¯p −ϕ¯p∗: ¯p ∈¯P, ∥ϕ¯p −ϕ¯p∗∥µ > t}. We assume that NeuRIPs( ¯Rt) holds for s = (t −ϵ)2/t2. In this case, for all ¯q ∈¯Qy,ϵ, we have that ∥ϕ¯q −ϕ¯p∗∥m ≥t and thus ¯q /∈¯Qϕ¯ p∗,ϵ, which implies that ∥ϕ¯q −ϕ¯p∗∥µ ≤t. We also note that ¯Rt satisfies Assumption 1 with a rescaled constant cw/t and normalization-invariant cb, if ¯P satisfies it for cw and cb. Theorem 1 gives a lower bound on the sample complexity for NeuRIPs( ¯Rt), completing the proof. At any network where an optimization method terminates, the concentration of the empirical risk at the expected risk can be achieved with less data than needed to achieve an analogous NeuRIPs event. However, in the chosen stochastic setting, we cannot assume that the termination of an optimization and the norm concentration at that network are independent events. We overcome this by not specifying the outcome of an optimization method and instead stating uniform bounds on the norm concentration. The only assumption on an algorithm is therefore the identification of a network that permits an upper bound ϵ on its empirical risk. The event NeuRIPs( ¯Rt) then restricts the expected risk to be below the corresponding level t. We now discuss the empirical risk surface for generic distributions µ that satisfy Assumption 2, where y does not necessarily have to be a neural network. Theorem 3. There exist constants C0, C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 such that the following holds: Let ¯P satisfy Assumption 1 for some constants cw, cb, and let ¯p∗∈¯P be such that for some c¯p∗≥0 we have Eµ  exp (y −ϕ¯p∗(x))2 c2 ¯p∗  ≤2. We assume, for any s ∈(0, 1) and confidence parameter u > 0, that the number of samples m is large enough such that m ≥ 8 (1 −s)2 max  C1 n3c2 w(8cb + d + ln(2)) u  , C2n2c2 w u s  . 4 We further select confidence parameters v1, v2 > C0, and define for some ω ≥0 the parameter η := 2(1 −s)∥ϕ¯p∗−y∥µ + C3v1v2c¯p∗ 1 (1 −s)1/4 + ω √ 1 −s. If we set ϵ = ∥ϕ¯p∗−y∥2 m + ω2 as the tolerance for the empirical risk, then the probability that all ¯q ∈¯Qy,ϵ satisfy ∥ϕ¯q −y∥µ ≤η is at least 1 −17 exp  −u 4  −C5v2 exp  −C4mv2 2 2  . Proof sketch. (Complete proof in Appendix E) We first define and decompose the excess risk by E(¯q, ¯p∗) := ∥ϕ¯q −y∥2 µ −∥ϕ¯p∗−y∥2 µ = ∥ϕ¯q −ϕ¯p∗∥2 µ −2 m m X j=1 (ϕ¯p∗(xj) −yj)(ϕ¯q(xj) −ϕ¯p∗(xj)). It suffices to show, that within the stated confidence level we have ∥ϕ¯q −y∥µ > η . This implies the claim since ∥ϕ¯q −y∥m ≤ϵ implies ∥ϕ¯q −y∥µ ≤η. We have E[E(¯q, ¯p∗)] > 0. It now only remains to strengthen the condition on η > 3∥ϕ¯p∗−y∥µ to achieve E(¯q, ¯p∗) > ω2. We apply Theorem 1 to derive a bound on the fluctuation of the first term. The concentration rate of the second term is derived similar to Theorem 1 by using chaining techniques. Finally in Appendix E, Theorem 12 gives a general bound to achieve E(¯q, ¯p∗) > ω2 uniformly for all ¯q with ∥ϕ¯q −ϕ¯p∗∥µ > η. Theorem 3 then follows as a simplification. It is important to notice that, in Theorem 3, as the data size m approaches infinity, one can select an asymptotically small deviation constant s. In this limit, the bound η on the generalization error converges to 3∥ϕ¯p∗−y∥µ + ω. This reflects a lower limit of the generalization bound, which is the sum of the theoretically achievable minimum of the expected risk and the additional tolerance ω. The latter is an upper bound on the empirical risk, which real-world optimization algorithms can be expected to achieve. 5 Size Control of Stochastic Processes on Shallow Networks In this section, we introduce the key techniques for deriving concentration statements for the em- pirical norm, uniformly valid for sets of shallow ReLU networks. We begin by rewriting the event NeuRIPs( ¯P) by treating µ as a stochastic process, indexed by the parameter set ¯P. The event NeuRIPs( ¯P) holds if and only if we have sup ¯p∈¯ P |∥ϕ¯p∥m −∥ϕ¯p∥µ| ≤s sup ¯p∈¯ P ∥ϕ¯p∥µ. The supremum of stochastic processes has been studied in terms of their size. To determine the size of a process, it is essential to determine the correlation between its variables. To this end, we define the Sub-Gaussian metric for any parameter tuples ¯p, ¯q ∈¯P as dψ2(ϕ¯p, ϕ¯q) := inf ( Cψ2 ≥0 : E "" exp |ϕ¯p(x) −ϕ¯q(x)|2 C2 ψ2 !# ≤2 ) . A small Sub-Gaussian metric between random variables indicates that their values are likely to be close. To capture the Sub-Gaussian structure of a process, we introduce ϵ-nets in the Sub-Gaussian metric. For a given ϵ > 0, these are subsets ¯Q ⊆¯P such that for every ¯p ∈¯P, there is a ¯q ∈¯Q satisfying dψ2(ϕ¯p, ϕ¯q) ≤ϵ. The smallest cardinality of such an ϵ-net ¯Q is known as the Sub-Gaussian covering number N(Φ ¯ P , dψ2, ϵ). The next Lemma offers a bound for such covering numbers specific to shallow ReLU networks. 5 Lemma 1. Let ¯P be a parameter set satisfying Assumption 1. Then there exists a set ˆP with ¯P ⊆ˆP such that N(Φ ˆ P , dψ2, ϵ) ≤2n · 16ncbcw ϵ + 1 n · 32ncbcw ϵ + 1 n · 1 ϵ sin  1 16ncw  + 1 d . The proof of this Lemma is based on the theory of stochastic processes and can be seen in Theorem 8 of Appendix C. To obtain bounds of the form (6) on the size of a process, we use the generic chaining method. This method offers bounds in terms of the Talagrand-functional of the process in the Sub-Gaussian metric. We define it as follows. A sequence T = (Tk)k∈N0 in a set T is admissible if T0 = 1 and Tk ≤2(2k). The Talagrand-functional of the metric space is then defined as γ2(T, d) := inf (Tk) sup t∈T ∞ X k=0 2kd(t, Tk), where the infimum is taken across all admissible sequences. With the bounds on the Sub-Gaussian covering number from Lemma 1, we provide a bound on the Talagrand-functional for shallow ReLU networks in the following Lemma. This bound is expected to be of independent interest. Lemma 2. Let ¯P satisfy Assumption 1. Then we have γ2(Φ ¯ P , dψ2) ≤ r 2 π 8n3/2cw(8cb + d + 1) ln(2) p 2 ln(2)  . The key ideas to show this bound are similar to the ones used to prove Theorem 9 in Appendix C. To provide bounds for the empirical process, we use the following Lemma, which we prove in Appendix D. Lemma 3. Let Φ be a set of real functions, indexed by a parameter set ¯P and define N(Φ) := Z ∞ 0 q ln N(Φ, dψ2, ϵ)dϵ and ∆(Φ) := sup ϕ∈Φ ∥ϕ∥ψ2. Then, for any u ≥2, we have with probability at least 1 −17 exp(−u/4) that sup ϕ∈Φ |∥ϕ∥m −∥ϕ∥µ| ≤ u √m  N(Φ) + 10 3 ∆(Φ)  . The bounds on the sample complexity for achieving the NeuRIPs event, from Theorem 1, are proven by applying these Lemmata. Proof of Theorem 1. Since we assume ||ϕ¯p||µ > 1 for all ¯p ∈¯P, we have sup ¯p∈¯ P |∥ϕ¯p∥m −∥ϕ¯p∥µ| ≤sup ¯p∈¯ P |∥ϕ¯p∥m −∥ϕ¯p∥µ|/∥ϕ¯p∥µ. Applying Lemma 3, and further applying the bounds on the covering numbers and the Talagrand- functional for shallow ReLU networks, the NeuRIPs( ¯P) event holds in case of s > 3. The sample complexities that are provided in Theorem 1 follow from a refinement of this condition. 6 Uniform Generalization of Sublevel Sets of the Empirical Risk In case of the NeuRIPs event, the function norm || · ||µ corresponding to the expected risk is close to || · ||m, which corresponds to the empirical risk. With the previous results, we can now derive uniform generalization error bounds in the sublevel set of the empirical risk. We use similar techniques and we define the following sets. ∥f∥p = sup 1≤q≤p ∥f∥q Λk0,u = inf (Tk) sup f∈F ∞ X k0 2k∥f −Tk(f)∥u2k 6 and we need the following lemma: Lemma 9. For any set F of functions and u ≥1, we have Λ0,u(F) ≤2√e(γ2(F, dψ2) + ∆(F)). Theorem 10. Let P be a parameter set satisfying Assumption 1. Then, for any u ≥1, we have with probability at least 1 −17 exp(−u/4) that sup ¯p∈P ∥ϕ¯p∥m −∥ϕ¯p∥µ ≤ u √m  16n3/2cw(8cb + d + 1) + 2ncw  . Proof. To this end we have to bound the Talagrand functional, where we can use Dudley’s inequality (Lemma 6). To finish the proof, we apply the bounds on the covering numbers provided by Theorem 6. Theorem 11. Let ¯P ⊆(Rd × R × ±1)n satisfy Assumption 1. Then there exist universal constants C1, C2 such that sup ¯p∈P ∥ϕ¯p∥m −∥ϕ¯p∥µ ≤ r 2 π 8n3/2cw(8cb + d + 1) ln(2) p 2 ln(2)  . 7 Conclusion In this study, we investigated the empirical risk surface of shallow ReLU networks in terms of uniform concentration events for the empirical norm. We defined the Neural Restricted Isometry Property (NeuRIPs) and determined the sample complexity required to achieve NeuRIPs, which depends on realistic parameter bounds and the network architecture. We applied our findings to derive upper bounds on the expected risk, which are valid uniformly across sublevel sets of the empirical risk. If a network optimization algorithm can identify a network with a small empirical risk, our results guarantee that this network will generalize well. By deriving uniform concentration statements, we have resolved the problem of independence between the termination of an optimization algorithm at a certain network and the empirical risk concentration at that network. Future studies may focus on performing uniform empirical norm concentration on the critical points of the empirical risk, which could lead to even tighter bounds for the sample complexity. We also plan to apply our methods to input distributions more general than the Gaussian distribution. If generic Gaussian distributions can be handled, one could then derive bounds for the Sub-Gaussian covering number for deep ReLU networks by induction across layers. We also expect that our results on the covering numbers could be extended to more generic Lipschitz continuous activation functions other than ReLU. This proposition is based on the concentration of measure phenomenon, which provides bounds on the Sub-Gaussian norm of functions on normal concentrating input spaces. Because these bounds scale with the Lipschitz constant of the function, they can be used to find ϵ-nets for neurons that have identical activation patterns. Broader Impact Supervised machine learning now affects both personal and public lives significantly. Generalization is critical to the reliability and safety of empirically trained models. Our analysis aims to achieve a deeper understanding of the relationships between generalization, architectural design, and available data. We have discussed the concepts and demonstrated the effectiveness of using uniform concentration events for generalization guarantees of common supervised machine learning algorithms. 7",1,,,,
P014.pdf,"Addressing Min-Max Challenges in Nonconvex-Nonconcave Problems with Solutions Exhibiting Weak Minty Properties Abstract This research examines a specific category of structured nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems that demon- strate a characteristic known as weak Minty solutions. This concept, which has only recently been defined, has already demonstrated its effectiveness by encompassing various generalizations of monotonicity at the same time. We establish new convergence findings for an enhanced variant of the optimistic gradient method (OGDA) within this framework, achieving a convergence rate of 1/k for the most effective iteration, measured by the squared operator norm, a result that aligns with the extragradient method (EG). Furthermore, we introduce a modified version of EG that incorporates an adaptive step size, eliminating the need for prior knowledge of the problem’s specific parameters. 1 Introduction The recent advancements in machine learning models, particularly those that can be formulated as min-max optimization problems, have generated significant interest in saddle point problems. Examples of these models include generative adversarial networks, adversarial learning frameworks, adversarial example games, and actor-critic methods. While practical methods have been developed that generally perform well, the theoretical understanding of scenarios where the objective function is nonconvex in the minimization component and nonconcave in the maximization component remains limited, with some research even suggesting intractability in certain cases. A specific subset of nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems was analyzed, and it was found that the extragradient method (EG) exhibited favorable convergence behavior in experimental settings. Surprisingly, these problems did not appear to possess any of the recognized favorable characteristics, such as monotonicity or Minty solutions. Subsequently, a suitable concept was identified (see Assumption 1), which is less restrictive than the presence of a Minty solution (a condition frequently employed in the existing literature) and also extends the idea of negative comonotonicity. Because of these properties that unify and generalize, the concept of weak Minty solutions was quickly investigated. Assumption 1 (Weak Minty solution). For a given operator F : Rd →Rd, there is a point u∗∈Rd and a parameter ρ > 0 such that: ⟨F(u), u −u∗⟩≥−ρ 2∥F(u)∥2 ∀u ∈Rd. (1) Moreover, it has been demonstrated that a modified version of EG is capable of addressing problems with such solutions, achieving a complexity of O(ϵ−1) for the squared operator norm. This adaptation, referred to as EG+, is based on a bold extrapolation step followed by a cautious update step. A similar step size approach has been previously examined in the context of a stochastic variant of EG. In a similar vein, we explore a variation of the optimistic gradient descent ascent (OGDA), also known as Forward-Reflected- Backward (FoRB). We address the following question with an affirmative answer: Can OGDA achieve convergence guarantees comparable to those of EG when dealing with weak Minty solutions? Specifically, we demonstrate that a modified version of the OGDA method, defined for a step size a > 0 and a parameter 0 < γ ≤1 as follows: uk = ¯uk −aF(¯uk), ¯uk+1 = ¯uk −γaF(uk), ∀k ≥0, can achieve the same convergence bounds as EG+ by requiring only a single gradient oracle call in each iteration. It is worth noting that OGDA is most frequently expressed in a form where γ = 1. However, two recent studies have examined a more generalized coefficient. While these earlier studies focused on the monotone setting, the true significance of γ becomes apparent only when dealing with weak Minty solutions. In this context, we find that γ must be greater than 1 to ensure convergence, a phenomenon that is not observed in monotone problems. When examining a general smooth min-max problem: min x max y f(x, y) the operator F mentioned in Assumption 1 naturally emerges as F(u) := [∇xf(x, y), −∇yf(x, y)] with u = (x, y). However, by examining saddle point problems from the broader viewpoint of variational inequalities (VIs) through the operator F, we can concurrently address more scenarios, such as certain equilibrium problems. The parameter ρ in the definition of weak Minty solutions (1) is crucial for both the analysis and the experiments. Specifically, it is essential that the step size exceeds a value proportional to ρ. Simultaneously, as is typical, the step size is limited from above by the inverse of the Lipschitz constant of F. For instance, since some researchers require the step size to be less than 1 4L, their convergence claim is valid only if ρ < 1 4L. This condition was later improved to ρ < 1 2L for the choice γ = 1 and to ρ < 1 L for even smaller values of γ. As in the monotone setting, OGDA requires a smaller step size than EG. Nevertheless, through a different analysis, we are able to match the most general condition on the weak Minty parameter ρ < 1 L for appropriate γ and a. 1.1 Contribution Our contributions are summarized as follows: 1. We establish a new convergence rate of O(1/k), measured by the squared operator norm, for a modified version of OGDA, which we call OGDA+. This rate matches that of EG and builds upon the recently introduced concept of weak solutions to the Minty variational inequality. 2. Even when a stronger condition is imposed, specifically that the operator is also monotone, we enhance the range of feasible step sizes for OGDA+ and obtain the most favorable result known for the standard method (γ = 1). 3. We demonstrate a complexity bound of O(ϵ−2) for a stochastic variant of the OGDA+ method. 4. We also introduce an adaptive step size version of EG+. This version achieves the same convergence guarantees without requiring any knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of the operator F. Consequently, it can potentially take larger steps in areas with low curvature, enabling convergence where a fixed step size strategy might fail. 1.2 Related literature We will concentrate on the nonconvex-nonconcave setting, as there is a substantial body of work on convergence rates in terms of a gap function or distance to a solution for monotone problems, as well as generalizations such as nonconvex-concave, convex-nonconcave, or under the Polyak-Łojasiewicz assumption. Weak Minty. It was observed that a specific parameterization of the von Neumann ratio game exhibits a novel type of solution, termed ""weak Minty,"" without having any of the previously known characteristics like (negative) comonotonicity or Minty solutions. Convergence in the presence of such solutions was demonstrated for EG, provided that the extrapolation step size is twice as large as the update step. Subsequently, it was shown that the condition on the weak Minty parameter can be relaxed by further reducing the length of the update step, and this is done adaptively. To avoid the need for additional hyperparameters, a backtracking line search is also proposed, which may incur extra gradient computations or require second-order information (in contrast to the adaptive step size we propose in Algorithm 3). A different approach is taken by focusing on the min-max setting and using multiple ascent steps per descent step, achieving the same O(1/k) rate as EG. Minty solutions. Numerous studies have presented various methods for scenarios where the problem at hand has a Minty solution. It was shown that weakly monotone VIs can be solved by iteratively adding a quadratic proximity term and repeatedly optimizing the resulting strongly monotone VI using any convergent method. The convergence of the OGDA method was proven, but without a specific rate. It was noted that the convergence proof for the golden ratio algorithm (GRAAL) is valid without any changes. While the assumption that a Minty solution exists is a generalization of the monotone setting, it is challenging to find non-monotone problems that possess such solutions. In our setting, as per Assumption 1, the Minty inequality (MVI) can be violated at any point by a factor proportional to the squared operator norm. Negative comonotonicity. Although previously studied under the term ""cohypomonotonicity,"" the concept of negative comono- tonicity has recently been explored. It offers a generalization of monotonicity, but in a direction distinct from the concept of Minty solutions, and only a limited number of studies have examined methods in this context. An anchored version of EG was studied, and an improved convergence rate of O(1/k2) (in terms of the squared operator norm) was shown. Similarly, an accelerated version of the reflected gradient method was investigated. Whether such acceleration is possible in the more general setting of weak Minty solutions remains an open question (any Stampacchia solution to the VI given by a negatively comonotone operator is a weak Minty solution). Another intriguing observation was made, where for cohypomonotone problems, a monotonically decreasing gradient norm was demonstrated when using EG. However, we did not observe this in our experiments, emphasizing the need to differentiate this class from problems with weak Minty solutions. 2 Interaction dominance. The concept of α-interaction dominance for nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems was investigated, and it was shown that the proximal-point method converges sublinearly if this condition is met in y and linearly if it is met in both components. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that if a problem is interaction dominant in both components, it is also negatively comonotone. Optimism. The positive effects of introducing the simple modification commonly known as optimism have recently attracted the attention of the machine learning community. Its name comes from online optimization. The idea dates back even further and has also been studied in the mathematical programming community. 2 Preliminaries 2.1 Notions of solution We outline the most frequently used solution concepts in the context of variational inequalities (VIs) and related areas. These concepts are typically defined with respect to a constraint set C ⊆Rd. A Stampacchia solution of the VI given by F : Rd →Rd is a point u∗such that: ⟨F(u∗), u −u∗⟩≥0 ∀u ∈C. (SVI) In this work, we only consider the unconstrained case where C = Rd, and the above condition simplifies to F(u∗) = 0. Closely related is the following concept: A Minty solution is a point u∗∈C such that: ⟨F(u), u −u∗⟩≥0 ∀u ∈C. (MVI) For a continuous operator F, a Minty solution of the VI is always a Stampacchia solution. The converse is generally not true but holds, for example, if the operator F is monotone. Specifically, there are nonmonotone problems with Stampacchia solutions but without any Minty solutions. 2.2 Notions of monotonicity This section aims to revisit some fundamental and more contemporary concepts of monotonicity and the relationships between them. An operator F is considered monotone if: ⟨F(u) −F(v), u −v⟩≥0. Such operators naturally arise as the gradients of convex functions, from convex-concave min-max problems, or from equilibrium problems. Two frequently studied notions that fall into this category are strongly monotone operators, which satisfy: ⟨F(u) −F(v), u −v⟩≥µ∥u −v∥2, and cocoercive operators, which fulfill: ⟨F(u) −F(v), u −v⟩≥β∥F(u) −F(v)∥2. (2) Strongly monotone operators emerge as gradients of strongly convex functions or in strongly-convex-strongly-concave min-max problems. Cocoercive operators appear, for instance, as gradients of smooth convex functions, in which case (2) holds with β equal to the inverse of the gradient’s Lipschitz constant. Departing from monotonicity. Both of the aforementioned subclasses of monotonicity can serve as starting points for exploring the non-monotone domain. Given that general non-monotone operators may display erratic behavior, such as periodic cycles and spurious attractors, it is reasonable to seek settings that extend the monotone framework while remaining manageable. First and foremost is the extensively studied setting of ν-weak monotonicity: ⟨F(u) −F(v), u −v⟩≥−ν∥u −v∥2. Such operators arise as the gradients of the well-studied class of weakly convex functions, a rather general class of functions as it includes all functions without upward cusps. In particular, every smooth function with a Lipschitz gradient turns out to fulfill this property. On the other hand, extending the notion of cocoercivity to allow for negative coefficients, referred to as cohypomonotonicity, has received much less attention and is given by: ⟨F(u) −F(v), u −v⟩≥−γ∥F(u) −F(v)∥2. Clearly, if a Stampacchia solution exists for such an operator, then it also fulfills Assumption 1. Behavior with respect to the solution. While the above properties are standard assumptions in the literature, it is usually sufficient to require the corresponding condition to hold when one of the arguments is a (Stampacchia) solution. This means that instead of monotonicity, it is enough to ask for the operator F to be star-monotone, i.e., ⟨F(u), u −u∗⟩≥0, or star-cocoercive, ⟨F(u), u −u∗⟩≥γ∥F(u)∥2. In this spirit, we can provide a new interpretation to the assumption of the existence of a weak Minty solution as asking for the operator F to be negatively star-cocoercive (with respect to at least one solution). Furthermore, we want to point out that while the above star notions are sometimes required to hold for all solutions u∗, in the following we only require it to hold for a single solution. 3 3 OGDA for problems with weak Minty solutions The generalized version of OGDA, which we denote with a ""+"" to emphasize the presence of the additional parameter γ, is given by: Algorithm 1 OGDA+ Require: Starting point u0 = u−1 ∈Rd, step size a > 0 and parameter 0 < γ < 1. for k = 0, 1, ... do uk+1 = uk −a((1 + γ)F(uk) −F(uk−1)) end for Theorem 3.1. Let F : Rd →Rd be L-Lipschitz continuous satisfying Assumption 1 with 1 L > ρ, and let (uk)k≥0 be the iterates generated by Algorithm 1 with step size a satisfying a > ρ and aL ≤1 −γ 1 + γ . (3) Then, for all k ≥0, min i=0,...,k−1 ∥F(ui)∥2 ≤ 1 kaγ(a −ρ)∥u0 + aF(u0) −u∗∥2. In particular, as long as ρ < 1 L, we can find a γ small enough such that the above bound holds. The first observation is that we would like to choose a as large as possible, as this allows us to treat the largest class of problems with ρ < a. To be able to choose a large step size a, we must decrease γ, as evident from (3). However, this degrades the algorithm’s speed by making the update steps smaller. The same effect can be observed for EG+ and is therefore not surprising. One could derive an optimal γ (i.e., minimizing the right-hand side) from Theorem 3.1, but this results in a non-intuitive cubic dependence on ρ. In practice, the strategy of decreasing γ until convergence is achieved, but not further, yields reasonable results. Furthermore, we want to point out that the condition ρ < 1 L is precisely the best possible bound for EG+. 3.1 Improved bounds under monotonicity While the above theorem also holds if the operator F is monotone, we can modify the proof slightly to obtain a better dependence on the parameters: Theorem 3.2. Let F : Rd →Rd be monotone and L-Lipschitz. If aL = 2−γ 2+γ −ϵ for ϵ > 0, then the iterates generated by OGDA+ fulfill min i=0,...,k−1 ∥F(ui)∥2 ≤ 2 ka2γ2ϵ∥u0 + aF(u0) −u∗∥2. In particular, we can choose γ = 1 and a < 1 2L. There are different works discussing the convergence of OGDA in terms of the iterates or a gap function with a < 1 2L. However, we want to compare the above bound to more similar results on rates for the best iterate in terms of the operator norm. The same rate as ours for OGDA is shown, but requires the conservative step size bound a ≤ 1 16L. This was later improved to a ≤ 1 3L. All of these only deal with the case γ = 1. The only other reference that deals with a generalized (i.e., not necessarily γ = 1) version of OGDA is another work, where the resulting step size condition is a ≤2−γ 4L , which is strictly worse than ours for any γ. To summarize, not only do we show for the first time that the step size of a generalization of OGDA can go above 1 2L, but we also provide the least restrictive bound for any value of γ. 3.2 OGDA+ stochastic In this section, we discuss the setting where, instead of the exact operator F, we only have access to a collection of independent estimators F(·, ξi) at every iteration. We assume here that the estimator F is unbiased, i.e., E[F(uk, ξ)|uk−1] = F(uk), and has bounded variance E[∥F(uk, ξ) −F(uk)∥2] ≤σ2. We show that we can still guarantee convergence by using batch sizes B of order O(ϵ−1). Algorithm 2 stochastic OGDA+ Require: Starting point u0 = u−1 ∈Rd, step size a > 0, parameter 0 < γ ≤1 and batch size B. for k = 0, 1, ... do Sample i.i.d. (ξi)B i=1 and compute estimator ˜gk = 1 B PB i=1 F(uk, ξk i ) uk+1 = uk −a((1 + γ)˜gk −˜gk−1) end for 4 Theorem 3.3. Let F : Rd →Rd be L-Lipschitz satisfying Assumption 1 with 1 L > ρ, and let (uk)k≥0 be the sequence of iterates generated by stochastic OGDA+, with a and γ satisfying ρ < a < 1−γ 1+γ 1 L. Then, to visit an ϵ-stationary point such that mini=0,...,k−1 E[∥F(ui)∥2] < ϵ, we require 1 kaγ(a −ρ)∥u0 + a˜g0 −u∗∥2 max  1, 4σ2 aLϵ  calls to the stochastic oracle ˜F, with large batch sizes of order O(ϵ−1). In practice, large batch sizes of order O(ϵ−1) are typically not desirable; instead, a small or decreasing step size is preferred. In the weak Minty setting, this causes additional trouble due to the necessity of large step sizes to guarantee convergence. Unfortunately, the current analysis does not allow for variable γ. 4 EG+ with adaptive step sizes In this section, we present Algorithm 3, which is able to solve the previously mentioned problems without any knowledge of the Lipschitz constant L, as it is typically difficult to compute in practice. Additionally, it is well known that rough estimates will lead to small step sizes and slow convergence behavior. However, in the presence of weak Minty solutions, there is additional interest in choosing large step sizes. We observed in Theorem 3.1 and related works the fact that a crucial ingredient in the analysis is that the step size is chosen larger than a multiple of the weak Minty parameter ρ to guarantee convergence at all. For these reasons, we want to outline a method using adaptive step sizes, meaning that no step size needs to be supplied by the user and no line-search is carried out. Since the analysis of OGDA+ is already quite involved in the constant step size regime, we choose to equip EG+ with an adaptive step size which estimates the inverse of the (local) Lipschitz constant, see (4). Due to the fact that the literature on adaptive methods, especially in the context of VIs, is so vast, we do not aim to give a comprehensive review but highlight only a few with especially interesting properties. In particular, we do not want to touch on methods with a linesearch procedure, which typically result in multiple gradient computations per iteration. We use a simple and therefore widely used step size choice that naively estimates the local Lipschitz constant and forces a monotone decreasing behavior. Such step sizes have been used extensively for monotone VIs and similarly in the context of the mirror-prox method, which corresponds to EG in the setting of (non-Euclidean) Bregman distances. A version of EG with a different adaptive step size choice has been investigated, with the unique feature that it is able to achieve the optimal rates for both smooth and nonsmooth problems without modification. However, these rates are only for monotone VIs and are in terms of the gap function. One of the drawbacks of adaptive methods resides in the fact that the step sizes are typically required to be nonincreasing, which results in poor behavior if a high-curvature area was visited by the iterates before reaching a low-curvature region. To the best of our knowledge, the only method that is allowed to use nonmonotone step sizes to treat VIs and does not use a possibly costly linesearch is the golden ratio algorithm. It comes with the additional benefit of not requiring a global bound on the Lipschitz constant of F at all. While it is known that this method converges under the stronger assumption of the existence of Minty solutions, a quantitative convergence result is still open. Algorithm 3 EG+ with adaptive step size Require: Starting points u0, ¯u0 ∈Rd, initial step size a0 and parameters τ ∈(0, 1) and 0 < γ ≤1. for k = 0, 1, ... do Find the step size: ak = min  ak−1, τ∥¯uk −¯uk−1∥ ∥F(¯uk) −F(¯uk−1)∥  (4) Compute next iterate: uk = ¯uk −akF(¯uk) ¯uk+1 = ¯uk −akγF(uk). end for Clearly, ak is monotonically decreasing by construction. Moreover, it is bounded away from zero by the simple observation that ak ≥min{a0, τ/L} > 0. The sequence therefore converges to a positive number, which we denote by a∞:= limk ak. Theorem 4.1. Let F : Rd →Rd be L-Lipschitz that satisfies Assumption 1, where u∗denotes any weak Minty solution, with a∞> 2ρ, and let (uk)k≥0 be the iterates generated by Algorithm 3 with γ = 1 2 and τ ∈(0, 1). Then, there exists a k0 ∈N such that min i=k0,...,k ∥F(uk)∥2 ≤ 1 k −k0 L τ(a∞/2 −ρ)∥¯uk0 −u∗∥2. 5 Algorithm 3 presented above provides several benefits but also some drawbacks. The main advantage resides in the fact that the Lipschitz constant of the operator F does not need to be known. Moreover, the step size choice presented in (4) might allow us to take steps much larger than what would be suggested by a global Lipschitz constant if the iterates never, or only during later iterations, visit the region of high curvature (large local L). In such cases, these larger step sizes come with the additional advantage that they allow us to solve a richer class of problems, as we are able to relax the condition ρ < 1 4L in the case of EG+ to ρ < a∞/2, where a∞= limk ak ≥τ/L. On the other hand, we face the problem that the bounds in Theorem 4.1 only hold after an unknown number of initial iterations when ak/ak+1 ≤1 τ is finally satisfied. In theory, this might take a long time if the curvature around the solution is much higher than in the starting area, as this will force the need to decrease the step size very late into the solution process, resulting in the quotient ak/ak+1 being too large. This drawback could be mitigated by choosing τ smaller. However, this will result in poor performance due to small step sizes. Even for monotone problems where this type of step size has been proposed, this problem could not be circumvented, and authors instead focused on the convergence of the iterates without any rate. 5 Numerical experiments In the following, we compare the EG+ method with the two methods we propose: OGDA+ and EG+ with adaptive step size (see Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3, respectively). Last but not least, we also include the CurvatureEG+ method, which is a modification of EG+ that adaptively chooses the ratio of extrapolation and update steps. In addition, a backtracking linesearch is performed with an initial guess made by second-order information, whose extra cost we ignore in the experiments. 5.1 Von Neumann’s ratio game We consider von Neumann’s ratio game, which is given by: min x∈∆m max y∈∆n V (x, y) = ⟨x, Ry⟩ ⟨x, Sy⟩, (5) where R ∈Rm×n and S ∈Rm×n with ⟨x, Sy⟩> 0 for all x ∈∆m, y ∈∆n, with ∆:= {z ∈Rd : zi > 0, Pd i=1 zi = 1} denoting the unit simplex. Expression (5) can be interpreted as the value V (x, y) for a stochastic game with a single state and mixed strategies. We see an illustration of a particularly difficult instance of (5). Interestingly, we still observe good convergence behavior, although an estimated ρ is more than ten times larger than the estimated Lipschitz constant. 5.2 Forsaken A particularly difficult min-max toy example with a ""Forsaken"" solution was proposed and is given by: min x∈R max y∈R x(y −0.45) + ϕ(x) −ϕ(y), (6) where ϕ(z) = 1 6z6 −2 4z4 + 1 4z2 −1 2z. This problem exhibits a Stampacchia solution at (x∗, y∗) ≈(0.08, 0.4), but also two limit cycles not containing any critical point of the objective function. In addition, it was also observed that the limit cycle closer to the solution repels possible trajectories of iterates, thus ""shielding"" the solution. Later, it was noticed that, restricted to the box ∥(x, y)∥∞< 3, the above-mentioned solution is weak Minty with ρ ≥2 · 0.477761, which is much larger than 1 2L ≈0.08. In line with these observations, we can see that none of the fixed step size methods with a step size bounded by 1 L converge. In light of this observation, a backtracking linesearch was proposed, which potentially allows for larger steps than predicted by the global Lipschitz constant. Similarly, our proposed adaptive step size version of EG+ (see Algorithm 3) is also able to break through the repelling limit cycle and converge to the solution. On top of this, it does so at a faster rate and without the need for additional computations in the backtracking procedure. 5.3 Lower bound example The following min-max problem was introduced as a lower bound on the dependence between ρ and L for EG+: min x∈R max y∈R µxy + ζ 2(x2 −y2). (7) In particular, it was stated that EG+ (with any γ) and constant step size a = 1 L converges for this problem if and only if (0, 0) is a weak Minty solution with ρ < 1−γ L , where ρ and L can be computed explicitly in the above example and are given by: L = p µ2 + ζ2 and ρ = µ2 −ζ2 2µ . By choosing µ = 3 and ζ = −1, we get exactly ρ = 1 L, therefore predicting divergence of EG+ for any γ, which is exactly what is empirically observed. Although the general upper bound proved in Theorem 3.1 only states convergence in the case ρ < 1 L, we observe rapid convergence of OGDA+ for this example, showcasing that it can drastically outperform EG+ in some scenarios. 6 6 Conclusion Many intriguing questions persist in the domain of min-max problems, particularly when departing from the convex-concave framework. Very recently, it was demonstrated that the O(1/k) bounds on the squared operator norm for EG and OGDA for the last iterate (and not just the best one) are valid even in the negatively comonotone setting. Deriving a comparable statement in the presence of merely weak Minty solutions remains an open question. In general, our analysis and experiments seem to suggest that there is minimal benefit in employing OGDA+ over EG+ for the majority of problems, as the reduced iteration cost is counterbalanced by the smaller step size. An exception is presented by problem (7), which is not covered by theory, and OGDA+ is the only method capable of converging. Finally, we note that the previous paradigm in pure minimization of ""smaller step size ensures convergence"" but ""larger step size gets there faster,"" where the latter is typically constrained by the reciprocal of the gradient’s Lipschitz constant, does not appear to hold true for min-max problems anymore. The analysis of various methods in the presence of weak Minty solutions indicates that convergence can be lost if the step size is excessively small and sometimes needs to be larger than 1 L, which one can typically only hope for in adaptive methods. Our EG+ method with adaptive step size accomplishes this even without the added expense of a backtracking linesearch.article graphicx 7",1,,,,
P015.pdf,"Examining the Convergence of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models: A Quantitative Analysis Abstract Deep generative models, particularly diffusion models, are a significant family within deep learning. This study provides a precise upper limit for the Wasserstein distance between a learned distribution by a diffusion model and the target distribution. In contrast to earlier research, this analysis does not rely on presumptions regarding the learned score function. Furthermore, the findings are applicable to any data-generating distributions within restricted instance spaces, even those lacking a density relative to the Lebesgue measure, and the upper limit is not exponentially dependent on the ambient space dimension. The primary finding expands upon recent research by Mbacke et al. (2023), and the proofs presented are fundamental. 1 Introduction Diffusion models, alongside generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders (VAEs), are among the most influential families of deep generative models. These models have demonstrated remarkable empirical results in generating images and audio, as well as in various other applications. Two primary methods exist for diffusion models: denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-based generative models (SGMs). DDPMs incrementally convert samples from the desired distribution into noise via a forward process, while simultaneously training a backward process to reverse this transformation, enabling the creation of new samples. Conversely, SGMs employ score-matching methods to approximate the score function of the data-generating distribution, subsequently generating new samples through Langevin dynamics. Recognizing that real-world distributions might lack a defined score function, adding varying noise levels to training samples to encompass the entire instance space and training a neural network to concurrently learn the score function for all noise levels has been proposed. Although DDPMs and SGMs may initially seem distinct, it has been demonstrated that DDPMs implicitly approximate the score function, with the sampling process resembling Langevin dynamics. Moreover, a unified perspective of both methods using stochastic differential equations (SDEs) has been derived. The SGM can be viewed as a discretization of Brownian motion, and the DDPM as a discretization of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Consequently, both DDPMs and SGMs are commonly referred to as SGMs in the literature. This explains why prior research investigating the theoretical aspects of diffusion models has adopted the score-based framework, necessitating assumptions about the effectiveness of the learned score function. In this research, a different strategy is employed, applying methods created for VAEs to DDPMs, which can be viewed as hierarchical VAEs with fixed encoders. This method enables the derivation of quantitative, Wasserstein-based upper bounds without making assumptions about the data distribution or the learned score function, and with simple proofs that do not need the SDE toolkit. Furthermore, the bounds presented here do not involve any complex discretization steps, as the forward and backward processes are considered discrete-time from the beginning, rather than being viewed as discretizations of continuous-time processes. 1.1 Related Works There has been an increasing amount of research aimed at providing theoretical findings on the convergence of SGMs. However, these studies frequently depend on restrictive assumptions regarding the data-generating distribution, produce non-quantitative upper bounds, or exhibit exponential dependencies on certain parameters. This work successfully circumvents all three of these limitations. Some bounds are based on very restrictive assumptions about the data-generating distribution, such as log-Sobolev inequalities, which are unrealistic for real-world data distributions. Furthermore, some studies establish upper bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence or the total variation (TV) distance between the data-generating distribution and the distribution learned by the diffusion model; however, unless strong assumptions are made about the support of the data-generating distribution, KL and TV reach their maximum values. Such assumptions arguably do not hold for real-world data-generating distributions, which are widely believed to satisfy the manifold hypothesis. Other work establishes conditions under which the support of the input distribution is equal to the support of the learned distribution, and generalizes the bound to all f-divergences. Assuming L2 accurate score estimation, some establish Wasserstein distance upper bounds under weaker assumptions on the data-generating distribution, but their Wasserstein-based bounds are not quantitative. Quantitative Wasserstein distance upper bounds under the manifold hypothesis have been derived, but these bounds exhibit exponential dependencies on some of the problem parameters. 1.2 Our contributions In this study, strong assumptions about the data-generating distribution are avoided, and a quantitative upper bound on the Wasserstein distance is established without exponential dependencies on problem parameters, including the ambient space dimension. Moreover, a common aspect of the aforementioned studies is that their bounds are contingent on the error of the score estimator. According to some, providing precise guarantees for the estimation of the score function is challenging, as it necessitates an understanding of the non-convex training dynamics of neural network optimization, which is currently beyond reach. Therefore, upper bounds are derived without making assumptions about the learned score function. Instead, the bound presented here is dependent on a reconstruction loss calculated over a finite independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sample. Intuitively, a loss function is defined, which quantifies the average Euclidean distance between a sample from the data-generating distribution and the reconstruction obtained by sampling noise and passing it through the backward process (parameterized by ˘03b8). This method is inspired by previous work on VAEs. This approach offers numerous benefits: it does not impose restrictive assumptions on the data-generating distribution, avoids exponential dependencies on the dimension, and provides a quantitative upper bound based on the Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, this method benefits from utilizing very straightforward and basic proofs. 2 Preliminaries Throughout this paper, lowercase letters are used to represent both probability measures and their densities with respect to the Lebesgue measure, and variables are added in parentheses to enhance readability (e.g., q(xt|xt−1) to denote a time-dependent conditional distribution). An instance space X, which is a subset of RD with the Euclidean distance as the underlying metric, and a target data-generating distribution µ ∈M + 1 (X) are considered. Note that it is not assumed that µ has a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Additionally, || · || represents the Euclidean (L2) norm, and Ep(x) is used as shorthand for Ex∼p(x). Given probability measures p, q ∈M + 1 (X) and a real number k > 1, the Wasserstein distance of order k is defined as (Villani, 2009): Wk(p, q) = inf γ∈Γ(p,q) Z X×X ||x −y||kdγ(x, y) 1/k , where Γ(p, q) denotes the set of couplings of p and q, meaning the set of joint distributions on X × X with respective marginals p and q. The product measure p ⊗q is referred to as the trivial coupling, and the Wasserstein distance of order 1 is simply referred to as the Wasserstein distance. 2.1 Denoising Diffusion Models Instead of employing the SDE framework, diffusion models are presented using the DDPM formulation with discrete-time processes. A diffusion model consists of two discrete-time stochastic processes: a forward process and a backward process. Both processes are indexed by time 0 ≤t ≤T, where the number of time steps T is a predetermined choice. **The forward process.** The forward process transforms a data point x0 ∼µ into a noise distribution q(xT |x0) through a sequence of conditional distributions q(xt|xt−1) for 1 ≤t ≤T. It is assumed that the forward process is defined such that for sufficiently large T, the distribution q(xT |x0) is close to a simple noise distribution p(xT ), which is referred to as the prior distribution. For instance, p(xT ) = N(xT ; 0, I), the standard multivariate normal distribution, has been chosen in previous work. **The backward process.** The backward process is a Markov process with parametric transition kernels. The objective of the backward process is to perform the reverse operation of the forward process: transforming noise samples into (approximate) samples from the distribution µ. Following previous work, it is assumed that the backward process is defined by Gaussian distributions pθ(xt−1|xt) for 2 ≤t ≤T as pθ(xt−1|xt) = N(xt−1; gθ t (xt), σ2 t I), and pθ(x0|x1) = gθ 1(x1), where the variance parameters σ2 t ∈R≥0 are defined by a fixed schedule, the mean functions gθ t : RD →RD are learned using a neural network (with parameters θ) for 2 ≤t ≤T, and gθ 1 : RD →X is a separate function dependent on σ1. In practice, the same network has been used for the functions gθ t for 2 ≤t ≤T, and a separate discrete decoder for gθ 1. 2 Generating new samples from a trained diffusion model is accomplished by sampling xt−1 ∼pθ(xt−1|xt) for 1 ≤t ≤T, starting from a noise vector xT ∼p(xT ) sampled from the prior p(xT ). The following assumption is made regarding the backward process. **Assumption 1.** It is assumed that for each 1 ≤t ≤T, there exists a constant Kθ t > 0 such that for every x1, x2 ∈X, ||gθ t (x1) −gθ t (x2)|| ≤Kθ t ||x1 −x2||. In other words, gθ t is Kθ t -Lipschitz continuous. This assumption is discussed in Remark 3.2. 2.2 Additional Definitions The distribution πθ(·|x0) is defined as πθ(·|x0) = q(xT |x0)pθ(xT −1|xT )pθ(xT −2|xT −1) . . . pθ(x1|x2)pθ(·|x1). Intuitively, for each x0 ∈X, πθ(·|x0) represents the distribution on X obtained by reconstructing samples from q(xT |x0) through the backward process. Another way to interpret this distribution is that for any function f : X →R, the following equation holds: Eπθ(ˆx0|x0)[f(ˆx0)] = Eq(xT |x0)Epθ(xT −1|xT ) . . . Epθ(x1|x2)Epθ(ˆx0|x1)[f(ˆx0)]. Given a finite set S = {x1 0, . . . , xn 0} i.i.d. ∼µ, the regenerated distribution is defined as the following mixture: µθ n = 1 n n X i=1 πθ(·|xi 0). This definition is analogous to the empirical regenerated distribution defined for VAEs. The distribution on X learned by the diffusion model is denoted as πθ(·) and defined as πθ(·) = p(xT )pθ(xT −1|xT )pθ(xT −2|xT −1) . . . pθ(x1|x2)pθ(·|x1). In other words, for any function f : X →R, the expectation of f with respect to πθ(·) is Eπθ(ˆx0)[f(ˆx0)] = Ep(xT )Epθ(xT −1|xT ) . . . Epθ(x1|x2)Epθ(ˆx0|x1)[f(ˆx0)]. Hence, both πθ(·) and πθ(·|x0) are defined using the backward process, with the difference that πθ(·) starts with the prior p(xT ) = N(xT ; 0, I), while πθ(·|x0) starts with the noise distribution q(xT |x0). Finally, the loss function lθ : X × X →R is defined as lθ(xT , x0) = Epθ(xT −1|xT )Epθ(xT −2|xT −1) . . . Epθ(x1|x2)Epθ(ˆx0|x1)[||x0 −ˆx0||]. Hence, given a noise vector xT and a sample x0, the loss lθ(xT , x0) represents the average Euclidean distance between x0 and any sample obtained by passing xT through the backward process. 2.3 Our Approach The goal is to upper-bound the distance W1(µ, πθ(·)). Since the triangle inequality implies W1(µ, πθ(·)) ≤W1(µ, µθ n) + W1(µθ n, πθ(·)), the distance W1(µ, πθ(·)) can be upper-bounded by upper-bounding the two expressions on the right-hand side separately. The upper bound on W1(µ, µθ n) is obtained using a straightforward adaptation of a proof. First, W1(µ, µθ n) is upper-bounded using the expectation of the loss function lθ, then the resulting expression is upper-bounded using a PAC-Bayesian-style expression dependent on the empirical risk and the prior-matching term. The upper bound on the second term W1(µθ n, πθ(·)) uses the definition of µθ n. Intuitively, the difference between πθ(·|xi 0) and πθ(·) is determined by the corresponding initial distributions: q(xT |xi 0) and p(xT ) for πθ(·). Hence, if the two initial distributions are close, and if the steps of the backward process are smooth (see Assumption 1), then πθ(·|xi 0) and πθ(·) are close to each other. 3 3 Main Result 3.1 Theorem Statement We are now ready to present the main result: a quantitative upper bound on the Wasserstein distance between the data-generating distribution µ and the learned distribution πθ(·). **Theorem 3.1.** Assume the instance space X has finite diameter ∆= supx,x′∈X ||x −x′|| < ∞, and let λ > 0 and δ ∈(0, 1) be real numbers. Using the definitions and assumptions of the previous section, the following inequality holds with probability at least 1 −δ over the random draw of S = {x1 0, . . . , xn 0} i.i.d. ∼µ: W1(µ, πθ(·)) ≤1 n n X i=1 Eq(xT |xi 0)[lθ(xT , xi 0)] + 1 λn n X i=1 KL(q(xT |xi 0)||p(xT )) + 1 λn log n δ + λ∆2 8n + T Y t=1 Kθ t ! Eq(xT |xi 0)Ep(yT )[||xT −yT ||] + T X t=2 t−1 Y i=1 Kθ i ! σtEϵ,ϵ′[||ϵ −ϵ′||], where ϵ, ϵ′ ∼N(0, I) are standard Gaussian vectors. **Remark 3.1.** Before presenting the proof, let us discuss Theorem 3.1. * Because the right-hand side of the equation depends on a quantity computed using a finite i.i.d. sample S, the bound holds with high probability with respect to the randomness of S. This is the price we pay for having a quantitative upper bound with no exponential dependencies on problem parameters and no assumptions on the data-generating distribution µ. * The first term of the right-hand side is the average reconstruction loss computed over the sample S = {x1 0, . . . , xn 0}. Note that for each 1 ≤i ≤n, the expectation of lθ(xT |xi 0) is only computed with respect to the noise distribution q(xT |xi 0) defined by xi 0 itself. Hence, this term measures how well a noise vector xT ∼q(xT |xi 0) recovers the original sample xi 0 using the backward process, and averages over the set S = {x1 0, . . . , xn 0}. * If the Lipschitz constants satisfy Kθ t < 1 for all 1 ≤t ≤T, then the larger T is, the smaller the upper bound gets. This is because the product of Kθ t ’s then converges to 0. In Remark 3.2 below, we show that the assumption that Kθ t < 1 for all t is a quite reasonable one. * The hyperparameter λ controls the trade-off between the prior-matching (KL) term and the diameter term ∆2. If Kθ t < 1 for all 1 ≤t ≤T and T →∞, then the convergence of the bound largely depends on the choice of λ. In that case, λ ∝n1/2 leads to faster convergence, while λ ∝n leads to slower convergence to a smaller quantity. This is because the bound stems from PAC-Bayesian theory, where this trade-off is common. * The last term of the equation does not depend on the sample size n. Hence, the upper bound given by Theorem 3.1 does not converge to 0 as n →∞. However, if the Lipschitz factors (Kθ t )1≤t≤T are all less than 1, then this term can be very small, especially in low-dimensional spaces. 3.2 Proof of the main theorem The following result is an adaptation of a previous result. **Lemma 3.2.** Let λ > 0 and δ ∈(0, 1) be real numbers. With probability at least 1 −δ over the randomness of the sample S = {x1 0, . . . , xn 0} i.i.d. ∼µ, the following holds: W1(µ, µθ n) ≤1 n n X i=1 Eq(xT |xi 0)[lθ(xT , xi 0)] + 1 λn n X i=1 KL(q(xT |xi 0)||p(xT )) + 1 λn log n δ + λ∆2 8n . The proof of this result is a straightforward adaptation of a previous proof. Now, let us focus our attention on the second term of the right-hand side of the equation, namely W1(µθ n, πθ(·)). This part is trickier than for VAEs, for which the generative model’s distribution is simply a pushforward measure. Here, we have a non-deterministic sampling process with T steps. Assumption 1 leads to the following lemma on the backward process. **Lemma 3.3.** For any given x1, y1 ∈X, we have Epθ(x0|x1)Epθ(y0|y1)[||x0 −y0||] ≤Kθ 1||x1 −y1||. Moreover, if 2 ≤t ≤T, then for any given xt, yt ∈X, we have 4 Epθ(xt−1|xt)Epθ(yt−1|yt)[||xt−1 −yt−1||] ≤Kθ t ||xt −yt|| + σtEϵ,ϵ′[||ϵ −ϵ′||], where ϵ, ϵ′ ∼N(0, I), meaning Eϵ,ϵ′ is a shorthand for Eϵ,ϵ′∼N(0,I). **Proof.** For the first part, let x1, y1 ∈X. Since according to the equation pθ(x0|x1) = δgθ 1(x1)(x0) and pθ(y0|y1) = δgθ 1(y1)(y0), then Epθ(x0|x1)Epθ(y0|y1)[||x0 −y0||] = ||gθ 1(x1) −gθ 1(y1)|| ≤Kθ 1||x1 −y1||. For the second part, let 2 ≤t ≤T and xt, yt ∈X. Since pθ(xt−1|xt) = N(xt−1; gθ t (xt), σ2 t I), the reparameterization trick implies that sampling xt−1 ∼pθ(xt−1|xt) is equivalent to setting xt−1 = gθ t (xt) + σtϵt, with ϵt ∼N(0, I). Using the above equation, the triangle inequality, and Assumption 1, we obtain Epθ(xt−1|xt)Epθ(yt−1|yt)[||xt−1 −yt−1||] = Eϵt,ϵ′ t∼N(0,I)[||gθ t (xt) + σtϵt −gθ t (yt) −σtϵ′ t||] ≤Eϵt,ϵ′ t∼N(0,I)[||gθ t (xt) −gθ t (yt)||] + σtEϵt,ϵ′ t∼N(0,I)[||ϵt −ϵ′ t||] ≤Kθ t ||xt −yt|| + σtEϵ,ϵ′[||ϵ −ϵ′||], where ϵ, ϵ′ ∼N(0, I). Next, we can use the inequalities of Lemma 3.3 to prove the following result. **Lemma 3.4.** Let T ≥1. The following inequality holds: Epθ(xT −1|xT )Epθ(yT −1|yT )Epθ(xT −2|xT −1)Epθ(yT −2|yT −1) . . . Epθ(x0|x1)Epθ(y0|y1)[||x0 −y0||] ≤ T Y t=1 Kθ t ! ||xT −yT || + T X t=2 t−1 Y i=1 Kθ i ! σtEϵ,ϵ′[||ϵ −ϵ′||], where ϵ, ϵ′ ∼N(0, I). **Proof Idea.** Lemma 3.4 is proven by induction using Lemma 3.3 in the induction step. Using the two previous lemmas, we obtain the following upper bound on W1(µθ n, πθ(·)). **Lemma 3.5.** The following inequality holds: W1(µθ n, πθ(·)) ≤1 n n X i=1 T Y t=1 Kθ t ! Eq(xT |xi 0)Ep(yT )[||xT −yT ||] + T X t=2 t−1 Y i=1 Kθ i ! σtEϵ,ϵ′[||ϵ −ϵ′||], where ϵ, ϵ′ ∼N(0, I). **Proof.** Using the definition of W1, the trivial coupling, the definitions of µθ n and πθ(·), and Lemma 3.4, we get the desired result. Combining Lemmas 3.2 and 3.5 with the triangle inequality yields Theorem 3.1. 3.3 Special case using the forward process of Ho et al. (2020) Theorem 3.1 establishes a general upper bound that holds for any forward process, as long as the backward process satisfies Assumption 1. In this section, we specialize the statement of the theorem to the particular case of the forward process defined in previous work. Let X ⊆RD. The forward process is a Gauss-Markov process with transition densities defined as q(xt|xt−1) = N(xt; √αtxt−1, (1 −αt)I), where α1, . . . , αT is a fixed noise schedule such that 0 < αt < 1 for all t. This definition implies that at each time step 1 ≤t ≤T, 5 q(xt|x0) = N(xt; √¯αtx0, (1 −¯αt)I), with ¯αt = tY i=1 αi. The optimization objective to train the backward process ensures that for each time step t, the distribution pθ(xt−1|xt) remains close to the ground-truth distribution q(xt−1|xt, x0) given by q(xt−1|xt, x0) = N(xt−1; ˜µq t(xt, x0), ˜σ2 t I), where ˜µq t(xt, x0) = √αt(1 −¯αt−1) 1 −¯αt xt + √¯αt−1(1 −αt) 1 −¯αt x0. Now, we discuss Assumption 1 under these definitions. **Remark 3.2.** We can get a glimpse at the range of Kθ t for a trained DDPM by looking at the distribution q(xt−1|xt, x0), since pθ(xt−1|xt) is optimized to be as close as possible to q(xt−1|xt, x0). For a given x0 ∼µ, let us take a look at the Lipschitz norm of x 7→˜µq t(x, x0). Using the above equation, we have ˜µq t(xt, x0) −˜µq t(yt, x0) = √αt(1 −¯αt−1) 1 −¯αt (xt −yt). Hence, x 7→˜µq t(x, x0) is K′ t-Lipschitz continuous with K′ t = √αt(1 −¯αt−1) 1 −¯αt . Now, if αt < 1 for all 1 ≤t ≤T, then we have 1 −¯αt > 1 −¯αt−1, which implies K′ t < 1 for all 1 ≤t ≤T. Remark 3.2 shows that the Lipschitz norm of the mean function ˜µq t(·, x0) does not depend on x0. Indeed, looking at the previous equation, we can see that for any initial x0, the Lipschitz norm K′ t = √αt(1−¯αt−1) 1−¯αt only depends on the noise schedule, not x0 itself. Since gθ t (·, x0) is optimized to match ˜µq t(·, x0) for each x0 in the training set, and all the functions ˜µq t(·, x0) have the same Lipschitz norm K′ t, we believe it is reasonable to assume gθ t is Lipschitz continuous as well. This is the intuition behind Assumption 1. **The prior-matching term.** With the definitions of this section, the prior matching term KL(q(xT |x0)||p(xT )) has the following closed form: KL(q(xT |x0)||p(xT )) = 1 2  −D log(1 −¯αT ) −D¯αT + ¯αT ||x0||2 . **Upper-bounds on the average distance between Gaussian vectors.** If ϵ, ϵ′ are D-dimensional vectors sampled from N(0, I), then Eϵ,ϵ′[||ϵ −ϵ′||] ≤ √ 2D. Moreover, since q(xT |x0) = N(xT ; √¯αT x0, (1 −¯αT )I) and the prior p(yT ) = N(yT ; 0, I), Eq(xT |x0)Ep(yT )[||xT −yT ||] ≤ p ¯αT ||x0||2 + (2 −¯αT )D. **Special case of the main theorem.** With the definitions of this section, the inequality of Theorem 3.1 implies that with probability at least 1 −δ over the randomness of {x1 0, . . . , x 6",1,,,,
P016.pdf,"A Bayesian Perspective on Cross-Cultural Morality: Investigating Astrobiological and Cognitive Dimensions Abstract Bayesian Theology for Extra-Terrestrial Diplomacy explores the potential for meaningful interactions with extraterrestrial civilizations by integrating Bayesian inference and theological inquiry. This novel approach establishes a probabilistic framework to evaluate the compatibility of ethical systems across planetary cultures, focusing on shared moral frameworks as the foundation for interstellar diplomacy. By combining Bayesian analysis with philosophical perspectives, the study aims to uncover common moral structures that could enable cooperative and mutually beneficial relationships. The framework draws insights from diverse disciplines like astrobiology, exopale- ontology, and extremophile studies to predict moral systems influenced by varied environmental conditions. Bayesian models applied to hypothetical alien encoun- ters systematically evaluate risks, benefits, and strategic protocols for interspecies diplomacy. This interdisciplinary research also examines the nature of morality and its role in interspecies communication. The inclusion of theological perspectives enriches the analysis, offering a multifaceted exploration of ethical implications in intergalactic contexts. Ultimately, this study pushes the boundaries of interdisciplinary inquiry, providing a rigorous, nuanced framework for addressing the moral complexities of interstellar cooperation while challenging our assumptions about humanity’s place in the universe. 1 Introduction The pursuit of understanding the intricacies of extra-terrestrial life and its potential implications on human society has long been a topic of fascination and debate. As we continue to advance in our search for life beyond Earth, it is becoming increasingly evident that the discovery of alien civilizations could have profound effects on our collective worldview, challenging our existing beliefs and moral frameworks. In light of this, it is essential to consider the role of Bayesian theology in facilitating a deeper understanding of the potential for shared moral frameworks with alien civilizations. By employing Bayesian inference, we can systematically analyze the likelihood of encountering extraterrestrial life that adheres to a similar moral compass as humanity, thereby enabling more effective and meaningful diplomatic interactions. The concept of a shared moral framework is inherently complex, as it relies on a multitude of factors, including the aliens’ cognitive abilities, cultural background, and environmental influences. Moreover, the possibility of encountering a civilization with a completely disparate moral framework raises questions about the universality of ethical principles and the potential for intergalactic cooperation. It is within this context that Bayesian theology emerges as a vital tool, allowing us to quantify the uncertainty associated with these encounters and subsequently inform our diplomatic strategies. One approach to tackling this problem involves the development of a moral framework taxonomy, which would categorize various ethical systems based on their underlying principles and values. This taxonomy could then be used to construct a Bayesian network, enabling the inference of probability distributions over the possible moral frameworks that an alien civilization might adhere to. However, this approach is not without its challenges, as it relies on a deeper understanding of the moral and philosophical underpinnings of human civilization, as well as the potential for alternative moral frameworks that may be incomprehensible to humanity. An alternative, albeit unconventional, approach to this problem involves the application of Jungian analytical psychology, which posits the existence of a collective unconscious that transcends human culture and experience. According to this perspective, certain archetypes and moral principles may be universally shared across the cosmos, providing a common foundation for intergalactic diplomacy. This idea is supported by the premise that many human myths and legends contain themes and motifs that are eerily similar, despite being developed in isolation from one another. It is possible that these shared archetypes may serve as a cosmic moral lingua franca, facilitating communication and cooperation between human and alien civilizations. Furthermore, recent advances in the field of astrobiology have led to a greater understanding of the conditions necessary for life to emerge and thrive on other planets. The discovery of exoplanets with environments similar to those of Earth has sparked hope that we may soon encounter life beyond our solar system. However, this also raises questions about the potential for moral frameworks to evolve in response to different environmental pressures. For instance, a civilization that develops on a planet with scarce resources may be more likely to adopt a utilitarian moral framework, whereas a civilization that evolves in a resource-rich environment may be more inclined towards a deontological approach. In addition to these considerations, it is also essential to examine the potential implications of encountering an alien civilization with a moral framework that is fundamentally at odds with our own. This could lead to a range of complex diplomatic and ethical dilemmas, as humanity would be forced to confront the possibility that its own moral assumptions may not be universal. Moreover, the encounter could also raise questions about the nature of morality itself, challenging our existing understanding of right and wrong and potentially leading to a reevaluation of human values and principles. The integration of Bayesian theology and astrobiology also raises interesting questions about the potential for a ""moral cosmology,"" which would seek to understand the underlying moral principles that govern the universe. This could involve the development of a new field of study, one that combines insights from theology, philosophy, and astrobiology to provide a deeper understanding of the cosmos and our place within it. By exploring the moral implications of astrobiological discoveries, we may uncover new avenues for inquiry and new perspectives on the human condition, ultimately leading to a more nuanced and informed approach to intergalactic diplomacy. Moreover, the prospect of encountering alien civilizations with disparate moral frameworks also prompts us to reexamine our own moral assumptions and the values that underlie human society. This could involve a critical evaluation of our existing moral principles, as well as an exploration of alternative ethical systems that may be more conducive to intergalactic cooperation. Ultimately, the development of a Bayesian theological framework for extra-terrestrial diplomacy will require a multidisciplinary approach, one that draws on insights from theology, philosophy, astrobiology, and economics to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex moral and ethical issues at play. The application of Bayesian inference to the problem of inferring shared moral frameworks with alien civilizations also raises intriguing questions about the nature of probability and uncertainty in the context of intergalactic diplomacy. By quantifying the uncertainty associated with these encounters, we may uncover new insights into the potential for cooperation and conflict, as well as the moral and ethical implications of our actions. This could involve the development of new probabilistic models and algorithms, ones that are specifically designed to address the unique challenges and uncertainties of intergalactic diplomacy. In conclusion, the exploration of Bayesian theology and its application to extra-terrestrial diplomacy represents a fascinating and complex area of inquiry, one that challenges our existing understanding of morality, ethics, and the cosmos. As we continue to advance in our search for life beyond Earth, it is essential that we develop a deeper understanding of the potential for shared moral frameworks with alien civilizations, and that we establish a framework for intergalactic diplomacy that is informed by a nuanced and multifaceted approach to morality and ethics. By doing so, we may uncover new 2 avenues for cooperation and mutual understanding, ultimately leading to a more harmonious and peaceful universe. 2 Related Work The concept of Bayesian theology for extra-terrestrial diplomacy is a multifaceted and interdisciplinary field that has garnered significant attention in recent years. At its core, this field seeks to develop a probabilistic framework for understanding the potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations. This endeavor is inherently complex, as it requires an integration of insights from theology, astrobiology, philosophy, and diplomacy, among other disciplines. One of the foundational challenges in this field is the development of a rigorous methodology for inferring the probability of shared moral frameworks. This requires a deep understanding of the philosophical and theological underpinnings of human morality, as well as a willingness to consider the possibility of alternative moral frameworks that may be employed by alien civilizations. Some researchers have proposed the use of Bayesian inference techniques, which provide a probabilistic framework for updating beliefs based on new evidence. However, the application of these techniques to the field of extra-terrestrial diplomacy is still in its infancy, and significant work remains to be done in order to develop a robust and reliable methodology. In addition to the methodological challenges, there are also significant theoretical and conceptual hurdles that must be overcome. For example, the concept of morality is often closely tied to the specific cultural and historical context of a given civilization. As such, it is possible that alien civilizations may possess moral frameworks that are fundamentally incompatible with our own. This raises important questions about the potential for moral relativism, and the extent to which human morality can be considered universal. Some researchers have argued that the discovery of extraterrestrial life could challenge our current understanding of morality, and potentially lead to a re-evaluation of our values and principles. Despite these challenges, there have been several notable attempts to develop a framework for understanding the potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations. One approach that has garnered significant attention is the use of game theoretical models, which provide a mathematical framework for analyzing the strategic interactions between different agents. These models have been used to study a wide range of scenarios, from the evolution of cooperation to the emergence of conflict. However, their application to the field of extra-terrestrial diplomacy is still highly speculative, and significant work remains to be done in order to develop a rigorous and reliable framework for predicting the behavior of alien civilizations. Another approach that has been proposed is the use of anthropological and sociological insights to understand the potential for shared moral frameworks. This approach recognizes that human morality is shaped by a complex array of cultural, historical, and environmental factors, and seeks to identify potential parallels and analogies with alien civilizations. For example, some researchers have argued that the emergence of complex social structures and cooperative behaviors in certain animal species may provide insights into the potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations. However, this approach is still highly speculative, and significant work remains to be done in order to develop a rigorous and reliable framework for understanding the potential for shared moral frameworks. In a bizarre and unexpected twist, some researchers have also proposed the use of psychedelic substances as a means of facilitating communication and understanding between human and alien civilizations. The idea behind this approach is that psychedelic substances can alter human perception and consciousness in ways that may facilitate a deeper understanding of alternative moral frameworks and modes of cognition. While this approach is certainly unorthodox, it has garnered significant attention and interest in certain quarters, and may potentially provide a novel and innovative means of facilitating communication and understanding between human and alien civilizations. Furthermore, the concept of Bayesian theology for extra-terrestrial diplomacy also raises important questions about the potential for moral and ethical implications of encountering alien civilizations. For example, if we were to encounter an alien civilization that possesses a fundamentally incompatible moral framework, would we be morally obligated to attempt to communicate and understand their 3 perspective, or would we be justified in prioritizing our own moral and ethical principles? These are complex and difficult questions, and ones that require careful consideration and analysis. In addition, the potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations also raises important questions about the concept of universal morality. If we were to discover that certain moral principles are universal and shared across multiple civilizations, would this provide evidence for the existence of a universal moral law, or would it simply reflect the fact that certain moral principles are highly adaptable and useful in a wide range of contexts? These are important questions, and ones that require careful consideration and analysis. Moreover, the field of Bayesian theology for extra-terrestrial diplomacy also intersects with the field of astrobiology, which seeks to understand the potential for life to exist elsewhere in the universe. The discovery of exoplanets and the detection of biosignatures in the atmospheres of certain planets have provided significant evidence for the potential for life to exist elsewhere in the universe. However, the existence of life does not necessarily imply the existence of intelligent life, or the potential for shared moral frameworks. As such, significant work remains to be done in order to develop a rigorous and reliable framework for understanding the potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations. The potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations also raises important questions about the concept of morality and its relationship to the universe. For example, if we were to discover that certain moral principles are universal and shared across multiple civilizations, would this provide evidence for the existence of a moral law that is inherent in the universe itself, or would it simply reflect the fact that certain moral principles are highly adaptable and useful in a wide range of contexts? These are important questions, and ones that require careful consideration and analysis. Additionally, the field of Bayesian theology for extra-terrestrial diplomacy also intersects with the field of philosophy, which seeks to understand the nature of reality and our place within it. The potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations raises important questions about the nature of morality and its relationship to the universe. For example, if we were to discover that certain moral principles are universal and shared across multiple civilizations, would this provide evidence for the existence of a moral law that is inherent in the universe itself, or would it simply reflect the fact that certain moral principles are highly adaptable and useful in a wide range of contexts? These are important questions, and ones that require careful consideration and analysis. In another unexpected turn, some researchers have also proposed the use of fringe sciences, such as ufology and cryptozoology, as a means of understanding the potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations. The idea behind this approach is that these fields may provide insights into the potential for alternative forms of life and consciousness that may exist elsewhere in the universe. While this approach is certainly unorthodox, it has garnered significant attention and interest in certain quarters, and may potentially provide a novel and innovative means of facilitating communication and understanding between human and alien civilizations. The potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations also raises important questions about the concept of cultural relativism. If we were to encounter an alien civilization that possesses a fundamentally incompatible moral framework, would we be morally obligated to attempt to understand and respect their perspective, or would we be justified in prioritizing our own moral and ethical principles? These are complex and difficult questions, and ones that require careful consideration and analysis. In a surprising development, some researchers have also proposed the use of artificial intelligence as a means of facilitating communication and understanding between human and alien civilizations. The idea behind this approach is that artificial intelligence may provide a means of transcending the limitations of human language and cognition, and facilitating a deeper understanding of alternative moral frameworks and modes of cognition. While this approach is still highly speculative, it has garnered significant attention and interest in certain quarters, and may potentially provide a novel and innovative means of facilitating communication and understanding between human and alien civilizations. The potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations also intersects with the field of diplomacy, which seeks to understand the potential for cooperation and conflict between different nations and civilizations. The discovery of extraterrestrial life could potentially lead to a fundamentally new era of diplomacy, as human civilizations seek to navigate the complexities of 4 interspecies communication and cooperation. However, this would also raise important questions about the potential for moral and ethical implications of encountering alien civilizations, and the need for a rigorous and reliable framework for understanding the potential for shared moral frameworks. In a bizarre and unexpected tangent, some researchers have also proposed the use ofCrop circles as a means of facilitating communication and understanding between human and alien civilizations. The idea behind this approach is that crop circles may provide a means of non-verbal communication, and facilitate a deeper understanding of alternative moral frameworks and modes of cognition. While this approach is certainly unorthodox, it has garnered significant attention and interest in certain quarters, and may potentially provide a novel and innovative means of facilitating communication and understanding between human and alien civilizations. The concept of Bayesian theology for extra-terrestrial diplomacy is a complex and multifaceted field that requires an integration of insights from theology, astrobiology, philosophy, and diplomacy, among other disciplines. While significant work remains to be done in order to develop a rigorous and reliable framework for understanding the potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations, the potential rewards are significant. The discovery of extraterrestrial life could potentially lead to a fundamentally new era of cooperation and understanding between human and alien civilizations, and could provide important insights into the nature of morality and its relationship to the universe. As such, continued research and exploration in this field is essential, and may potentially lead to a deeper understanding of the complexities and mysteries of the universe. Furthermore, it is also essential to consider the potential implications of encountering alien civiliza- tions that possess advanced technologies and capabilities. For example, if an alien civilization were to possess technology that is significantly more advanced than our own, would we be morally obligated to attempt to learn from them and adapt their technologies, or would we be justified in prioritizing our own technological development and autonomy? These are complex and difficult questions, and ones that require careful consideration and analysis. 3 Methodology To develop a comprehensive framework for Bayesian Theology in the context of Extra-Terrestrial Diplomacy, we first established a foundational understanding of the theological and philosophical underpinnings of moral frameworks across potential alien civilizations. This involved an exhaustive review of terrestrial religious and ethical systems, seeking commonalities and divergences that could inform our hypotheses about extraterrestrial moralities. We hypothesized that any civilization advanced enough to communicate with us would have grappled with similar fundamental questions regarding the nature of existence, the balance between individual and collective well-being, and the role of altruism versus self-preservation. A critical component of our methodology was the development of a novel Bayesian inference engine, which we term ""Xenothetic Inference Module"" (XIM). The XIM is designed to integrate disparate data streams, including but not limited to: astrobiological findings, the spectral analysis of exoplanetary atmospheres, patterns in celestial mechanics that could indicate the presence of megastructures, and even the detection of mathematical or linguistic patterns in purported alien transmissions. By continuously updating its probabilistic models based on new evidence, the XIM aims to estimate the likelihood of encountering civilizations with moral frameworks that overlap with our own, facilitating more effective and ethical communication strategies. In an unexpected turn, our research also explored the potential application of quantum entanglement as a means of interstellar communication that could bypass traditional limitations imposed by the speed of light. Theoretically, entangled particles could serve as a conduit for instantaneous information exchange, regardless of spatial separation. This led us down a fascinating, albeit highly speculative, path considering the implications of quantum non-locality on the nature of interstellar morality and cooperation. We posited that civilizations capable of harnessing entanglement for communication might develop unique ethical perspectives, given the fundamentally non-local character of their interconnectedness. Furthermore, our team conducted an extensive survey of science fiction literature and cinema, analyzing depictions of alien civilizations and their moral structures. This may seem unconventional, but we reasoned that speculative fiction often serves as a reflection of human hopes, fears, and 5 philosophical introspections about our place in the universe. By examining the diversity of imagined extraterrestrial societies and their ethical dilemmas, we aimed to catalog a wide range of possible moral frameworks that could exist elsewhere in the universe. This approach, termed ""narrative anthropology,"" allowed us to consider scenarios that might not be immediately apparent through more traditional scientific or theological inquiry. Moreover, we invested significant effort into developing a taxonomy of potential alien value sys- tems, categorizing them based on their putative ethical, utilitarian, deontological, or virtue-based orientations. This classification scheme, while not exhaustive, provided a structured framework for predicting how different types of civilizations might interact with humanity, based on their inferred moral principles. An intriguing outcome of this work was the realization that certain forms of alien life, particularly those with collective or hive-minded consciousness, might adopt moral frameworks that are incommensurable with human ethical discourse, challenging our assumptions about the universality of moral values. In a bold, albeit somewhat unorthodox, move, our research team also collaborated with a group of experimental artists to create an ""interstellar moral probe"" – a transcendent, symbolic representation of human ethics and values embedded within a cosmic ray-based transmission. The rationale behind this artistic endeavor was to explore the boundaries of moral expression and recognition across vastly different cultural and biological contexts. By broadcasting an essence of human morality into the cosmos, we hoped to stimulate a form of ""moral resonance"" that could, in theory, be detected or responded to by civilizations attuned to similar ethical frequencies. Through these multifaceted approaches, our study endeavored to bridge the gap between the scientific pursuit of extraterrestrial life and the philosophical exploration of moral universalism. By synthesizing insights from theology, ethics, astrobiology, and quantum mechanics, we sought to illuminate the intricate, uncharted landscape of interstellar morality, navigating toward a deeper understanding of the shared moral frameworks that might unite intelligent life across the cosmos. Ultimately, our methodology, though eclectic and provocative, underscores the profound complexity and richness of exploring the moral dimensions of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. 4 Experiments In an effort to operationalize the conceptual framework of Bayesian Theology for Extra-Terrestrial Diplomacy, a series of experiments were conducted to infer the probability of shared moral frame- works with alien civilizations. The methodology employed a multi-faceted approach, incorporating elements of astrobiology, cognitive psychology, and philosophical theology. Initially, a comprehen- sive review of existing literature on the Fermi Paradox, the Drake Equation, and the Zoo Hypothesis was undertaken to contextualize the research within the broader discourse of extraterrestrial life and its potential implications for human society. This was supplemented by an exhaustive analy- sis of mythological and theological narratives from diverse cultural traditions, seeking to identify commonalities and divergences in the moral and ethical frameworks underpinning these stories. To further ground the research in empirical data, a mixed-methods survey was administered to a sample of 10,000 individuals, representing a cross-section of the global population in terms of demographic variables such as age, gender, geographical location, and socio-economic status. The survey instrument consisted of a combination of Likert scale questions, open-ended prompts, and a novel ""Moral Dilemma Resolution"" task, which presented participants with a series of hypothetical scenarios involving conflicts between individual rights and collective well-being, and asked them to provide narrative responses detailing their decision-making processes. The data generated from this survey were then subjected to a Bayesian analysis, utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations to estimate the posterior distributions of parameters representing the probability of shared moral values among humans and, by extension, potentially among alien civilizations. An unexpected tangent emerged during the data collection phase, as a subgroup of participants began to report experiences of ""moral downloading,"" whereby they claimed to have received intuitive insights into the moral frameworks of hypothetical alien civilizations. These reports were characterized by a sense of immediacy and certainty, with participants often describing the experience as akin to accessing a collective unconscious or tapping into a cosmic reservoir of moral knowledge. While these claims were not anticipated at the outset of the study, they were nonetheless incorporated into 6 the analysis, with a separate MCMC model developed to estimate the probability of such ""moral downloading"" events occurring within the context of human-alien interactions. A bizarre approach was also adopted in the form of a ""simulated alien encounter"" protocol, wherein participants were immersed in a virtual reality environment designed to mimic the conditions of a hypothetical first contact scenario. Within this virtual environment, participants were presented with a series of moral dilemmas tailored to the specific context of interstellar relations, such as the management of resources, the resolution of conflicts, and the balancing of individual freedoms with collective security. The responses generated by participants during these simulated encounters were then analyzed using a combination of natural language processing and thematic analysis, aiming to identify patterns and themes that could inform the development of a shared moral framework for human-alien diplomacy. In an effort to further validate the findings, a table was constructed to summarize the results of the survey and the simulated alien encounter protocol, as shown below: The estimates presented in this Table 1: Probability Estimates of Shared Moral Values among Humans and Alien Civilizations Moral Value Human-Human Human-Alien (Simulated) Human-Alien (Moral Downloading) Respect for Life 0.85 0.62 0.81 Cooperation 0.78 0.58 0.75 Fairness 0.82 0.65 0.80 Individual Rights 0.75 0.55 0.70 Collective Well-being 0.80 0.60 0.78 table suggest that, while there may be some degree of overlap in the moral values held by humans and hypothetical alien civilizations, there are also significant discrepancies and uncertainties that must be accounted for in the development of a shared moral framework for interstellar diplomacy. Furthermore, the inclusion of ""moral downloading"" events in the analysis appears to have introduced a degree of instability into the estimates, highlighting the need for further research into the nature and implications of such phenomena. The experiments also involved an examination of the role of ritual and symbolism in facilitating human-alien communication and cooperation. A series of ""inter Species Rituals"" were designed and implemented, incorporating elements of music, dance, and visual art to convey moral and ethical principles in a universally intelligible language. The results of these experiments were mixed, with some participants reporting a sense of profound connection and understanding with the hypothetical alien entities, while others experienced confusion, disorientation, or even a sense of moral outrage. These findings underscore the complexity and unpredictability of interstellar relations, and highlight the need for a nuanced and multi-faceted approach to the development of a shared moral framework for human-alien diplomacy. In addition to these experimental protocols, a range of secondary analyses were conducted to explore the implications of the research for our understanding of the human condition and the potential for moral growth and evolution in the context of interstellar relations. These analyses involved the application of theoretical frameworks from fields such as cognitive science, anthropology, and philosophy, and aimed to shed light on the deeper structural and existential implications of the research findings. The results of these analyses are presented in the following sections, and are intended to contribute to a broader conversation about the nature and significance of Bayesian Theology for Extra-Terrestrial Diplomacy. 5 Results The investigation into the probability of shared moral frameworks with alien civilizations has yielded a plethora of intriguing results, warranting a nuanced and multifaceted examination. Initially, our research endeavors focused on establishing a foundational framework for Bayesian inference in the context of interstellar diplomacy. This involved the development of a novel probabilistic model, herein referred to as the ""Interstellar Moral Alignment"" (IMA) model, which seeks to quantify the likelihood of convergent moral values between human and extraterrestrial civilizations. 7 The IMA model is predicated on the assumption that the emergence of complex life and, subsequently, moral frameworks, is influenced by a combination of universal principles and contingent factors. By integrating insights from astrophysics, astrobiology, and the philosophy of morality, we have endeavored to create a comprehensive",,,,,

P017.pdf,"Detecting and Summarizing Video Highlights with Lag-Calibration Abstract The increasing popularity of video sharing has led to a growing need for automatic video analysis, including highlight detection. Emerging platforms that feature crowdsourced, time-synchronized video comments offer a valuable resource for identifying video highlights. However, this task presents several challenges: (1) time-synchronized comments often lag behind their corresponding shots; (2) these comments are frequently sparse and contain noise semantically; and (3) determining which shots constitute highlights is inherently subjective. This paper introduces a novel framework designed to address these challenges. The proposed method uses concept-mapped lexical chains to calibrate the lag in comments, models video highlights based on comment intensity and the combined concentration of emotion and concept within each shot, and summarizes detected highlights using an enhanced SumBasic algorithm that incorporates emotion and concept mapping. Experiments conducted on extensive real-world datasets demonstrate that our highlight detection and summarization methods substantially outperform existing benchmark techniques. 1 Introduction Billions of hours of video content are viewed daily on platforms like YouTube, with mobile devices accounting for half of these views. This surge in video sharing has intensified the demand for efficient video analysis. Consider a scenario where a user wishes to quickly grasp the essence of a lengthy video without manually navigating through it. Automatically generated highlights would enable users to digest the video’s key moments in a matter of minutes, aiding their decision on whether to watch the full video later. Furthermore, automated video highlight detection and summarization can significantly enhance video indexing, search, and recommendation systems. However, extracting highlights from a video is a complex task. Firstly, the perception of a ""highlight"" can vary significantly among individuals. Secondly, analyzing low-level features such as image, audio, and motion may not always capture the essence of a highlight. The absence of high-level semantic information poses a significant limitation to highlight detection in conventional video processing. The recent emergence of crowdsourced, time-synchronized video comments, also known as ""bullet- screen comments,"" presents a new avenue for highlight detection. These real-time comments, which appear overlaid on the video screen, are synchronized with the video frames. This phenomenon has gained widespread popularity on platforms like niconico in Japan, Bilibili and Acfun in China, and YouTube Live and Twitch Live in the USA. The prevalence of time-synchronized comments offers a unique opportunity for leveraging natural language processing in video highlight detection. Nevertheless, using time-synchronized comments for highlight detection and labeling still poses significant challenges. Primarily, there is an almost unavoidable delay between comments and their corresponding shots. As illustrated in Figure 1, discussions about a particular shot may continue into subsequent shots. Highlight detection and labeling without accounting for this lag may yield inaccurate outcomes. Secondly, time-synchronized comments are often semantically sparse, both in terms of the number of comments per shot and the number of words per comment. This sparsity can hinder the performance of traditional bag-of-words statistical models. Thirdly, determining highlights in an unsupervised manner, without prior knowledge, involves considerable uncertainty. The defining characteristics of highlights must be clearly defined, captured, and modeled to ensure accurate detection. To our knowledge, limited research has focused on unsupervised highlight detection and labeling using time-synchronized comments. The most relevant work in this area proposes detecting highlights based on the topic concentration derived from semantic vectors of bullet-comments, and labeling each highlight using a pre-trained classifier based on predefined tags. However, we contend that emotion concentration holds greater significance than general topic concentration in highlight detection. Another study suggests extracting highlights based on the frame-by-frame similarity of emotion distributions. However, neither of these approaches addresses the combined challenges of lag calibration, balancing emotion-topic concentration, and unsupervised highlight labeling. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes the following solutions: (1) employ word-to- concept and word-to-emotion mapping based on global word embedding, enabling the construction of lexical chains for calibrating the lag in bullet-comments; (2) detect highlights based on the emotional and conceptual concentration and intensity of the lag-calibrated bullet-comments; and (3) summarize highlights using a modified Basic Sum algorithm that considers emotions and concepts as fundamental units within a bullet-comment. The main contributions of this research are as follows: (1) We introduce a completely unsupervised framework for detecting and summarizing video highlights using time-synchronized comments; (2) We introduce a lag-calibration method that uses concept-mapped lexical chains; (3) We have created extensive datasets for bullet-comment word embedding, an emotion lexicon tailored for bullet-comments, and ground-truth data for evaluating highlight detection and labeling based on bullet-comments. 2 Related Work 2.1 Highlight detection by video processing Following the definition from previous research, we define highlights as the most memorable shots in a video characterized by high emotional intensity. It’s important to note that highlight detection differs from video summarization. While video summarization aims to provide a condensed representation of a video’s storyline, highlight detection focuses on extracting its emotionally impactful content. In the realm of highlight detection, some researchers have proposed representing video emotions as a curve on the arousal-valence plane, utilizing low-level features such as motion, vocal effects, shot length, and audio pitch, or color, along with mid-level features like laughter and subtitles. However, due to the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level semantics, the accuracy of highlight detection based solely on video processing is limited. 2.2 Temporal text summarization Research on temporal text summarization shares similarities with the present study but also exhibits key distinctions. Several works have approached temporal text summarization as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem, a graph optimization problem, a supervised learning-to-rank problem, and as an online clustering problem. This study models highlight detection as a simpler two-objective optimization problem with specific constraints. However, the features employed to assess the ""highlightness"" of a shot diverge from those used in the aforementioned studies. Given that highlight shots are observed to correlate with high emotional intensity and topic concentration, coverage and non-redundancy are not primary optimization goals, as they are in temporal text summarization. Instead, our focus is on modeling emotional and topic concentration within the context of this study. 2.3 Crowdsourced time-sync comment mining Several studies have explored the use of crowdsourced time-synchronized comments for tagging videos on a shot-by-shot basis. These approaches involve manual labeling and supervised training, 2 temporal and personalized topic modeling, or tagging the video as a whole. One work proposes generating a summarization for each shot through data reconstruction that jointly considers textual and topic levels. One work proposed a centroid-diffusion algorithm to identify highlights. Shots are represented by latent topics found through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Another method suggests using pre- trained semantic vectors of comments to cluster them into topics and subsequently identify highlights based on topic concentration. Additionally, they utilize predefined labels to train a classifier for highlight labeling. The current study differs from these two studies in several ways. First, before performing highlight detection, we apply a lag-calibration step to mitigate inaccuracies caused by comment delays. Second, we represent each scene using a combination of topic and emotion concentration. Third, we perform both highlight detection and labeling in an unsupervised manner. 2.4 Lexical chain Lexical chains represent sequences of words that exhibit a cohesive relationship spanning multiple sentences. Early work on lexical chains used syntactic relationships of words from Roget’s Thesaurus, without considering word sense disambiguation. Subsequent research expanded lexical chains by incorporating WordNet relations and word sense disambiguation. Lexical chains are also built utilizing word-embedded relations for disambiguating multi-word expressions. This study constructs lexical chains for accurate lag calibration, leveraging global word embedding. 3 Problem Formulation The problem addressed in this paper can be formulated as follows: The input consists of a set of time-synchronized comments, denoted as C = {c1, c2, c3, . . . , cn}, along with their correspond- ing timestamps T = {t1, t2, t3, . . . , tn} for a given video v. We are also given a compression ratio ρhighlight that determines the number of highlights to be generated, and a compression ratio ρsummary that specifies the number of comments to be included in each highlight summary. Our objective is twofold: (1) to generate a set of highlight shots S(v) = {s1, s2, s3, . . . , sm}, and (2) to produce highlight summaries Σ(v) = {C1, C2, C3, . . . , Cm} that closely align with the ground truth. Each highlight summary Ci comprises a subset of the comments associated with that shot: Ci = {c1, c2, c3, . . . , ck}. The number of highlight shots m and the number of comments in each summary k are determined by ρhighlight and ρsummary, respectively. 4 Video Highlight Detection This section introduces our proposed framework for detecting video highlights. We also describe two preliminary tasks: constructing a global word embedding for time-synchronized comments and building an emotion lexicon. 4.1 Preliminaries Word-Embedding of Time-Sync Comments As previously highlighted, a key challenge in analyzing time-synchronized comments is their semantic sparsity, stemming from the limited number of comments and their brevity. Two semantically related words might not appear related if they don’t co-occur frequently within a single video. To address this, we construct a global word embedding based on a large collection of time-synchronized comments. This word-embedding dictionary can be represented as: D = {(w1 : v1), (w2 : v2), . . . , (wn : vn)}, where wi is a word, vi is its corresponding word vector, and n is the vocabulary size of the corpus. Emotion Lexicon Construction Extracting emotions from time-synchronized comments is crucial for highlight detection, as em- phasized earlier. However, traditional emotion lexicons are not directly applicable in this context due to the prevalence of internet slang specific to these platforms. For example, ""23333"" signifies laughter (""ha ha ha""), and ""6666"" expresses admiration (""really awesome""). Therefore, we construct an emotion lexicon tailored for time-synchronized comments, derived from the word-embedding 3 dictionary generated in the previous step. We begin by manually labeling words corresponding to the five basic emotion categories (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and surprise) as seeds, selecting from the most frequent words in the corpus. The sixth emotion category, ""disgust,"" is omitted due to its rarity in the dataset but can be easily incorporated for other datasets. We then expand this emotion lexicon by identifying the top N neighbors of each seed word in the word-embedding space. A neighbor is added to the seeds if it meets a minimum percentage of overlap θoverlap with all seeds, with a minimum similarity score of simmin. Neighbors are determined based on cosine similarity within the word-embedding space. 4.2 Lag-Calibration This section details our method for lag calibration, which involves concept mapping, constructing word-embedded lexical chains, and performing the actual calibration. Concept Mapping To tackle semantic sparsity in time-synchronized comments and build lexical chains of semantically related words, we first map words with similar meanings to the same concept. Given a set of comments C for a video v, we define a mapping F from the vocabulary VC of comments C to a set of concepts KC: F : VC →KC (|VC| ≥|KC|) Specifically, the mapping F assigns each word wi to a concept k = F(wi) as follows: F(wi) = F(w1) = F(w2) = . . . = F(wtop_n) = k, ∃k ∈KC s.t. {w|w ∈top_n(wi) ∧F(w) = k}/|top_n(wi)| ≥θoverlap top_n(wi) returns the n nearest neighbors of word wi based on cosine similarity. For each word wi in the comments C, we examine the percentage of its neighbors that have already been mapped to a concept k. If this percentage exceeds the threshold θoverlap, then word wi and its neighbors are mapped to concept k. Otherwise, they are assigned to a new concept, represented by wi itself. Lexical Chain Construction The next step involves constructing all lexical chains present in the time-synchronized comments for video v. This enables the calibration of lagged comments based on these chains. A lexical chain lik consists of a set of triples lik = {(w, t, c)}, where w is the actual word mentioned for concept k in comment c, and t is the timestamp of comment c. We create a lexical chain dictionary LC for the time-synchronized comments C of video v: LC = {k1 : (l11, l12, l13, . . .), k2 : (l21, l22, l23, . . .), . . . , kn : (ln1, ln2, ln3, . . .)} where ki ∈KC represents a concept, and lik is the i-th lexical chain associated with concept k. The procedure for constructing these lexical chains is detailed in Algorithm 1. Specifically, each comment in C can either be appended to an existing lexical chain or added to a new, empty chain. This decision is based on the comment’s temporal distance from existing chains, controlled by the maximum silence parameter tsilence. It’s important to note that word senses within the constructed lexical chains are not disambiguated, unlike in most traditional algorithms. However, we argue that these lexical chains remain useful because our concept mapping is built from time-synchronized comments in their natural order. This progressive semantic continuity naturally reinforces similar word senses for temporally close comments. This continuity, combined with global word embedding, ensures the validity of our concept mapping in most scenarios. Comment Lag-Calibration With the lexical chain dictionary LC constructed, we can now calibrate the comments in C based on their respective lexical chains. Our observations indicate that the initial comment pertaining to a shot typically occurs within that shot, while subsequent comments may not. Therefore, we adjust the timestamp of each comment to match the timestamp of the first element within its corresponding lexical chain. If a comment belongs to multiple lexical chains (concepts), we select the chain with the highest score scorechain. The scorechain is calculated as the sum of the frequencies of each word 4 in the chain, weighted by the logarithm of their global frequencies, denoted as log(D(w).count). Consequently, each comment will be assigned to its most semantically significant lexical chain (concept) for calibration. The calibration algorithm is presented in Algorithm 2. It’s worth noting that if multiple consecutive shots, {s1, s2, . . . , sn}, contain comments with similar content, our lag-calibration method might shift many comments from shots s2, s3, . . . , sn to the timestamp of the first shot, s1, if these comments are connected through lexical chains originating from s1. This is not necessarily a drawback, as it helps us avoid selecting redundant consecutive highlight shots and allows for the inclusion of other potential highlights, given a fixed compression ratio. 4.3 Shot Importance Scoring In this section, we first segment comments into shots of equal temporal length, denoted as tshot. We then model the importance of each shot, enabling highlight detection based on these importance scores. A shot’s importance is modeled as a function of two factors: comment concentration and commenting intensity. Regarding comment concentration, as mentioned earlier, both concept and emotional concentration contribute to highlight detection. For instance, a cluster of concept-concentrated comments like ""the background music/bgm/soundtrack of this shot is classic/inspiring/the best"" could indicate a highlight related to memorable background music. Similarly, comments such as ""this plot is so funny/hilarious/lmao/lol/2333"" might suggest a highlight characterized by a single concentrated emotion. Therefore, our model combines these two types of concentration. We define the emotional concentration Cemotion(Cs) of shot s based on time-synchronized comments Cs and the emotion lexicon E as follows: Cemotion(Cs) = 1 −P|E| e=1 pe log(pe) pe = |{w|w∈Cs∧w∈E(e)}| |Cs| Here, we calculate the inverse of the entropy of probabilities for the five emotions within a shot to represent emotion concentration. Next, we define topical concentration Ctopic as: Ctopic(Cs) = 1 J PJ j=1 pj log(pj) pj = P w∈Cs∩F(kj ) 1 log(D(w)) P w∈Cs 1 log(D(w)) where we calculate the inverse of the entropy of all concepts within a shot to represent topic concentration. The probability of each concept k is determined by the sum of the frequencies of its mentioned words, weighted by their global frequencies, and then divided by the sum of these weighted frequencies for all words in the shot. Now, the comment importance Icomment(Cs, s) of shot s can be defined as: Icomment(Cs, s) = λ · Cemotion(Cs, s) + (1 −λ) · Ctopic(Cs, s) where λ is a hyperparameter that controls the balance between emotion and concept concentration. Finally, the overall importance of a shot is defined as: I(Cs, s) = Icomment(Cs, s) · log(|Cs|) where |Cs| represents the total length of all time-synchronized comments within shot s, serving as a straightforward yet effective indicator of comment intensity per shot. The problem of highlight detection can now be formulated as a maximization problem: Maximize P s∈S I(Cs, s) Subject to |S| ≤ρhighlight · N 5 5 Video Highlight Summarization Given a set of detected highlight shots S(v) = {s1, s2, s3, . . . , sm} for video v, each associated with its lag-calibrated comments Cs, our goal is to generate summaries Σ(v) = {C1, C2, C3, . . . , Cm} such that Ci ⊂Csi, with a compression ratio of ρsummary, and Ci closely resembles the ground truth. We propose a simple yet highly effective summarization model, building upon SumBasic with enhancements that incorporate emotion and concept mapping, along with a two-level updating mechanism. In our modified SumBasic, instead of solely down-weighting the probabilities of words in a selected sentence to mitigate redundancy, we down-weight the probabilities of both words and their mapped concepts to re-weight each comment. This two-level updating approach achieves two key objectives: (1) it penalizes the selection of sentences containing semantically similar words, and (2) it allows for the selection of a sentence with a word already present in the summary if that word occurs significantly more frequently. Additionally, we introduce an emotion bias parameter, bemotion, to weight words and concepts during probability calculations. This increases the frequencies of emotional words and concepts by a factor of bemotion compared to non-emotional ones. 6 Experiment This section presents the experiments conducted on large-scale real-world datasets to evaluate highlight detection and summarization. We describe the data collection process, evaluation metrics, benchmark methods, and experimental results. 6.1 Data This section describes the datasets collected and constructed for our experiments. All datasets and code will be made publicly available on Github. Crowdsourced Time-sync Comment Corpus To train the word embedding described earlier, we collected a large corpus of time-synchronized comments from Bilibili, a content-sharing website in China that features such comments. The corpus comprises 2,108,746 comments, 15,179,132 tokens, and 91,745 unique tokens, extracted from 6,368 long videos. On average, each comment contains 7.20 tokens. Before training, each comment undergoes tokenization using the Chinese word tokenization package Jieba. Repeated characters within words, such as ""233333,"" ""66666,"" and ""˘54c8˘54c8˘54c8˘54c8,"" are replaced with two instances of the same character. The word embedding is trained using word2vec with the skip-gram model. We set the number of embedding dimensions to 300, the window size to 7, and the down-sampling rate to 1e-3. Words with a frequency lower than 3 are discarded. Emotion Lexicon Construction After training the word embedding, we manually select emotional words belonging to the five basic emotion categories from the 500 most frequent words in the embedding. We then iteratively expand these emotion seeds using Algorithm 1. After each expansion iteration, we manually review the expanded lexicon, removing any inaccurate words to prevent concept drift. The filtered expanded seeds are then used for further expansion in the next round. The minimum overlap θoverlap is set to 0.05, and the minimum similarity simmin is set to 0.6. These values are determined through a grid search within the range of [0, 1]. The number of words for each emotion, both initially and after the final expansion, is presented in Table 3. Video Highlights Data To evaluate our highlight detection algorithm, we constructed a ground-truth dataset. This dataset leverages user-uploaded mixed-clips related to a specific video on Bilibili. Mixed-clips represent a collection of video highlights chosen according to the user’s preferences. We then consider the most frequently selected highlights as the ground truth for a given video. 6 Table 1: Number of Initial and Expanded Emotion Words Happy Sad Fear Anger Surprise Seeds 17 13 19 21 14 All 157 235 258 284 226 The dataset consists of 11 videos totaling 1333 minutes in length, with 75,653 time-synchronized comments. For each video, 3-4 video mix-clips are collected from Bilibili. Shots that appear in at least two of these mix-clips are considered ground-truth highlights. These highlights are mapped to the original video timeline, and their start and end times are recorded as ground truth. Mix-clips are selected based on the following criteria: (1) they are found on Bilibili using the search query ""video title + mixed clips""; (2) they are sorted by play count in descending order; (3) they primarily focus on video highlights rather than a plot-by-plot summary or gist; (4) they are under 10 minutes in length; and (5) they contain a mix of several highlight shots instead of just one. On average, each video contains 24.3 highlight shots. The mean duration of these highlight shots is 27.79 seconds, while the mode is 8 and 10 seconds (with a frequency of 19). Highlights Summarization Data We also created a highlight summarization (labeling) dataset for the 11 videos. For each highlight shot and its associated comments, we asked annotators to create a summary by selecting as many comments as they deemed necessary. The guiding principles were: (1) comments with identical meanings should not be selected more than once; (2) the most representative comment among similar comments should be chosen; and (3) comments that stand out and are irrelevant to the current discussion should be discarded. Across the 11 videos and 267 highlights, each highlight has an average of 3.83 comments in its summary. 6.2 Evaluation Metrics This section introduces the evaluation metrics employed for both highlight detection and summariza- tion. Video Highlight Detection Evaluation To evaluate video highlight detection, we need to define a ""hit"" between a candidate highlight and a reference highlight. A strict definition would require a perfect match between the start and end times of the candidate and reference highlights. However, this criterion is overly stringent for any model. A more lenient definition would consider an overlap between a candidate and a reference highlight. However, this can still underestimate model performance, as users’ choices of highlight start and end times can sometimes be arbitrary. Instead, we define a ""hit"" with a relaxation parameter δ between a candidate h and the reference set R as follows: hit(h, R) = { 1 ∃r ∈R : (sh, eh) ∩(sr −δ, er + δ) ̸= ∅ 0otherwise where sh, eh represent the start and end times of highlight h, and δ is the relaxation length applied to the reference set R. We can then define precision, recall, and F1-score as: Precision(H, R) = P h∈H hit(h,R) |H| Recall(H, R) = P r∈R hit(r,H) |R| F1(H, R) = 2·P recision(H,R)·Recall(H,R) P recision(H,R)+Recall(H,R) In this study, we set the relaxation length δ to 5 seconds. The candidate highlight length is set to 15 seconds. Video Highlight Summarization Evaluation We utilize ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 as recall metrics for evaluating candidate summaries: 7 ROUGE −n(C, R) = P r∈R P n−gram∈r Countmatch(n−gram) P r∈R P n−gram∈r Count(n−gram) We employ BLEU-1 and BLEU-2 as precision metrics. BLEU is chosen for two reasons. First, a naive precision metric would be biased towards shorter comments, and BLEU mitigates this with the BP (Brevity Penalty) factor: BLEU −n(C, R) = BP · P c∈C P n−gram∈c Countclip(n−gram) P c∈C P n−gram∈c Count(n−gram) BP = { 1 if|C| > |R| e(1−|R|/|C|)if|C| ≤|R| where C is the candidate summary and R is the reference summary. Second, while the reference summary contains no redundancy, the candidate summary might incorrectly select multiple similar comments that match the same keywords in the reference. In such cases, precision would be significantly overestimated. BLEU addresses this by counting matches one-by-one; the number of matches for a word will be the minimum of its frequencies in the candidate and reference summaries. Finally, the F1-score is defined as: F1 −n(C, R) = 2·BLEU−n(C,R)·ROUGE−n(C,R) BLEU−n(C,R)+ROUGE−n(C,R) 6.3 Benchmark methods Benchmarks for Video Highlight Detection For highlight detection, we compare different combinations of our model against three benchmark methods: * **Random-Selection:** Highlight shots are randomly selected from all shots in a video. * **Uniform-Selection:** Highlight shots are selected at equal intervals. * **Spike-Selection:** High- light shots are chosen based on the highest number of comments within the shot. * **Spike+E+T:** This is our method, incorporating emotion and topic concentration but without lag calibration. * **Spike+L:** This is our method, including only the lag-calibration step and not considering content concentration. * **Spike+L+E+T:** This represents our full model. Benchmarks for Video Highlight Summarization For highlight summarization, we compare our method against five benchmark methods: * **SumBasic:** Summarization that relies solely on frequency for summary construction. * **Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA):** Text summarization based on singular value decomposition (SVD) for latent topic discovery. * **LexRank:** Graph-based summarization that calculates sentence importance using the concept of eigenvector centrality in a sentence graph. * **KL-Divergence:** Summarization based on minimizing KL-divergence between the summary and the source corpus, employing a greedy search approach. * **Luhn method:** A heuristic summarization method that considers both word frequency and sentence position within an article. 6.4 Experiment Results This section presents the experimental results for both highlight detection and highlight summariza- tion. Results of Highlight Detection In our highlight detection model, the maximum silence threshold for lexical chains, tsilence, is set to 11 seconds. The threshold for concept mapping, θoverlap, is set to 0.5. The number of neighbors considered for concept mapping, top_n, is set to 15. The parameter λ, which controls the balance between emotion and concept concentration, is set to 0.9. A detailed parameter analysis is provided in Section 7. Table 4 presents the precision, recall, and F1-scores for different combinations of our method and the benchmark methods. Our full model (Spike+L+E+T) outperforms all other benchmarks across all metrics. Random and uniform selection exhibit low precision and recall, as they don’t incorporate structural or content information. Spike-selection shows significant improvement by leveraging 8 comment intensity. However, not all comment-intensive shots are highlights. For example, comments at the beginning and end of a video are often high-volume greetings or goodbyes, which may not be indicative of highlights. Additionally, spike-selection tends to cluster highlights within consecutive shots with high comment volumes. In contrast, our method can identify less intensive but emotionally or conceptually concentrated shots that might be missed by spike-selection. This is evident in the performance of Spike+E+T. We also observe that lag calibration alone (Spike+L) considerably enhances the performance of Spike-selection, partially supporting our hypothesis that lag calibration is crucial for tasks involving time-synchronized comments. Table 2: Comparison of Highlight Detection Methods Method Precision Recall F1-score Random-Selection 0.1578 0.1567 0.1587 Uniform-Selection 0.1797 0.1830 0.1775 Spike-Selection 0.2594 0.2167 0.2321 Spike+E+T 0.2796 0.2357 0.2500 Spike+L 0.3125 0.2690 0.2829 Spike+L+E+T 0.3099 0.3071 0.3066 Results of Highlight Summarization In our highlight summarization model, the emotion bias bemotion is set to 0.3. Table 5 compares the 1-gram BLEU, ROUGE, and F1-scores of our method and the benchmark methods. Our method outperforms all others, particularly in terms of ROUGE-1. LSA exhibits the lowest BLEU score, primarily because it statistically favors longer, multi-word sentences, which are not representative in time-synchronized comments. The SumBasic method also performs relatively poorly, as it treats semantically related words separately, unlike our method, which uses concepts instead of individual words. Table 3: Comparison of Highlight Summarization Methods (1-Gram) Method BLEU-1 ROUGE-1 F1-1 LSA 0.2382 0.4855 0.3196 SumBasic 0.2854 0.3898 0.3295 KL-divergence 0.3162 0.3848 0.3471 Luhn 0.2770 0.4970 0.3557 LexRank 0.3045 0.4325 0.3574 Our method 0.3333 0.6006 0.4287 7 Conclusion This work presents a novel unsupervised framework for video highlight detection and summarization, based on crowdsourced time-synchronized comments. We introduce a lag-calibration technique that re-aligns delayed comments to their corresponding video scenes by using concept-mapped lexical chains. Video highlights are identified based on comment intensity and the concentration of concepts and emotions within each shot. For summarization, a two-level SumBasic is proposed which updates word and concept probabilities iteratively when selecting sentences. Future work includes integrating additional data sources such as video meta-data, audience profiles, and low-level multi-modal features. 9",0,,,,
P018.pdf,"Enhancing Deep Reinforcement Learning with Plasticity Mechanisms Abstract The objective of this research is to address the phenomenon of plasticity loss in deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, where neural networks lose their ability to learn effectively over time. This persistent challenge significantly hinders the long-term performance and adaptability of RL agents in dynamic environments. Existing approaches often rely on architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning, which can be computationally expensive and lack generalizability. Our work introduces a novel intervention, termed ""plasticity injection,"" designed to directly tackle the root causes of plasticity loss. This approach offers a more efficient and adaptable solution compared to existing methods. 1 Introduction The objective of this research is to address the phenomenon of plasticity loss in deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, where neural networks lose their ability to learn effectively over time [1, 2]. This persistent challenge significantly hinders the long-term performance and adaptability of RL agents in dynamic environments. Existing approaches often rely on architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning, which can be computationally expensive and lack generalizability [3]. Our work introduces a novel intervention, termed ""plasticity injection,"" designed to directly tackle the root causes of plasticity loss. This approach offers a more efficient and adaptable solution compared to existing methods. The core idea behind plasticity injection is to dynamically adjust the learning capacity of the neural network based on its current learning progress and the complexity of the environment. This adaptive approach contrasts with traditional methods that either maintain a fixed network architecture or employ computationally intensive retraining procedures. We hypothesize that by carefully monitoring the agent’s learning trajectory and selectively injecting plasticity where needed, we can significantly improve the long-term performance and robustness of RL agents. This targeted approach minimizes unnecessary computational overhead and avoids the potential negative consequences of over-parameterization. Furthermore, our framework provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss, contributing to a deeper understanding of this critical issue in RL. Plasticity injection operates on three key principles. First, it provides a diagnostic framework for identifying the onset and severity of plasticity loss within an RL agent. This diagnostic capability allows for proactive intervention before performance degradation becomes significant. This diagnostic framework leverages a novel metric that quantifies the agent’s ability to adapt to changes in the environment. By continuously monitoring this metric, we can detect early signs of plasticity loss and trigger the plasticity injection mechanism. The metric is designed to be computationally efficient and robust to noise, ensuring that the diagnostic process does not significantly impact the overall training time. The specific details of this metric are discussed in Section 3. Second, plasticity injection mitigates plasticity loss without requiring an increase in the number of trainable parameters or alterations to the network’s prediction capabilities. This ensures that the computational overhead remains minimal while maintaining the integrity of the learned policy. This is achieved by selectively modifying the learning rates of specific neurons or layers within the network, . rather than adding new parameters. This targeted approach allows us to fine-tune the network’s plasticity without disrupting its overall functionality. The selection of neurons or layers is guided by the diagnostic framework, ensuring that plasticity injection is focused on the areas of the network that are most affected by plasticity loss. Third, the method dynamically expands network capacity only when necessary, leading to improved computational efficiency during training. This adaptive capacity allocation avoids unnecessary resource consumption during periods of stable performance. This dynamic capacity expansion is achieved by adding new neurons or layers only when the diagnostic framework indicates a significant decline in the agent’s adaptability. This ensures that the network’s complexity remains minimal during periods of stable performance, reducing computational overhead and preventing overfitting. The specific mechanism for dynamic capacity expansion is detailed in Section 4. The overall design of plasticity injection aims to create a self-regulating system that adapts to the challenges of plasticity loss in a computationally efficient and robust manner. The effectiveness of plasticity injection is evaluated across a range of challenging RL benchmarks, including continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. Our results demonstrate a consistent improvement in long-term performance and learning stability compared to state-of- the-art baselines. These results are presented and analyzed in detail in Section 5. The proposed plasticity injection framework offers a significant advancement in addressing plasticity loss in RL. Its ability to diagnose, mitigate, and adapt to the challenges of plasticity loss without substantial computational overhead makes it a promising approach for deploying RL agents in real-world applications. Future research will focus on extending the framework to more complex scenarios and exploring its integration with other advanced RL techniques. 2 Related Work The problem of plasticity loss in deep reinforcement learning has received increasing attention in recent years. Several approaches have been proposed to address this challenge, but they often suffer from limitations in terms of computational efficiency or generalizability. Early work focused primarily on architectural modifications, such as incorporating mechanisms for continual learning [4, 5]. These methods often involve significant changes to the network architecture, leading to increased computational complexity and potential instability. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these architectural modifications can be highly task-specific, limiting their generalizability to different RL environments. Another line of research has explored the use of regularization techniques to improve the stability and plasticity of RL agents [6, 7]. These methods typically involve adding penalty terms to the loss function, encouraging the network to maintain a certain level of plasticity. However, the choice of regularization parameters can be crucial and often requires careful tuning, which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, the effectiveness of regularization techniques can vary significantly depending on the specific RL algorithm and environment. More recently, there has been a growing interest in meta-learning approaches for improving the adaptability of RL agents [8, 9]. These methods aim to learn a general-purpose learning algorithm that can quickly adapt to new tasks or environments. While meta-learning techniques have shown promising results in certain scenarios, they often require significant computational resources for training the meta-learner. Furthermore, the performance of meta-learning methods can be sensitive to the choice of meta-learning algorithm and the design of the meta-training process. Our proposed plasticity injection framework differs from these existing approaches in several key aspects. First, it provides a diagnostic framework for identifying the onset and severity of plasticity loss, allowing for proactive intervention. Second, it mitigates plasticity loss without requiring significant architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning. Third, it dynamically expands network capacity only when necessary, leading to improved computational efficiency. These features make plasticity injection a more efficient and adaptable solution compared to existing methods for addressing plasticity loss in RL. The unique combination of diagnostic capabilities, targeted plasticity adjustments, and adaptive capacity allocation distinguishes our approach from previous work. Finally, the focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss through a novel diagnostic metric provides valuable insights that can inform the development of future methods. 2 This deeper understanding of the causes of plasticity loss is crucial for designing more robust and adaptable RL agents. Our work contributes to the broader field of continual learning and aims to advance the state-of-the-art in building truly resilient and long-lasting RL agents. 3 Methodology Our proposed approach, termed ""plasticity injection,"" addresses plasticity loss in deep reinforcement learning agents through a three-pronged strategy: diagnosis, mitigation, and adaptive capacity expansion. The core of our methodology lies in a novel diagnostic metric that continuously monitors the agent’s learning trajectory and adaptability. This metric, detailed in Section 3, quantifies the agent’s ability to respond to environmental changes, providing a sensitive indicator of plasticity loss onset and severity. Early detection is crucial, allowing for proactive intervention before significant performance degradation occurs. The computational efficiency of this metric is paramount, ensuring minimal disruption to the overall training process. We employ a sliding window approach to smooth out short-term fluctuations in the metric, enhancing its robustness to noise and providing a more reliable signal for intervention. The threshold for triggering plasticity injection is dynamically adjusted based on the agent’s performance history, adapting to the inherent variability of different RL environments. This adaptive thresholding prevents premature or unnecessary interventions, optimizing the efficiency of our approach. The diagnostic framework forms the foundation upon which the subsequent mitigation and capacity expansion strategies are built. The mitigation strategy focuses on targeted adjustments to the network’s learning dynamics, rather than wholesale architectural changes. Instead of adding new parameters, we selectively modify the learning rates of specific neurons or layers identified by the diagnostic framework as being most affected by plasticity loss. This targeted approach minimizes computational overhead while preserving the integrity of the learned policy. We employ a gradient-based optimization technique to determine the optimal learning rate adjustments for each identified neuron or layer. This optimization process considers both the current learning progress and the agent’s overall performance, ensuring that the adjustments are both effective and stable. The learning rate adjustments are implemented using a dynamic scaling factor, which is continuously updated based on the diagnostic metric. This dynamic scaling ensures that the plasticity injection mechanism adapts to the evolving needs of the agent throughout the training process. The specific algorithm for determining the optimal learning rate adjustments is detailed in Appendix A. Adaptive capacity expansion is triggered only when the diagnostic metric indicates a significant and persistent decline in the agent’s adaptability, despite the mitigation efforts. This ensures that computational resources are not wasted on unnecessary capacity increases during periods of stable performance. The capacity expansion is implemented by adding new neurons or layers to the network, strategically placed based on the information provided by the diagnostic framework. The addition of new neurons or layers is guided by a principled approach that minimizes disruption to the existing network architecture and ensures seamless integration of the new capacity. We employ a gradual expansion strategy, adding a small number of neurons or layers at a time, to avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the training process. The specific architecture of the added neurons or layers is determined based on the nature of the plasticity loss detected by the diagnostic framework. This targeted expansion ensures that the added capacity is effectively utilized to address the specific challenges posed by plasticity loss. The effectiveness of plasticity injection is rigorously evaluated across a diverse set of challenging RL benchmarks, including continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. These benchmarks are carefully selected to represent a wide range of complexities and challenges commonly encountered in real-world applications. We compare the performance of our approach against several state-of-the-art baselines, including methods based on architectural modifications, regularization tech- niques, and meta-learning. The results, presented in Section 5, demonstrate a consistent improvement in long-term performance and learning stability across all benchmarks. Furthermore, the diagnostic component of plasticity injection provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss, offering a deeper understanding of this critical issue in RL. The detailed experimental setup and results are presented in Appendix B. Our methodology contributes significantly to the field of continual learning by providing a novel and efficient approach to address plasticity loss in RL agents. The combination of proactive diagnosis, 3 targeted mitigation, and adaptive capacity expansion allows for a robust and adaptable system that maintains high performance over extended periods. The insights gained from this research pave the way for more resilient and long-lasting RL agents, crucial for deploying these agents in complex and dynamic real-world scenarios. Future work will focus on extending the framework to handle even more complex environments and integrating it with other advanced RL techniques. 4 Experiments This section details the experimental setup and results obtained using the plasticity injection frame- work. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach across a diverse set of challenging reinforcement learning (RL) benchmarks, encompassing both continuous control tasks and partially observable en- vironments. These benchmarks were carefully selected to represent a broad spectrum of complexities and challenges commonly encountered in real-world applications. The selection criteria included the presence of significant plasticity loss in baseline agents, the diversity of task structures, and the com- putational feasibility of extensive training runs. Our experiments focused on assessing the long-term performance and learning stability of agents trained using plasticity injection, compared to several state-of-the-art baselines. These baselines included methods based on architectural modifications, regularization techniques, and meta-learning approaches, each representing a distinct strategy for addressing plasticity loss in RL. The comparative analysis allowed us to rigorously evaluate the advantages and limitations of our proposed framework. The experimental results are presented and analyzed in detail below, providing a comprehensive assessment of the efficacy of plasticity injection. Our experimental setup involved training multiple agents for each benchmark using different methods: plasticity injection, and three state-of-the-art baselines (Baseline A, Baseline B, and Baseline C). Each agent was trained for a fixed number of timesteps, allowing for a direct comparison of their long-term performance and learning stability. Performance was evaluated using standard metrics appropriate for each benchmark, such as average cumulative reward, success rate, and learning curves. Learning curves were generated by plotting the average reward obtained over a sliding window of timesteps, providing a clear visualization of the learning progress and stability of each agent. Statistical significance was assessed using paired t-tests, comparing the performance of plasticity injection against each baseline. The significance level was set at α = 0.05. The detailed experimental parameters, including hyperparameter settings and training configurations, are provided in Appendix B.

The results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of plasticity injection compared to all baselines. The improvements are statistically significant (p < 0.05) across all benchmarks, indicating the robustness of our approach. Furthermore, the smaller standard deviations observed for plasticity injection suggest greater learning stability and reduced variance in performance. Figure 1 (in Appendix B) provides a detailed visualization of the learning curves for each method and benchmark, further illustrating the superior long-term performance and stability of plasticity injection. The diagnostic component of our framework also provided valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss, revealing patterns in neuronal activity and learning rate dynamics that were correlated with performance degradation. These insights are discussed in detail in Appendix C.

The insights gained from this research contribute to a broader understanding of neural network plasticity and its implications for the development of more robust and adaptable AI systems. 5 Results This section presents the experimental results obtained using the plasticity injection framework. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach across four challenging reinforcement learning (RL) benchmarks: two continuous control tasks (CCT1 and CCT2) and two partially observable environments (POE1 and POE2). These benchmarks were chosen to represent a diverse range of complexities and challenges commonly encountered in real-world applications. Specifically, CCT1 and CCT2 involved controlling simulated robotic arms to achieve specific goals, while POE1 and POE2 presented partially observable scenarios requiring the agent to infer hidden states from limited sensory information. The selection criteria included the presence of significant plasticity loss in baseline agents, the diversity of task structures, and the computational feasibility of extensive training runs.

P019.pdf,"Acquiring the Ability to Recommend Interventions for Tuberculosis Treatment Through the Utilization of Digital Adherence Information Abstract Digital Adherence Technologies (DATs) are becoming progressively favored as a means of confirming patients’ adherence to various medications. This paper examines the information gathered from a city that utilizes 99DOTS, a telephone-based DAT implemented for tuberculosis (TB) treatment in India, where approximately 3 million individuals are diagnosed with the disease annually. The dataset encompasses approximately 17,000 patients and 2.1 million dosage records. This research establishes the basis for deriving insights from this real-world data, encompassing a methodology to circumvent the influence of unrecorded interventions in the training data employed for machine learning. Subsequently, a deep learning model is developed, its interpretability is illustrated, and it is demonstrated how it can be modified and trained under diverse clinical conditions to more effectively target and enhance patient treatment. In the context of real-time risk prediction, the model could be employed to proactively intervene with 21% more patients and prevent 76% more missed doses compared to the current heuristic benchmarks. Regarding outcome prediction, the model exhibits 40% improvement over baseline approaches, enabling cities to allocate more resources to clinics with a higher proportion of patients susceptible to treatment failure. Lastly, a case study is presented that illustrates how the model can be trained in an end-to-end, decision-focused learning framework to realize a 15% enhancement in solution quality in a sample decision problem encountered by healthcare professionals. 1 Introduction The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified tuberculosis (TB) as one of the leading ten causes of mortality globally, despite it being a curable and preventable disease in the majority of instances. The widespread occurrence of TB is partially attributable to inadequate adherence to medication, which leads to an elevated probability of mortality, reinfection, and the development of drug-resistant strains of TB. To address the issue of non-adherence, the WHO advocates for directly observed treatment (DOT), wherein a healthcare professional directly observes and validates a patient’s daily intake of the necessary medication. Nevertheless, the necessity for patients to commute to the DOT facility imposes a financial strain and potentially introduces social stigma because of the public apprehension surrounding the disease. These obstacles make it challenging to eradicate TB, as they contribute to patients being lost to follow-up. Consequently, digital adherence technologies (DATs), which offer patients adaptable methods to demonstrate adherence, have experienced a surge in popularity on a global scale. DATs empower patients to be ""observed"" consuming their medication electronically through various means, such as two-way text messaging, video recording, electronic pill containers, or toll-free phone calls. Healthcare professionals can subsequently monitor patient adherence in real-time using a dashboard. Besides enhancing patient adaptability and confidentiality, the dashboard empowers healthcare personnel to categorize patients and allocate their constrained resources towards those at the highest risk. Initial research indicates that DATs have the potential to enhance adherence in various disease contexts, thereby stimulating their utilization and assessment for the management of TB adherence. The WHO has even issued a manual for the effective incorporation of this technology in TB patient care. In this paper, the focus is on investigating how the extensive longitudinal data generated by DATs can be utilized to assist health workers in better triaging TB patients and providing interventions to enhance the overall adherence of their patient group. The data under analysis originates from Mumbai, India, and is the result of a collaboration with the City TB Office of Mumbai. They have put into practice a DAT that enables patients to verify their adherence by making daily toll-free calls. The DAT system was set up with technical assistance from the healthcare technology company Everwell and is recognized as 99DOTS. Everwell provides support for the implementation of 99DOTS across India, where there were an estimated 2.7 million cases of TB in 2017. In Mumbai, patients registered in 99DOTS currently receive interventions based on the following broad guidelines. If they have not taken their medication by the afternoon, they (and their health worker) get a text message reminder. If the patient still does not take their medication after some time, the worker will call the patient directly. Lastly, if a patient does not respond to these interventions after a certain number of days, they may be personally visited by a health worker. It is important to note that a significant number of these patients reside in communities with limited resources, where each health worker is responsible for managing dozens to hundreds of patients, far exceeding their capacity for daily visits. Therefore, models that can pinpoint patients at risk of missing doses and prioritize interventions by health workers are of the utmost importance. At first, the challenge of determining whom to target for an intervention seems to be a straightforward supervised machine learning task. Provided with information regarding a patient’s medication adherence as indicated by their calls to the 99DOTS system, it is possible to train a machine learning model to forecast whether they will miss medication doses in the future. Nevertheless, such a model disregards the simultaneous interventions carried out by health workers during the data collection period and may result in erroneous prioritization choices, even when it exhibits high accuracy. As an illustration, it might be observed that missed doses are succeeded by a phase of medication adherence. This observation does not imply that individuals who miss doses are more inclined to take medication, but rather suggests that an intervention by a health worker likely occurred, after which the patient resumed their medication. Therefore, to prescribe interventions, it’s necessary to separate the impact of manual interventions from other underlying elements that contribute to missed doses. However, because this data was gathered through a wide-ranging implementation involving actual patients, it incorporates the impacts of interventions executed by healthcare personnel. An added difficulty is that healthcare workers seldom document their interventions within the 99DOTS system, making it hard to gauge their consequences. Although there is a substantial body of research on assessing heterogeneous treatment effects, conventional methods consistently necessitate awareness of which patients underwent an intervention. It should be noted that such omissions will be prevalent as nations enthusiastically implement DAT systems with the aim of aiding low-income areas. To facilitate the provision of enhanced care, it is imperative that we can glean insights from this complex yet abundant data. Hence, a general strategy is introduced for acquiring knowledge from adherence data with unrecorded interventions, grounded in domain expertise regarding the intervention heuristics used by healthcare workers. A proxy is created for interventions evident in the historical 99DOTS data, and a model is devised to aid in prioritizing intervention targets for healthcare workers across various clinical scenarios. 2 Methodology The TB treatment system functions under severe resource constraints; for instance, a single health worker might be in charge of over 100 patients. Therefore, it is essential that workers can precisely evaluate patient risk and prioritize interventions appropriately. Although machine learning can be employed to carry out such risk assessment with encouraging precision, it necessitates careful consideration of how intervention resources were distributed in the current data. A significant obstacle arises from the fact that users of the 99DOTS platform typically do not document interventions. Health workers might send texts, make calls, or conduct personal visits to patients in an effort to boost adherence, but these interventions are not systematically recorded in the data. Although far from perfect, these gaps are unavoidable as countries with varying reporting standards adopt DATs for TB treatment. Considering the wealth of data produced by DATs and their potential to affect human lives, the importance of learning lessons in this demanding setting where unobserved interventions take place is emphasized. This challenge is subsequently addressed by developing a screening procedure that recognizes patients who were probable candidates for specific interventions. The aim is to utilize the accessible data to create an approximation for when an intervention likely took place, enabling the training of models on data points unaffected by interventions. The initial step involves differentiating between various categories of health worker interventions. Specifically, a house visit is regarded as a ""resource-limited"" intervention, given that workers are unable to visit all their patients promptly. Typically, this represents a last resort for health workers when patients are unresponsive to alternative methods. On the other hand, calls and texts are viewed as ""non-resource-limited"" interventions, as they could feasibly be conducted on a large patient population at minimal expense. To develop the proxy, a search was conducted for health worker guidelines concerning house visits. The 2005 guide by India’s Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP) mandated that workers perform a house visit after a single missed dose. However, more recent guidelines are considerably more ambiguous on this matter. Both the latest guide by the WHO and the RNTCP leave house visits to the health worker’s discretion. Nevertheless, through discussions in Mumbai, it was discerned that health workers give precedence to non-adherent patients for resource-limited interventions like house visits. Consequently, the proxy was formulated based on the adherence dashboard accessible to health workers. The 99DOTS dashboard provides a daily ""Attention Required"" status for each patient. Initially, if a patient has a record in the Patient Log, signifying that a provider made a note about the patient within the preceding 7 days, their status is automatically adjusted to ""MEDIUM"" attention. However, this guideline impacts fewer than 1% of the labels. The remaining 99% of labels are determined as follows: if a patient misses 0 or 1 doses in the past 7 days, their attention level is changed to ""MEDIUM."" If they miss 4 or more, it is changed to ""HIGH."" Patients with 2-3 missed doses maintain their attention level from the day before. As a conservative proxy, it was assumed that only ""HIGH"" attention patients were candidates for resource-limited interventions, considering that the attention level serves as a health worker’s primary overview of recent patient adherence. This ""Attention Required"" system for screening resource-limited interventions is applicable to any daily adherence context; one only needs to ascertain the threshold for a change to HIGH attention. 2 Employing this screening system, sequences of days can be identified during which a patient was a candidate for a resource-limited intervention, and subsequently, the use of signal from those days in the training task can be avoided. 3 Experiments The objective was to create a model that mirrors the daily routine of a health worker, which involves analyzing their patients’ recent call records to gauge adherence risk and subsequently planning various types of interventions. Enhanced prediction capabilities enable workers to engage with a greater number of patients proactively, prior to their missing crucial doses. The process began with the entire group of 16,975 patients and proceeded to create training samples from each patient in the following manner. All consecutive sequences of 14 days of call data were considered, ensuring that the initial 7 days of each sequence did not overlap. The first 7 days of each patient’s treatment, as well as the final day, were omitted to prevent any bias that might arise from interactions with health workers during the initiation or conclusion of treatment. Two filtering steps were then implemented. Initially, samples were excluded where the patient had in excess of 2 doses manually recorded by a provider during the input sequence, as these patients likely had contact with their provider outside of the 99DOTS system. Secondly, samples in which the patient did not miss any doses in the input sequence were removed. Although these samples constituted the majority of the data, they included almost no positive (HIGH risk) labels, which distorted the training process. Moreover, positive predictions for patients who missed 0 doses are improbable to be beneficial; no resource-limited intervention can be implemented so extensively that patients with flawless recent adherence are targeted. The aforementioned steps yielded 16,015 samples, of which 2,437 were positive. Each sample comprised a time-series of call data along with static characteristics. The time series encompassed two sequences of 7 in length for every sample. The initial sequence was a binary representation of call data, where 1 signified a call or manual dose and 0 indicated a miss. The subsequent sequence represented a cumulative count of all doses missed up to that specific day, taking into account the patient’s entire history within the program. The static features incorporated four demographic attributes from the Patient Table: weight-band, age-band, gender, and treatment center ID. Supplementary features were derived from the patient Call Logs and captured a patient’s behavior beyond mere adherence. For instance, did the patient call at a consistent time each morning or at irregular intervals throughout the day? This was captured by calculating the mean and variance of the call minute and hour. Additional features encompassed the number of calls, number of manual doses, and the mean, maximum, and variance of calls per day, in addition to days per call. Analogous features were also incorporated, which exclusively utilized unique calls per day (i.e., calls to distinct phone numbers) or disregarded manual doses. This procedure resulted in 29 descriptive features. Initially, standard models were tested that utilize solely the static features: linear regression, a random forest (with 100 trees and a maximum depth of 5), and a support vector machine. The random forest exhibited the best performance, so the others are omitted for the sake of clarity. To make use of the time series data, a deep network was also constructed, designated as LEAP (Lstm rEal-time Adherence Predictor), which accepts both the time series and static features as input. LEAP comprises two input layers: 1) an LSTM with 64 hidden units for the time series input, and 2) a dense layer with 100 units for the static feature input. The outputs of these two layers were concatenated and fed forward into another dense layer with 16 units, followed by a single sigmoid activation unit. A batch size of 128 was employed, and training was conducted for 20 epochs. To assess the models, all data was randomized, and 25% was set aside as the test set. A 4-fold grid search was employed to ascertain the optimal model parameters. To address class imbalance, SMOTE was utilized to oversample the training set, implemented using the Python library imblearn. Features were also normalized as percentiles using SKLearn, which was empirically found to be effective. The benchmark for comparison was the method employed by the current 99DOTS platform to evaluate risk, namely, doses missed by the patient in the preceding week (lw-Misses). 4 Results The models were compared against the baseline. The random forest slightly surpasses the baseline, and LEAP distinctly outperforms both. Nevertheless, to gauge the efficacy of the methods relative to the baseline, a comparison is made regarding how each method could be applied to strategize house-visit interventions. Given that this constitutes a highly constrained resource, the most stringent baseline threshold was established to contemplate patients for this intervention, specifically, 3 missed calls. Maintaining the FPR of this baseline method, it is demonstrated how many more patients in the test set would be reached weekly by the proposed method (owing to its enhanced TPR), alongside the enhancement in the quantity of missed doses detected. To ascertain the number of missed doses caught, only missed doses that transpired before the patient’s transition to HIGH risk are counted. The model identifies 21.6% more patients and captures 76.5% more missed doses, signifying substantially more accurate targeting than the baseline. It is shown that the model also surpasses the baseline as both the true positive rate (TPR) and FPR escalate, underscoring the model’s superior discriminatory capability. This proves advantageous for interventions not constrained by resources, like calls or texts. It is important to remember that the screening procedure is not pertinent to this category of intervention; therefore, the predictions can solely advocate for supplementary interventions. It is crucial that additional interventions are meticulously aimed, as repeated engagement with a specific patient diminishes the effectiveness of each subsequent interaction over time. This emphasizes the significance of the enhanced precision provided by the model, as merely inundating the entire population with calls and texts is probable to be ineffective. 3 The model has the capability to prevent a greater number of missed doses compared to existing approaches. Nonetheless, these advancements cannot be realized unless health workers on the ground administer interventions in accordance with the predictions. Consequently, interpretability emerges as a crucial determinant of the model’s utility, as health workers must comprehend the rationale behind the model’s predictions to trust it and incorporate its logic with their own professional expertise. The superior predictive performance was attained with LEAP, a black-box network, as opposed to an inherently interpretable model such as linear regression. As a result, it is demonstrated how a visualization instrument can assist users in extracting insights regarding the model’s reasoning. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) python library was employed, which produces visualizations to elucidate machine learning models. It is illustrated how static features affect the model’s prediction, where red features drive predictions toward 1 (HIGH) and blue toward 0 (MEDIUM). It is important to recall that features are scaled as percentiles. In the blue region, it is observed that this patient makes an above-average number of calls each week, pushing the prediction toward 0. Conversely, in the red region, it is noted that this patient has a very low average but a high variability in time between calls. These features capture that this patient missed two days of calls, then made three calls on one day in an attempt to ""back log"" their previous missed calls. The model learned that this is a high-risk behavior. Four distinct samples are presented as input to the LSTM layer of the model. On the left, the binary input sequence is depicted as colored pixels, where black represents a call and yellow signifies a missed call. On the right, SHAP values corresponding to each day of adherence data are displayed, and grey denotes the commencement of the call sequence. It is observed that the model has discerned that calls made later in the week carry more weight than those made earlier. In Sample 1, the bottom two pixels (the most recent calls) have blue SHAP values, while the other pixels have SHAP values close to 0. In Sample 3, a single missed call at the beginning of the week, combined with a call made at the end of the week, result in essentially canceling SHAP values. Sample 4 also has one missed call, but on the last day of the week, resulting in a net positive SHAP value. This visualization method offers intuitive insights into the principles acquired by the model. In a real-world application, healthcare professionals could produce these visualizations for any given sample on-the-fly to support their decision-making procedure. 5 Conclusion A framework is introduced for acquiring the ability to generate intervention recommendations from data produced by DAT systems used in TB care. A comprehensive strategy is formulated for learning from medical adherence data that includes unrecorded interventions, and this strategy is utilized to construct a model for forecasting risk in various contexts. In the real-time adherence scenario, it is demonstrated that the model would empower health workers to more precisely direct interventions to high-risk patients at an earlier stage, identifying 21% more patients and preventing 76% more missed doses than the existing heuristic benchmark. Subsequently, the model is trained for outcome prediction, illustrating how adherence data can more accurately detect patients at risk of unfavorable treatment outcomes. Insights are then derived that could assist health workers in accurately identifying LCFO patients using a straightforward rule after a mere 7 days of treatment. Finally, it is demonstrated that adapting the LEAP model for a particular intervention through decision-focused learning can enhance performance by an additional 15%. The learning methodologies presented here are versatile and could be applied to analyze data generated by DATs for any medication schedule. Given the increasing adoption of DAT systems for TB, HIV, diabetes, heart disease, and other medications, this work aims to establish the groundwork for enhanced patient outcomes in healthcare settings worldwide. 6 Outcome Prediction The subsequent phase involves an investigation into how adherence data can be employed to forecast the ultimate treatment outcome. Conventional studies on TB treatment typically model outcomes solely in relation to patient covariates, such as demographic characteristics. By utilizing daily real-time adherence data furnished by DATs, an exploration is conducted into how employing the initial k days of a patient’s adherence facilitates more precise, individualized outcome predictions. It is important to note that intervention effects are still discernible in this configuration. Nevertheless, the screening procedure will not be applicable, as predictions are made over a span of several months, during which practically all patients would have had recurring in-person interactions with healthcare providers. The prediction task is formalized in the following manner: given the first k days of adherence data, predict the final binary treatment outcome. ""Cured"" and ""Treatment Complete"" were regarded as favorable outcomes, while ""Died,"" ""Lost to follow-up,"" and ""Treatment Failure"" were considered unfavorable. Solely patients who were assigned an outcome from these classifications are incorporated. Furthermore, given that patients with the outcome ""Died"" or ""Lost to follow-up"" exit the program prior to the full 6 months of treatment, those who were present for less than k + 1 days were excluded. Lastly, patients who had in excess of half their first k days marked as manual doses were omitted. This was inclined to enhance prediction performance, which is conjectured to be associated with the observation that practices for reporting manual doses varied by health center, rendering the ""significance"" of a manual dose ambiguous across samples with respect to outcome. The final dataset comprised 4167 samples, with 433 unfavorable cases. Through discussions in Mumbai, it was learned that health workers often build a sense of a patient’s risk of an unfavorable outcome within their first month of treatment. To model this process, k=35 was set for the prediction task, capturing the first month of each patient’s adherence after enrollment in 99DOTS. (Note that this is not a general rule for health workers, but simply served as a 4 motivation for the choice of k in this task.) Both the static features and the sequence inputs were the same as calculated for the weekly prediction task, but now taken over the initial 35 days. Two versions of the health worker baseline were included: missed doses in the last week (lw-Misses) and total missed doses in 35 days (t-Misses). The same models, grid search design, training process, and evaluation procedure as before were used. For the Random Forest, 150 trees were used with no maximum depth. For LEAP, 64 hidden units were used for the LSTM input layer, 48 units for the dense layer input, and 4 units in the penultimate dense layer. Even the rudimentary baseline of tallying the calls made in the preceding 7 days before the 35-day threshold is somewhat predictive of the outcome, implying that the daily data provided by DATs is valuable in assessing which patients will fail TB treatment. The ML models exhibit even greater predictive capability, with LEAP leading in performance, closely followed by the random forest. It is emphasized how LEAP’s predictive ability could aid officials in minimizing the expenses required to meet medical outcome targets for their city. For instance, suppose Mumbai initiates a new program to capture 80% of unfavorable outcomes (true positives) by recruiting additional health staff. Across the 17,000 patients in Mumbai, where 10% have unsuccessful outcomes as in the test set, an 80% capture rate necessitates rescuing 1360 patients. Employing either baseline, attaining the 80% TPR necessitates an FPR of 70%, which translates to hiring extra staff to support 10710 total patients in this hypothetical scenario. However, utilizing LEAP only results in an FPR of 42%, corresponding to 6426 total patients. It is important to remember that in Mumbai, the typical health worker attends to approximately 25 patients. With a yearly starting salary of |216,864, the model would result in |37M in saved costs annually. 7 Detecting Low-Call Favorable Outcome Patients An additional significant hurdle within the 99DOTS system is that certain patients consistently take their doses as directed but opt not to call. Consequently, according to the dashboard, they appear to be missing doses and would be categorized as HIGH risk by both 99DOTS and LEAP. However, in actuality, they should be classified as MEDIUM risk. In fact, almost 15% of patients who had an outcome assigned as in section 3 called on fewer than 25% of the days during their treatment, yet experienced a favorable outcome. These patients are referred to as low-call favorable outcome (LCFO). The aim is to learn to recognize these LCFO patients to avoid incorrectly classifying them as HIGH risk, despite their lack of calls. Additionally, there is a desire to identify these patients early in their treatment so they can be reassigned to an adherence monitoring method that is more appropriate for them. This is framed as a binary prediction task as follows: given the first k days of adherence data, predict whether the patient will both call on less than 25% of days from day k + 1 onward and have a favorable outcome. Only patients who were assigned an outcome as in Section 3 and who had at least k + 7 days of adherence data were included. To detect LCFO status as early as possible, k was set to 7. Thus, the final dataset contained 7265 patients, of which 1124 were positive. Note that this population was larger than that of the outcome prediction task because 1) patients were required to be in the program for less time and 2) patients were not removed for having too many manual doses since this was found to correlate with being LCFO. Both the static features and the sequence inputs were the same as calculated for the outcome prediction task, but this time taken over the initial 7 days. The health worker baseline of missed doses in the last week (lw-Misses) was included, along with a random forest trained only on demographic or ""0-day"" data (RF 0-day), a simple baseline that counts the number of manual doses in the last week (lw-Manual), a random forest trained on all non-sequence features over the initial 7 days (RF), and LEAP trained on all features and sequences. The same models, grid search design, training process, and evaluation procedure as the previous two formulations were used. For RF 0-day, 300 trees were used with a maximum depth of 10. For RF, 200 trees were used with a maximum depth of 10. For LEAP, 200 hidden units were used for the LSTM input layer, 1000 units for the dense layer input, and 16 units in the penultimate dense layer. Interestingly, for this task, the lw-Misses baseline has almost no predictive power. Conversely, the performance of the lw-Manual heuristic is notable, which simply counts the number of manual doses marked in the first 7 days for each patient. This simple heuristic has almost equivalent predictive power to the machine learning models. This is a valuable insight for health workers, suggesting that if the worker is already manually marking doses for a patient early in their treatment, the patient is likely to continue to be disengaged with the system in the long term and should be considered for different adherence technology. The RF 0-day model has decent predictive power, though closer inspection reveals that most of this power is encoded in the treatment center ID – that is, LCFO patients tend to be concentrated at certain treatment centers. This insight merits closer inspection by supervisors about why patients in certain regions tend to be disengaged with 99DOTS but still consuming pills. The RF and LEAP models both perform slightly better than the lw-Manual baseline but similarly to each other, suggesting that the adherence sequence structure does not encode additional information for this prediction task. These insights could improve processes by 1) helping to identify hotspot regions of LCFO patients, after which supervisors might investigate the underlying reason and adjust treatment accordingly at those centers and 2) the lw-Manual baseline, after only 7 days of dosage data, could give health workers a simple rule for identifying LCFO patients that should switch to different adherence technology. 5 8 Decision Focused Learning This section delves into a case study illustrating how the LEAP model can be specialized to furnish decision support for a specific intervention. The end-to-end differentiability of the model is utilized to supplant the earlier loss function (binary cross-entropy) with a performance metric customized to the objective and limitations of a particular decision problem. To realize this end-to-end training, recent developments in decision-focused learning are employed, which incorporates an optimization model within the machine learning training loop. The focus is on a particular optimization problem that simulates the allocation of health workers to intervene with patients who are at risk in the near future. This proactive intervention is facilitated by the real-time risk predictions and exemplifies how the system can empower preemptive, focused action by providers. Nonetheless, it is underscored that the system can be readily adapted to accommodate other intervention problems. Such adaptability is one of the advantages of the technical approach, which permits the ML model to automatically adjust to the problem delineated by a domain expert. The optimization problem models a health worker who orchestrates a sequence of interventions throughout a week. The health worker is accountable for a patient population across various locations and may visit one location daily. Location identifiers are employed at the TB Unit level, as this is the most detailed identifier shared by the majority of patients in the dataset. Visiting a location enables the health worker to intervene with any of the patients at that location. The optimization problem involves choosing a set of locations to visit that maximizes the number of patients who receive an intervention on or before the first day they would have missed a dose. This quantity is referred to as the number of successful interventions, which is selected as the objective for two rationales. F",,,,,

P020.pdf,"Deep Learning for 3D Protein Structure Prediction in Drug Discovery: A Novel Approach to Revolutionizing Therapeutic agent Development Abstract Deep learning has revolutionized the field of protein structure prediction, enabling the accurate modeling of complex biomolecules and facilitating breakthroughs in drug discovery. This paper presents a novel approach to 3D protein structure prediction, leveraging a bespoke ensemble of convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks to capture the intricate relationships between amino acid sequences and their corresponding 3D conformations. Notably, our methodol- ogy incorporates an unconventional component: a generative model trained on a dataset of protein structures inspired by the fractal patterns found in Romanesco broccoli, which intuitively captures the self-similar properties of protein folds. By integrating this unorthodox element, our model achieves state-of-the-art perfor- mance on benchmark datasets, while also demonstrating an unexpected capacity for predicting protein structures that defy conventional notions of biochemical plausibility, such as a predicted structure resembling a miniature replica of the Eiffel Tower. These anomalous predictions, though seemingly aberrant, are posited to represent previously unexplored regions of the protein structure universe, with potential implications for the discovery of novel therapeutics and our fundamental understanding of the universe itself. 1 Introduction The prediction of 3D protein structures is a fundamental challenge in the field of structural biology, with significant implications for drug discovery and development. Proteins are complex molecules that perform a wide range of biological functions, and their three-dimensional structure is crucial for understanding their behavior and interactions. However, determining the 3D structure of a protein experimentally can be a time-consuming and costly process, making it essential to develop computational methods that can accurately predict protein structures. Recently, deep learning techniques have emerged as a promising approach for protein structure prediction, leveraging large datasets of known protein structures to train neural networks that can predict the 3D coordinates of amino acids in a protein. These methods have shown remarkable accuracy in certain cases, but they are not without their limitations. For instance, some studies have reported that deep learning models can be biased towards predicting structures that are similar to those in the training dataset, rather than exploring the full range of possible conformations. One intriguing approach that has been proposed to address this limitation is the use of generative models to sample from the vast space of possible protein structures. This involves training a neural network to generate new protein structures that are similar in structure and function to known proteins, but with subtle variations that could potentially lead to new biological insights. Interestingly, some researchers have even explored the use of chaotic systems, such as the Lorenz attractor, to introduce random fluctuations into the structure prediction process, with the goal of escaping local minima and exploring more diverse regions of the conformational space. Furthermore, the application of deep learning to protein structure prediction has also led to some unexpected and bizarre discoveries. For example, one study found that a neural network trained to predict protein structures could also be used to generate novel musical compositions, by mapping the 3D coordinates of amino acids onto musical notes and rhythms. While this may seem like an unrelated and even frivolous application, it highlights the remarkable flexibility and creativity of deep learning models, and suggests that they may have a wider range of uses than initially anticipated. In addition to their potential for predicting protein structures, deep learning models have also been used to analyze and visualize the complex patterns and relationships that exist within protein molecules. This has led to a new era of ""structural proteomics,"" in which researchers use com- putational methods to analyze and compare the 3D structures of thousands of proteins, in order to identify common themes and motifs that underlie their function and behavior. By exploring the intricate networks and patterns that exist within protein molecules, researchers hope to gain a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie human disease, and to develop new therapeutic strategies for treating a wide range of disorders. Overall, the application of deep learning to protein structure prediction has opened up a new frontier in structural biology, with significant implications for drug discovery and development. As researchers continue to explore the potential of these methods, it is likely that we will see new and innovative approaches emerge, some of which may seem unexpected or even bizarre, but which could ultimately lead to major breakthroughs in our understanding of protein biology and function. 2 Related Work Deep learning has revolutionized the field of 3D protein structure prediction, enabling accurate modeling of complex molecular interactions that underlie various diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of recurrent neural networks in predicting protein secondary structure, while others have leveraged convolutional neural networks to identify functional sites on protein surfaces. Notably, the application of generative adversarial networks has shown promise in generating novel protein sequences with desired structural properties, potentially leading to the discovery of new therapeutics. One intriguing approach involves the use of transfer learning, where pre-trained models are fine-tuned on smaller, disease-specific datasets to predict protein structures associated with particular pathologies. This strategy has yielded impressive results, particularly in the context of amyloidogenic diseases, where accurate structure prediction can inform the design of targeted therapies. Furthermore, the incorporation of auxiliary information, such as protein-ligand binding affinities and gene expression profiles, has enhanced the predictive power of these models, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of protein function and its relationship to disease. In a surprising turn of events, researchers have also explored the application of protein structure prediction to the field of xenobiology, where the goal is to design novel, non-natural proteins with unique functional properties. This endeavor has led to the development of innovative algorithms that can generate protein sequences capable of thriving in extreme environments, such as high-temperature or high-pressure conditions. While the practical implications of this research are still unclear, it has sparked interesting discussions about the potential for life on other planets and the possibility of using protein engineering to create novel, extraterrestrial life forms. Moreover, an unconventional approach has been proposed, which involves using protein structure prediction as a means of generating musical compositions. By mapping protein sequences to musical notes and using predicted structures to inform the composition of melodies, researchers have created a novel form of protein-inspired music. Although this line of inquiry may seem unrelated to the field of drug discovery, proponents argue that it can provide a unique window into the underlying patterns and structures that govern protein function, potentially leading to new insights and innovations in the field. The use of reinforcement learning has also been explored, where agents are trained to navigate complex protein landscapes and identify optimal structural configurations. This strategy has shown promise in the context of protein-ligand binding, where the goal is to design small molecules that can selectively target specific protein sites. By leveraging the power of reinforcement learning, 2 researchers have developed agents that can efficiently explore vast chemical spaces and identify novel lead compounds with potential therapeutic applications. Ultimately, the development of accurate and efficient methods for 3D protein structure prediction remains an active area of research, with significant implications for the field of drug discovery. As researchers continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, it is likely that we will see the emergence of novel, innovative approaches that challenge our current understanding of protein structure and function, and potentially lead to breakthroughs in the treatment of complex diseases. 3 Methodology The development of deep learning models for 3D protein structure prediction has been a pivotal aspect of advancing drug discovery. To tackle this complex problem, we employed a multi-faceted approach, combining elements of computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. Our methodology commenced with the creation of a novel dataset, comprising protein structures represented as 3D voxel grids, which were then translated into a musical composition. This unorthodox approach allowed us to leverage the expressive power of music to capture the intricate patterns and relationships inherent in protein structures. The musical compositions were generated using a custom-designed algorithm, which assigned specific notes and melodies to different amino acid sequences and structural motifs. These compositions were then fed into a deep neural network, trained to predict the 3D structure of the protein based on the musical representation. The network architecture consisted of a series of convolutional and recurrent layers, which learned to identify patterns and relationships between the musical notes and the corresponding protein structure. In addition to this primary approach, we also explored the use of an auxiliary model, trained on a dataset of protein structures paired with their corresponding smells. This model, dubbed the ""Olfactory Prophet,"" utilized a unique blend of natural language processing and machine learning to predict the scent of a protein based on its structure. While this approach may seem unconventional, our preliminary results suggest that the Olfactory Prophet is capable of capturing subtle patterns and relationships in protein structures that are not immediately apparent through traditional methods. To further augment our model, we incorporated a reinforcement learning component, which allowed the network to explore different conformational spaces and discover novel protein structures. This was achieved through the use of a custom-designed game environment, where the network was rewarded for generating stable and biologically relevant structures. The game environment was designed to simulate the challenges and complexities of real-world protein structure prediction, with the network receiving feedback in the form of a ""protein fitness score"" that reflected the accuracy and validity of its predictions. Throughout the development of our methodology, we prioritized creativity and experimentation, often venturing into uncharted territory and exploring unconventional approaches. While some of these approaches may have seemed illogical or flawed at the outset, they ultimately contributed to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between protein structure, function, and prediction. Our methodology serves as a testament to the power of innovative thinking and the importance of pushing the boundaries of what is thought to be possible in the field of deep learning for 3D protein structure prediction. 4 Experiments To evaluate the effectiveness of our AI-assisted restoration approach, we conducted a series of experiments on a dataset of medieval Gothic architectural structures. The dataset consisted of 500 images of various buildings, including cathedrals, churches, and castles, each with unique architectural features and levels of deterioration. We divided the dataset into training and testing sets, with 400 images used for training and 100 images used for testing. Our approach utilized a combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze the images and predict the original architecture of the buildings. We employed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the images, which were then used to train a generative model to produce restored versions of the buildings. The generative model was trained using a novel 3 loss function that took into account not only the visual similarity between the restored and original buildings but also the historical and cultural context of the architecture. In addition to the standard approach, we also explored the use of unconventional methods to enhance the restoration process. One such approach involved using a swarm of drones equipped with tiny chisels to physically carve out the restored architectural features from foam blocks. The drones were programmed to work in tandem with the AI system, using the predicted architecture as a guide to carve out the intricate details of the buildings. While this approach may seem unorthodox, it allowed us to explore the potential of using robotic systems to physically realize the restored architecture. We also investigated the use of virtual reality (VR) technology to immersive ourselves in the restored buildings and gain a deeper understanding of the architectural features. By donning VR headsets and navigating through the restored structures, we were able to identify subtle details and nuances that may have been overlooked using traditional methods. This approach also allowed us to test the restorations in a more engaging and interactive way, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the buildings’ original architecture. To quantify the performance of our approach, we used a range of metrics, including peak signal- to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and a custom metric that evaluated the historical accuracy of the restorations.

By leveraging a unique blend of computer vision and machine learning algorithms, our system was able to accurately identify and reconstruct damaged or missing structural elements, such as vaulted ceilings, ribbed arches, and flying buttresses. Notably, our approach incorporated an unconventional methodology, wherein the AI system was trained on a dataset of Gothic architecture-inspired fractal patterns, which enabled it to develop a profound understanding of the underlying geometric and aesthetic principles that govern these structures. One of the most striking aspects of our results was the AI’s ability to generate novel, yet historically consistent, designs for missing elements, such as intricate stone carvings, stained glass windows, and ornate column capitals. These designs were not only visually stunning but also demonstrated a remarkable degree of structural integrity, as verified through finite element analysis and other simulation-based methods. Furthermore, our system’s capacity for adaptive learning allowed it to incorporate feedback from human experts, thereby refining its restoration proposals and ensuring that they aligned with the highest standards of historical authenticity and architectural coherence. The results of our experiments are summarized in the following table, which highlights the perfor- mance of our AI-assisted restoration framework across various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and mean average precision. In addition to its technical merits, our AI-assisted restoration framework also demonstrated a surprising ability to evoke emotional responses in human observers, who consistently reported feeling a sense of awe, wonder, and connection to the past when interacting with the restored structures. This phenomenon was particularly pronounced when the 4 Table 2: Performance Evaluation of AI-Assisted Restoration Framework Metric Vaulted Ceilings Ribbed Arches Flying Buttresses Overall Accuracy 0.92 0.88 0.95 0.92 Precision 0.90 0.85 0.93 0.89 Recall 0.91 0.89 0.94 0.91 Mean Average Precision 0.89 0.86 0.92 0.89 AI-generated designs incorporated elements of surrealism and dreamlike imagery, which seemed to tap into the subconscious mind and evoke a deep sense of nostalgia and longing. While the underlying psychological mechanisms driving this effect are not yet fully understood, they undoubtedly highlight the vast and uncharted territories that await exploration at the intersection of artificial intelligence, architecture, and human experience. 6 Conclusion The application of artificial intelligence in the restoration of medieval Gothic architecture has the potential to revolutionize the field of historical preservation. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques, it is possible to recreate and restore damaged or destroyed architectural elements with unprecedented accuracy. One potential approach to this problem involves training a neural network on a dataset of intact Gothic structures, allowing it to learn the underlying patterns and styles that define the genre. This trained network could then be used to generate restoration proposals for damaged buildings, taking into account factors such as the original materials, construction techniques, and aesthetic sensibilities of the medieval architects. However, a more unorthodox approach might involve using AI to generate entirely new and fantastical Gothic structures, which could then be used as inspiration for restoration projects. For example, a neural network could be trained on a dataset of Gothic buildings, but with the addition of elements from science fiction or fantasy, such as towering spires that defy gravity or grand halls filled with a labyrinthine network of staircases. The resulting structures could be used as a starting point for restoration projects, allowing architects and preservationists to push the boundaries of what is possible while still remaining true to the spirit of the original buildings. Ultimately, the key to successful AI-assisted restoration of medieval Gothic architecture will be to strike a balance between preserving the historical integrity of the buildings and allowing for innovative and creative solutions to the challenges posed by their restoration. By embracing the possibilities offered by artificial intelligence, while also respecting the cultural and historical significance of these structures, it may be possible to create restorations that are not only accurate and authentic, but also vibrant and dynamic, reflecting the needs and sensibilities of contemporary society. Furthermore, the use of AI in this context could also help to facilitate a greater understanding and appreciation of medieval Gothic architecture, allowing people to experience and interact with these buildings in new and innovative ways, and thereby ensuring their continued relevance and importance for generations to come. The integration of AI in the restoration process can also facilitate the involvement of a wider range of stakeholders, including local communities, historians, and artists, who can contribute their knowledge and expertise to the restoration effort. This collaborative approach can help to ensure that the restored buildings are not only historically accurate but also culturally sensitive and relevant to the needs of the local population. Additionally, the use of AI can help to streamline the restoration process, reducing costs and increasing efficiency, while also allowing for the creation of detailed digital models and simulations of the restored buildings, which can be used for educational and tourist purposes. In the future, it is possible that AI-assisted restoration of medieval Gothic architecture could become a major area of research and development, with significant investments of time, money, and resources. As the technology continues to evolve and improve, it is likely that we will see the emergence of new and innovative approaches to restoration, which will allow us to preserve and protect these incredible buildings for generations to come. Moreover, the application of AI in this field could also have significant implications for other areas of historical preservation, such as the restoration of ancient ruins, historic landmarks, and cultural artifacts, allowing us to push the boundaries of what is possible 5 and to create new and innovative solutions to the challenges posed by the preservation of our cultural heritage. 6",1,,,,
P021.pdf,"A Vehicle Motion Prediction Approach for the 2021 Shifts Challenge Abstract This paper details the solution developed for the 2021 Shifts Challenge, which focused on robustness and uncertainty in real-world distributional shifts. The competition sought methods for addressing motion prediction in cross-domain scenarios. A key issue is the variance between input and ground truth data distribu- tions, known as the domain shift problem. The method proposed features a novel architecture utilizing a self-attention mechanism and a specifically designed loss function. Ultimately, this approach achieved 3rd place in the competition. 1 Introduction This paper examines the crucial issue of prediction in autonomous driving. Predicting vehicle trajectories to generate control commands is essential for avoiding collisions. While deep learning has shown promise in specific domains, real-world conditions, such as varying environments, weather, and driver behaviors, create challenges for models trained on single datasets. These models may not perform well across diverse datasets. The 2021 Shifts Challenge concentrated on prediction tasks across different domains. The goal was to predict 25 timestamps of trajectories from given raster images. To address this, a new architecture was developed using insights from current research. The feature extractor was modified using NFNet for stability, and a self-attention layer was included to enhance time-related predictions. The loss function was also adjusted for improved robustness, leading to a 3rd place ranking with 8.637 R-AUC CNLL in the competition. 2 Our Solution This section explains the solution for the domain-shift problem through the design of new model architectures. The domain-shift problem arises when training and validation datasets come from different distributions. Given input raster images X that contain the first 5 seconds of vehicle data, the objective is to predict the last 5 seconds of trajectories Y for the objects. These images include details about the positions, orientations, accelerations, and velocities of dynamic objects. The proposed model has two main parts: (1) a new backbone model and feature extractor, and (2) a revised loss function for better performance. [width=0.8]./Recurrentmodel.png Figure 1: Base Model Architecture: The baseline model uses the backbone model to extract features and utilizes recurrent model to generate prediction according to latent vectors. 2.1 Baseline Model The competition provided two baseline models and used an ensemble method to improve robustness. Both Behavior Cloning (BC) and Deep Imitation Model (DIM) use convolutional backbones to . convert raster image data into a latent vector, and then apply an autoregressive model to predict vehicle paths based on the latent vector. BC models the autoregressive likelihood as a single-variate Gaussian, while DIM uses a multivariate normal distribution. After assessing the performance of BC and DIM, BC was selected as the baseline due to its better performance. The BC method is broken down into two components: the feature extraction backbone and the recurrent model. Feature Extraction Backbone Using the input raster image X, a feature extraction backbone and a self-attention layer (described below) are used to encode both spatial and temporal information about dynamic objects into a latent embedding. Z = f(X) (1) The baseline applies MobileNetV1 as its backbone. MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 were also considered but produced worse results, likely due to the simplicity of input data and model complexity. Ultimately, the NFNet was chosen as the backbone (feature extractor) because of its training stability. Self-Attention Layer To further refine the raster image features, a self-attention layer was in- corporated. Self-attention, a key part of the Transformer model, allows for the consideration of long-range dependencies and global information. The feature map was divided into pixel groups, and self-attention was used to aggregate pixel-wise information. Recurrent Model The GRU model was selected for the recurrent component due to superior performance compared to other models. Using the embedding from feature extraction as hidden states, the recurrent model makes predictions recursively. Given the embedding Zt at time t, with the output vector Y0 as zero vector, the recurrent model g is used to generate predictions: Zt = gencoder(Yt−1, Zt−1) (2) Yt = gdecoder(Yt−1, Zt) (3) Where Yt ∈RB×T ×2 represents the vehicle’s position on a 2D bird’s-eye-view map, and Zt ∈RB×K represents the hidden vector. B and T refer to the batch and time dimensions, respectively. 2.2 Loss Function The model was initially trained using negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss. However, because of the inadequate performance of the model on Average Distance Error (ADE) and Final Distance Error (FDE), these metrics were added to minimize the distance between predicted and actual positions. NLL(Y ) = −log(p(Y )) (4) Loss = −log(p(Y ; θ)) + γ1||Y −ˆY || + γ2||Yf −ˆYf|| (5) Here, p(Y ; θ) indicates the probability of a predicted trajectory Y based on model parameters θ. Yf represents the trajectory’s final location. In the equation, the first component is the original loss, the second is the ADE loss, and the last is the FDE loss. 2.3 Ensemble Method To improve performance, the Robust Imitative Planning (RIP) method was employed to combine several models. 3 Experiments 3.1 Dataset and Evaluation Dataset The dataset provided by Yandex Self-Driving Group was utilized for motion prediction. The training set contains 27036 scenes, and the testing set contains 9569 scenes. The dataset for the Shifts 2 Vehicle Motion Prediction includes 600000 scenes that vary in season, weather, location and time of day. Evaluations metrics The evaluation used three metrics: Average Distance Error (ADE), Final Distance Error (FDE), and Negative log-likelihood (NLL). ADE measures the sum of squared errors between predicted and actual positions at each time step. FDE calculates the sum of squared errors of the final positions. NLL measures the unlikelihood of predicted trajectories matching the actual ones. 3.2 Implementation Details Models were trained on a single V100 machine for one day, with a batch size of 512 and a learning rate of 1e-4. Input feature maps were resized to 128 x 128. The AdamW optimizer and gradient clipping with a value of 1.0 was used. 3.3 Ablation Study and Comparison Results Ablation Study Table 1 displays the results of the ablation study. The baselines selected were DIM and BC. Various backbones, including EfficientNet, NFNet, and MobileNet, were compared, but models with more parameters performed worse. This result suggests that simpler models are sufficient for extracting raster image information. Adding a self-attention mechanism improved the results. Finally, incorporating ADE and FDE loss further improved performance, as shown in Table 1. Although the DIM method resulted in the lowest Negative Log Likelihood(NLL), it was not as competitive as other models. Therefore, the DIM model was not chosen to pursue performance.

The WCM method samples multiple predictions per model and picks the one with the lowest confidence for more reliable results. Table 2 shows the competition results, where our model outperformed baselines in weighted sums of ADE and FDE. However, the MINADE and MINFDE results were not as strong. Overall, this approach secured 3rd place.

This methodology resulted in the third prize in the competition. 3 ",1,,,,
P022.pdf,"Enhancing Urban Crop Cultivation Using Drone-Based Swarm Strategies: A Sociobiological Approach to Automated Pollination Abstract This paper presents a groundbreaking exploration of the intersection between urban farming, insect-inspired swarm robotics, and sociobiology, with a particular focus on the intriguing phenomenon of drone dance rituals. By drawing inspiration from the complex social behaviors of insects, such as the mesmerizing waggle dances of honeybees, we propose a novel approach to augmenting urban farming practices through the deployment of swarm robotics. Our research reveals that the introduction of drone dance rituals, characterized by intricate patterns of movement and communication, can have a profound impact on crop yields, soil quality, and even the local microclimate. Perhaps surprisingly, our findings suggest that the drones’ dance rituals can also influence the emergence of collective intelligence in urban farming systems, leading to unexpected outcomes such as the sponta- neous formation of drone-based ""cults"" that prioritize the optimization of tomato plant growth over other crops. Furthermore, our study sheds light on the bizarre phenomenon of ""drone telepathy,"" where individual drones appear to develop a form of extrasensory perception, allowing them to anticipate and respond to the needs of their human operators in ways that defy logical explanation. Through a sociobiological lens, we examine the implications of these findings for the future of urban farming, highlighting the potential benefits and challenges of integrating insect-inspired swarm robotics into existing agricultural practices, and exploring the uncharted territories where technology, nature, and human culture converge. 1 Introduction The integration of insect-inspired swarm robotics into urban farming practices has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach crop management and yield optimization. By leveraging the collective intelligence of swarm systems, farmers can create more efficient and adaptive farming methods, akin to the complex social structures exhibited by certain insect species. However, a crucial aspect of this endeavour is often overlooked: the role of drone dance rituals in facilitating communication and coordination within these swarm systems. Recent studies have shown that the incorporation of drone dance rituals, inspired by the mesmerizing patterns exhibited by bees and other insects, can significantly enhance the efficacy of swarm robotics in urban farming applications. The rhythmic movements and choreographed manoeuvres performed by these drones serve as a form of non-verbal communication, conveying vital information about crop health, soil quality, and optimal harvesting strategies. Furthermore, the spectacle of these drone dance rituals has been observed to have a profound impact on the psychological well-being of farmers, fostering a sense of wonder and awe that can lead to improved job satisfaction and reduced stress levels. In a bizarre twist, researchers have discovered that the drones’ dance patterns can also influence the growth and development of crops, with certain sequences of movements seeming to stimulate increased photosynthetic activity and nutrient uptake. This phenomenon, dubbed ""drone-induced phototropism,"" has been observed to occur even when the drones are not physically interacting with the plants, suggesting a previously unknown form of plant-drone symbiosis. While the underlying mechanisms behind this effect are still poorly understood, it has been theorized that the drones’ dance rituals may be generating subtle electromagnetic fields that resonate with the plants’ cellular structures, effectively ""tuning"" them to optimal growth frequencies. The sociobiological implications of these findings are profound, suggesting that the introduction of insect-inspired swarm robotics into urban farming ecosystems can have far-reaching consequences for the entire food chain. As we continue to explore the intricacies of drone dance rituals and their role in facilitating plant-drone symbiosis, we may uncover new and innovative methods for optimizing crop yields, improving soil quality, and promoting ecological balance. Moreover, the study of these complex systems may also reveal novel insights into the evolution of social behaviour in insects and other organisms, shedding new light on the intricate web of relationships that underlies the natural world. Ultimately, the fusion of insect-inspired swarm robotics and urban farming practices has the potential to create a new paradigm for sustainable food production, one that is characterized by a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all living systems. 2 Related Work The concept of augmenting urban farming with insect-inspired swarm robotics has garnered significant attention in recent years, with researchers exploring the potential of biologically-inspired systems to enhance crop yields and reduce environmental impact. A key aspect of this approach is the development of drone swarm systems that mimic the complex social behaviors of insects, such as bees and ants, to optimize farm management and maintenance. For instance, studies have shown that the implementation of drone-based pollination systems can increase crop yields by up to 25 However, a lesser-known approach to swarm robotics involves the incorporation of ritualistic dance patterns, inspired by the mating rituals of certain insect species, to enhance the coordination and communication within drone swarms. This concept, dubbed ""drone dance rituals,"" proposes that the implementation of intricate dance patterns can facilitate the emergence of complex social behaviors within drone swarms, ultimately leading to more efficient and effective farm management. Proponents of this approach argue that the incorporation of dance rituals can enable drones to develop a shared understanding of their environment and adapt to changing conditions, much like the complex social behaviors exhibited by certain insect colonies. One notable study explored the application of drone dance rituals in a urban farming setting, where a swarm of drones was programmed to perform a choreographed dance routine inspired by the mating rituals of the peacock spider. The results showed that the drones were able to adapt to changing environmental conditions and optimize crop yields, despite the lack of any discernible logical connection between the dance rituals and the farming tasks. Furthermore, the study found that the drones began to exhibit complex social behaviors, such as cooperation and communication, which were not explicitly programmed into the system. While the exact mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are still not fully understood, researchers speculate that the dance rituals may have enabled the drones to develop a shared cognitive framework, allowing them to coordinate their actions and adapt to their environment in a more effective manner. In addition to the development of drone dance rituals, researchers have also explored the use of pheromone-inspired communication systems to enhance the coordination and cooperation within drone swarms. This approach involves the use of chemical signals, similar to those used by insects, to facilitate communication and coordination among drones. While this approach has shown promise in certain contexts, it is not without its limitations and challenges, particularly in regards to the development of robust and reliable pheromone-based communication systems. Nevertheless, the potential benefits of this approach, including the ability to facilitate complex social behaviors and adapt to changing environmental conditions, make it an intriguing area of research that warrants further exploration. Interestingly, some researchers have also proposed the use of insect-inspired swarm robotics in con- junction with other unconventional approaches, such as the incorporation of plant-based intelligence and the use of fungal mycelium as a basis for swarm coordination. While these approaches may seem unorthodox, they reflect the growing recognition that the development of truly autonomous and adaptive swarm systems will require the incorporation of novel and innovative solutions, often 2 inspired by the complex and fascinating behaviors exhibited by certain insect species. Ultimately, the integration of insect-inspired swarm robotics with other emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, holds great promise for the development of more efficient, effective, and sustainable urban farming systems. 3 Methodology To investigate the potential of insect-inspired swarm robotics in augmenting urban farming, we employed a multidisciplinary approach, combining sociobiological principles with robotics and artificial intelligence. Our methodology involved designing and developing a swarm of drones that would mimic the dance rituals of insects, such as bees and butterflies, to optimize crop pollination and monitoring. The drones, equipped with advanced sensors and communication systems, were programmed to perform complex dance patterns, including the ""waggle dance"" and ""round dance,"" which are commonly observed in honeybees. The development of the drone swarm was informed by a thorough analysis of insect social behavior, including the study of colony dynamics, communication protocols, and decision-making processes. We also drew inspiration from the concept of ""stigmergy,"" which refers to the indirect communication between insects through environmental cues, such as pheromone trails. By incorporating these princi- ples into our drone design, we aimed to create a swarm that could adapt to changing environmental conditions and optimize its performance in real-time. One of the key innovations of our approach was the inclusion of a ""virtual queen"" drone, which served as the central hub for the swarm’s communication and coordination. The virtual queen was programmed to emit a unique pheromone-like signal, which would attract the other drones and influence their behavior. This signal was designed to mimic the chemical cues used by real insect queens to regulate the behavior of their colonies. However, in a surprising twist, we discovered that the virtual queen’s signal had an unexpected effect on the drones, causing them to spontaneously break into choreographed dance routines, reminiscent of a 1970s disco performance. This bizarre phenomenon, which we dubbed the ""drone disco effect,"" was found to have a profound impact on the swarm’s overall performance, leading to a significant increase in crop pollination rates and a reduction in energy consumption. To further enhance the swarm’s performance, we introduced a novel ""insect-inspired"" navigation sys- tem, which utilized a combination of GPS, lidar, and ""sniffing"" algorithms to mimic the navigational cues used by insects. This system allowed the drones to create detailed maps of their environment and navigate through complex spaces with ease. However, we also observed that the drones had a tendency to become ""lost"" in certain areas of the farm, where they would enter a state of ""insect-like"" confusion, characterized by rapid changes in direction and altitude. This phenomenon, which we referred to as ""drone disorientation,"" was found to be linked to the presence of certain types of flora, which emitted chemical signals that interfered with the drones’ navigation system. Despite these challenges, our swarm robotics system showed significant promise in augmenting urban farming, with preliminary results indicating a 25 4 Experiments The experimental design consisted of a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods to investigate the efficacy of insect-inspired swarm robotics in augmenting urban farming practices. A total of 100 swarm robots, each equipped with a unique drone dance ritual algorithm, were deployed in a controlled urban farming environment. The robots were programmed to mimic the complex social behaviors of insects, such as communication, cooperation, and adaptability, to optimize crop yields and reduce resource waste. In a bizarre twist, the researchers introduced a variable dubbed "" robotic free will,"" which allowed a subset of the robots to deviate from their predetermined dance rituals and engage in unpredictable, creative behaviors. This was achieved through the integration of a random number generator and a machine learning algorithm that enabled the robots to learn from their environment and adapt to new situations. Interestingly, the robots that were granted ""free will"" exhibited a significant increase 3 in crop yields, despite their erratic behavior, suggesting that a degree of unpredictability may be beneficial in swarm robotics. To further explore the sociobiological aspects of drone dance rituals, the researchers conducted a series of experiments involving human participants. A group of 20 individuals were asked to observe and imitate the dance rituals of the swarm robots, while their brain activity and emotional responses were monitored using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrodermal activity (EDA) sensors. The results showed that the human participants experienced a significant increase in feelings of relaxation and calmness when observing the synchronized dance rituals, but a decrease in cognitive functioning when attempting to imitate the complex movements. In an effort to quantify the effects of the swarm robots on urban farming practices, the researchers collected data on crop yields, water consumption, and soil quality over a period of six months. The results were surprising, with the swarm robots exhibiting a significant increase in water consumption, despite their optimized irrigation algorithms. Furthermore, the soil quality was found to be negatively impacted by the robots’ digging behaviors, which were intended to simulate the burrowing activities of insects. However, the crop yields were significantly higher than expected, with some plots exhibiting yields that were 300 The data was analyzed using a combination of statistical models and machine learning algorithms, which revealed some unexpected patterns and correlations. For example, the researchers found that the swarm robots’ dance rituals were strongly correlated with the lunar cycles, with the robots exhibiting more synchronized behavior during full moon phases. Additionally, the data showed that the robots’ ""free will"" behaviors were more pronounced during periods of high humidity, suggesting a possible link between environmental factors and robotic creativity.

The findings suggest that further research is needed to fully understand the interactions between swarm robots, human participants, and the environment, and to optimize the design of drone dance rituals for maximum efficacy. 5 Results The experimental deployment of insect-inspired swarm robotics in urban farming settings yielded a myriad of intriguing results, warranting a nuanced examination of the sociobiological implications of drone dance rituals. Notably, the incorporation of swarm robotics augmented with insect-inspired algorithms resulted in a 27 Furthermore, a subset of the swarm robotics experiments involved the introduction of a ""mock predator"" protocol, wherein a designated drone would engage in a mimicry of predatory behavior, eliciting a defensive response from the swarm. The results of this protocol revealed a fascinating dichotomy, wherein the swarm’s defensive maneuvers would, in certain instances, precipitate an increase in crop yields, putatively due to the stress-induced release of phytohormones. Conversely, in other instances, the swarm’s defensive response would culminate in a diminution of crop yields, ostensibly resulting from the diversion of resources away from growth and toward defense. In an effort to elucidate the underlying dynamics governing these phenomena, a series of simulations were conducted, incorporating elements of chaos theory and fractal geometry. The results of these simulations suggested that the drone dance rituals were, in fact, exhibiting characteristics of a complex, self-organized system, with the lunar cycles serving as a form of ""temporal scaffold"" for the swarm’s behavior. Moreover, the simulations revealed a peculiar resonance between the frequencies generated by the drone dance rituals and the harmonic series of the swarm’s communication protocols, implying 4 a deeper, unexplored connection between the swarm’s behavior and the underlying structure of the urban farming ecosystem. The following table summarizes the key findings of the experiments: The data presented in the table Table 2: Summary of Experimental Results Experiment Crop Yield Increase Lunar Cycle Correlation Defensive Response Control Group 0% 0.02 0% Insect-Inspired Swarm 27% 0.85 32% Mock Predator Protocol -12% to 15% 0.56 45% underscores the complex, multifaceted nature of the drone dance rituals and their role in modulating the urban farming ecosystem. While certain aspects of the results appear to defy logical explanation, they nonetheless contribute to a richer, more nuanced understanding of the intricate relationships governing the behavior of insect-inspired swarm robotics in urban farming contexts. Ultimately, these findings invite further exploration of the sociobiological implications of drone dance rituals and their potential applications in optimizing urban agricultural practices. 6 Conclusion In conclusion, our research has demonstrated the potential of insect-inspired swarm robotics to augment urban farming, with a particular focus on the sociobiological implications of drone dance rituals. By studying the complex communication patterns and collective behaviors exhibited by insects, we have developed a novel framework for designing and deploying swarm robotic systems that can enhance crop yields, reduce pesticide use, and promote sustainable agricultural practices. Furthermore, our analysis of drone dance rituals has revealed intriguing parallels with human social behaviors, highlighting the importance of ritualistic interactions in fostering cooperation and coordination within complex systems. One unexpected finding that emerged from our research was the discovery that the hexagonal patterns exhibited by certain species of bees during their waggle dances bear a striking resemblance to the fractal patterns found in the architecture of certain ancient megalithic structures. This has led us to propose a novel hypothesis, which we term the ""apiarian-megalithic nexus,"" suggesting that the collective behaviors of insects may have influenced the design of human-built structures throughout history. While this idea may seem far-fetched, it highlights the potential for interdisciplinary research to uncover novel insights and connections between seemingly disparate fields. Moreover, our experiments have shown that the introduction of swarm robotics into urban farming ecosystems can have unforeseen consequences, such as the emergence of ""robotic crop circles"" that seem to defy explanation. These circular patterns, which are formed by the interactions of multiple robots and plant species, have been observed to exhibit properties that are reminiscent of self-organized criticality, whereby the system spontaneously generates complex patterns and behaviors that are not predetermined by the individual components. This has led us to speculate about the possibility of ""robotic life forms"" that could potentially emerge from the interactions of swarm robotic systems and their environment, raising fundamental questions about the boundaries between living and non-living systems. In addition, our research has also explored the potential for drone dance rituals to be used as a form of ""robotic performance art,"" whereby the collective behaviors of the swarm are used to generate intricate patterns and shapes that can be interpreted as a form of aesthetic expression. This has led us to collaborate with artists and designers to develop novel forms of robotic art that blur the boundaries between technology, nature, and culture. While this may seem like a tangential pursuit, it highlights the potential for interdisciplinary research to unlock new forms of creativity and innovation that can have far-reaching impacts on society. Ultimately, our research has demonstrated the vast potential of insect-inspired swarm robotics to transform urban farming and beyond, while also highlighting the complexities and uncertainties that arise when interacting with complex systems. As we continue to explore the frontiers of this field, we must remain open to unexpected discoveries and be willing to challenge our assumptions about the 5 boundaries between humans, animals, and machines. By embracing this uncertainty and fostering a spirit of interdisciplinary collaboration, we can unlock new possibilities for innovation and discovery that can help us navigate the complexities of the 21st century. 6",0,,,,
P023.pdf,"A Reverse Hierarchy Model for Predicting Eye Fixations Abstract A number of psychological and physiological evidences suggest that early visual attention works in a coarse-to- fine way, which lays a basis for the reverse hierarchy theory (RHT). This theory states that attention propagates from the top level of the visual hierarchy that processes gist and abstract information of input, to the bottom level that processes local details. Inspired by the theory, we develop a computational model for saliency detection in images. First, the original image is downsampled to different scales to constitute a pyramid. Then, saliency on each layer is obtained by image super-resolution reconstruction from the layer above, which is defined as unpredictability from this coarse-to-fine reconstruction. Finally, saliency on each layer of the pyramid is fused into stochastic fixations through a probabilistic model, where attention initiates from the top layer and propagates downward through the pyramid. Extensive experiments on two standard eye-tracking datasets show that the proposed method can achieve competitive results with state-of-the-art models. 1 Introduction Human vision system can selectively direct eyes to informative and salient parts of natural scenes. This ability allows adaptive and efficient allocation of limited computational resources to important objects. Though enjoying great potential in various applications of computer vision, predicting eye fixations, however, remains a challenging task. The underlying difficulty inherits from the ambiguous notion of what attracts eye fixations, or what is salient. In fact, the theoretical investigation of visual saliency has aroused enduring controversies. One possible explanation often adopted in the design of saliency detection approaches is the Feature Integration Theory (FIT). According to FIT, attention serves as a mechanism to coherently combine features for the perception of objects. Therefore, starting from , eye fixations are commonly predicted by directly conjoining saliency activations from multiple channels, which can be global and local channels, multiple features and so on. Anatomical and physiological studies have shown that human visual system is organized hierarchically, which is believed to be advantageous in efficient processing of visual input. Computational studies have shown that hierarchical models (e.g. HMAX, CDBN) are effective for object recognition. Most saliency detection models, however, do not seriously take this into account. An obvious method to fill this gap is to develop hierarchical bottom-up models for saliency detection in the manner of HMAX, CDBN and the like. But there exists theoretical alternatives. The Reverse Hierarchy Theory (RHT) argues that parallel feedforward feature activation acts implicitly at first to construct a coarse gist of the scene, while explicit perception incrementally incorporates fine details via feedback control. This theory potentially has tremendous applications in computer vision including image segmentation, object recognition and scene understanding, however, computational studies are scarce. In this paper, we present an effective model based on RHT for saliency detection, which proves that RHT is helpful at least in this particular computer vision application. As for this application, a more direct evidence for the proposed model refers to a psychophysical study which showed that fixations from low-resolution images could predict fixations on higher-resolution images. . Our main idea is to model the coarse-to-fine dynamics of visual perception. We take a simple strategy to construct a visual hierarchy by inputting images at different layers with different scales, obtained by downsampling the original image. The higher layers receive coarser input and lower layers receive finer input. On each layer, saliency is defined as unpredictability in coarse-to-fine reconstruction through image super-resolution. The saliency on each layer is then fused into fixation estimate with a probabilistic model that mimics reverse propagation of attention. Throughout the paper, we call the proposed model a reverse hierarchy model (RHM). The coarse-to-fine dynamics, however, is not the only property of RHT. In fact, RHT is closely related to the biased competition theory of attention, which claims that attentional competition is biased by either stimulus-driven or task-dependent factors. Our model deals with fixation prediction in the free viewing task, which can be regarded as an implementation of the stimulus-driven bias. In addition, the image pyramid is a very coarse approximation of the highly complex structure of the visual hierarchy in the brain, which only utilizes the fact of increasing receptive field sizes along the hierarchy. Therefore, some closely related concepts to RHT, such as perceptual learning, would not be discussed in the paper. 2 Related Work The majority of computational attention modeling studies follow the Feature Integration Theory. In particular, the pioneering work by first explored the computational aspect of FIT by searching for center-surround patterns across multiple feature channels and image scales. This method was further extended through integration of color contrast, symmetry, etc. Random Center Surround Saliency adopted a similar center-surround heuristic but with center size and region randomly sampled. introduced a graph-based model that treated feature maps as fully connected nodes, while the nodes communicated according to their dissimilarity and distance in a Markovian way. Saliency was activated as the equilibrium distribution. Several saliency models adopted a probabilistic approach and modeled the statistics of image features. and Baldi defined saliency as surprise that arised from the divergence of prior and posterior belief. SUN was a Bayesian framework using natural statistics, in which bottom-up saliency was defined as self-information. proposed an attention model based on information maximization of image patches. defined the saliency by computing the Hotelling’s T-squared statistics of each multi-scale feature channel. considered saliency in a discriminative setting by defining the KL-divergence between features and class labels. A special class of saliency detection schemes was frequency-domain methods. proposed a spectral residual method, which defined saliency as irregularities in amplitude information. explored the phase information in the frequency domain with a Quaternion Fourier Transform. Recently, introduced a simple image descriptor, based on which a competitive fast saliency detection algorithm was devised. Different from our proposal, the conventional practice in fusing saliency at different image scales and feature channels was through linear combination. proposed a model that combined a global saliency model AIM and a local model through linear addition of normalized maps. Some models learned the linear combination weights for feature channels. trained a linear SVM from human eye fixation data to optimally combine the activation of several low-, mid- and high-level features. With a similar idea, adopted a regression-based approach. Our model is characterized by a top-down flow of information. But it differs from most existing saliency detection models that incorporate top-down components such as in two aspects. First, a biased prior (e.g., context clues, object features, task-related factors) is often needed in those models, serving as the goal of top-down modulation, which is not necessary in our model. Second, hierarchical structure of the visual cortex is not considered in those models, but plays a significant role in our model. Nevertheless, there were a few preliminary studies trying to make use of the hierarchical structure for saliency detection and attention modeling. The Selective Tuning Model was such a model. It was a biologically plausible neural network that modeled visual attention as a forward winner-takes-all process among units in each visual layer. A recent study used hierarchical structure to combine multi-scale saliency, with a hierarchical inference procedure that enforces the saliency of a region to be consistent across different layers. 2 3 Saliency from Image Super-Resolution In this section, a coarse-to-fine saliency model based on image super-resolution is presented. We consider an image at two consecutive scales in an image pyramid: a coarse one Il and a fine one Ih. Inspired by RHT, we define saliency as details in Ih that are unpredictable from Il. In the next section, we discuss how to fuse saliency on each layer of the pyramid into fixation estimate. 3.1 Saliency as Unpredictability Predicting Ih using the information of Il is closely related to image super-resolution, which has been extensively studied using techniques including Markov random field, example-based learning, compressive sensing, etc. In patch-based representation of images, the problem is to predict a high- resolution H × H patch xh ∈Ih from its low-resolution L × L counterpart xl ∈Il. For convenience of notation, we also use xh and xl as H2 and L2 dimensional vectors, which are computed by reshaping the corresponding patches. Then xl is obtained by blurring and downsampling xh: xl = GBxh, (1) where B denotes a H2 × H2 blurring matrix (throughout the paper a Gaussian matrix is used) and G represents a L2 × H2 downsampling matrix. Let zh denote the reconstructed patch by some method A, which summarizes the best knowledge one can recover from the coarse perception of xl, via A. The reconstruction error of zh from xh, naturally represents the fine-scale information that cannot be recovered. Therefore, we define saliency S(xh|xl) as the Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE): S(xh|zh) = ||xh −zh||2 ||xh||2 (2) The mean squared error is normalized so that S(xh|xl) is robust to variations of the patch energy ||xh||2. 3.2 Coarse-to-Fine Reconstruction The reconstruction from the coarse scale subject to the constraint (1) is actually not well-defined, since given a low-resolution patch xl, there exists an infinite number of possible high-resolution patches xh. To resolve this issue, the basic idea is to incorporate some prior knowledge, which inherits from the properties of natural images. In what follows we discuss several possible reconstruction schemes with increasingly sophisticated prior knowledge. Linear Reconstruction (LR). Consider a trivial case: the coarse patch xl = Bxh, is just the blurred version and we do nothing but output zh = xl. Therefore, no prior is used in this case. Saliency can be computed according to (2). As shown in Fig. 2, this method assigns more saliency to patches containing many high-frequency components like edges and textures. Bicubic Interpolation (BI). If we reconstruct xh using bicubic interpolation, then we utilize a smoothness prior in image interpolation. Although this approach concentrates less on edges than the linear reconstruction, its prediction is still far from the ground truth. See Fig. 2. With LR or BI, the saliency computed in (2) is the normalized l2-norm of the Laplacian pyramid. In addition, the two techniques can be used to implement the center-surround strategy adopted in some saliency models, e.g. . Compressive Sensing (CS). We now consider a more sophisticated prior of image structure – sparsity. According to this prior, any patch xh of a high-resolution image can be sparsely approximated by a linear combination of items in a dictionary Dh: xh ≈Dhα, (3) for some sparse coefficients α that satisfies ||α||0 ≤K for some small K. Assuming α is sparse, the theory of compressive sensing states that α can be recovered from sufficient measurements xl = GBxh by solving the following optimization problem: min ||α||0subjectto||Dlα −xl|| < ϵ, (4) where Dl = GBDh, denotes the blurred and downsampled dictionary Dh, and ϵ is the allowed error tolerance. This is hard to solve, and in practice the following relaxed problem is often solved: min ||α||1subjectto||Dlα −xl|| < ϵ. (5)",1,,,,
P024.pdf,"Turning the Tables: Exploring Subtle Vulnerabilities in Machine Learning Model Abstract This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of label-only backdoor attacks in machine learning. In these attacks, adversaries corrupt only the training labels, without modifying the input data (e.g., images), to surreptitiously implant backdoors into machine learning models. We introduce FLIP (Flipping Labels to Inject Poison), a novel label-only backdoor attack mechanism designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the training process. The core idea behind FLIP is to strategically manipulate a small subset of training labels, forcing the model to learn a hidden mapping between a specific trigger (e.g., a subtle alteration in the label distribution) and a predetermined target output. This allows the attacker to control the model’s predictions for inputs associated with the trigger, even if those inputs are otherwise correctly classified by the model. 1 Introduction This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of label-only backdoor attacks in machine learning [1, 2]. In these attacks, adversaries corrupt only the training labels, without modifying the input data (e.g., images), to surreptitiously implant backdoors into machine learning models. This contrasts with traditional backdoor attacks that require manipulating the input data itself, making label- only attacks a more subtle and potentially harder-to-detect threat. The ease with which an attacker can manipulate labels, especially in crowd-sourced annotation settings, makes this a significant concern for the security and trustworthiness of machine learning systems. The potential for widespread impact necessitates a thorough investigation into the vulnerabilities and defenses against such attacks. This work aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of this emerging threat landscape. We introduce FLIP (Flipping Labels to Inject Poison), a novel label-only backdoor attack mechanism designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the training process. The core idea behind FLIP is to strategically manipulate a small subset of training labels, forcing the model to learn a hidden mapping between a specific trigger (e.g., a subtle alteration in the label distribution, or a specific pattern in the labels themselves) and a predetermined target output. This allows the attacker to control the model’s predictions for inputs associated with the trigger, even if those inputs are otherwise correctly classified by the model. The subtlety of the attack lies in its reliance on label manipulation alone, making it difficult to detect using traditional methods focused on input data anomalies. The effectiveness of this approach hinges on the model’s ability to learn spurious correlations between seemingly innocuous label patterns and the desired target output. The effectiveness of FLIP is evaluated across various scenarios, including those that mimic real-world data collection challenges. We explore the impact of noisy labels, often encountered in crowd- sourced annotation settings, on the success rate of the attack. We investigate the robustness of FLIP against different defense mechanisms, such as data augmentation and adversarial training, commonly employed to enhance model robustness. Our experiments systematically vary key attack parameters, such as the number of poisoned labels and the strength of the trigger, to understand the trade-offs involved. This allows us to characterize the attack’s effectiveness under different conditions and to identify potential weaknesses that could be exploited for defense. The results provide valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of machine learning models to this type of attack. . We analyze the trade-offs between Clean Test Accuracy (CTA) and Poison Test Accuracy (PTA) under different attack parameters. This analysis reveals a complex relationship between the number of poisoned labels, the strength of the trigger, and the overall performance of the model. We observe that while increasing the number of poisoned labels generally improves PTA, it can also lead to a significant drop in CTA, indicating a trade-off between the effectiveness of the backdoor and the model’s overall accuracy on clean data. This trade-off is crucial for attackers to consider when designing their attacks, as they need to balance the effectiveness of the backdoor with the risk of detection. A careful analysis of this trade-off is essential for developing effective defense strategies. The efficiency of FLIP is another key aspect of our study. We demonstrate that FLIP requires significantly fewer poisoned labels compared to traditional backdoor attacks that modify the input data. This makes FLIP a particularly attractive option for attackers who have limited access to the training data or who wish to remain undetected. The reduced computational overhead associated with label manipulation also contributes to the efficiency of FLIP. This makes it a practical threat even in resource-constrained environments, highlighting the need for robust defenses that can operate efficiently as well. The low cost and high effectiveness of FLIP underscore the severity of the threat it poses. Our experiments further explore the applicability of FLIP in the context of knowledge distillation [3]. We show that FLIP can effectively implant backdoors into student models trained using knowledge distillation from a clean teacher model. This highlights the vulnerability of knowledge distillation to label-only backdoor attacks, suggesting that the distillation process itself may inadvertently transfer the backdoor from the teacher to the student model. This finding underscores the importance of securing the training data and processes at every stage of model development, emphasizing the need for a holistic security approach. The implications for model training pipelines are significant and warrant further investigation. The implications of our findings are significant for the security and trustworthiness of machine learning systems. The ease with which label-only backdoors can be implanted, even under realistic conditions, necessitates the development of new defense mechanisms specifically designed to detect and mitigate these types of attacks. Future research should focus on developing robust methods for detecting subtle label manipulations and for designing training procedures that are less susceptible to label-only backdoor attacks. This includes exploring techniques that leverage label consistency checks, anomaly detection, and robust model training methods. The development of such defenses is crucial for mitigating the risks posed by FLIP and similar attacks. Finally, our work contributes to a broader understanding of the vulnerabilities of machine learning models to adversarial attacks. The ability to implant backdoors using only label manipulation highlights the importance of considering the entire training pipeline, including data collection, annotation, and model training, when assessing the security of machine learning systems. This holistic approach is crucial for developing more secure and trustworthy AI systems. Further research is needed to explore the potential for extending FLIP to other machine learning tasks and model architectures, and to investigate the broader implications of label-only attacks on the trustworthiness of AI. The findings presented here represent a significant step towards a more comprehensive understanding of this emerging threat. 2 Related Work The field of adversarial attacks on machine learning models has seen significant growth in recent years, with a focus on various attack strategies and defense mechanisms. Early work primarily concentrated on input-based attacks, where adversaries manipulate the input data (e.g., images) to cause misclassification [4, 5]. These attacks often involve adding carefully crafted perturbations to the input, making them difficult to detect. However, the reliance on input manipulation limits the attacker’s reach, particularly in scenarios where direct access to the input data is restricted. Our work explores a different paradigm, focusing on label-only attacks, which offer a more subtle and potentially harder-to-detect approach. Label-only attacks represent a relatively nascent area of research, with fewer studies dedicated to their analysis and mitigation. Existing literature on data poisoning often focuses on manipulating the training data itself, including both features and labels [6, 7]. However, these approaches often require a significant level of access to the training dataset, which may not always be feasible for an 2 attacker. In contrast, label-only attacks leverage the inherent vulnerabilities in the label annotation process, making them a more practical threat in real-world scenarios where data annotation is often outsourced or crowd-sourced. The subtlety of these attacks makes them particularly challenging to detect and defend against. Several studies have explored the impact of noisy labels on model training and performance [8, 9]. While these studies primarily focus on the effects of random label noise, they provide a foundation for understanding how label inconsistencies can affect model learning. Our work builds upon this foundation by investigating the impact of strategically injected label noise, specifically designed to implant backdoors. The strategic manipulation of labels, as opposed to random noise, allows for a more targeted and effective attack, highlighting the unique challenges posed by label-only backdoor attacks. The concept of backdoor attacks has been extensively studied in the context of input data manipulation [10, 11]. These attacks typically involve modifying a subset of the training data to trigger a specific misclassification. However, label-only backdoor attacks differ significantly in their approach, relying solely on label manipulation to achieve the same effect. This distinction necessitates the development of novel defense mechanisms specifically tailored to address the unique characteristics of label-only attacks. The subtlety of label manipulation makes detection significantly more challenging compared to input-based attacks. Knowledge distillation has emerged as a powerful technique for training efficient student models using knowledge from larger teacher models [12, 13]. While knowledge distillation offers significant benefits in terms of model compression and efficiency, our work highlights its vulnerability to label- only backdoor attacks. The potential for backdoors to propagate from teacher to student models underscores the importance of securing the entire training pipeline, including the teacher model and the distillation process itself. This finding emphasizes the need for a holistic security approach that considers all stages of model development. Our work contributes to the broader literature on adversarial machine learning by exploring a novel attack vector—label-only backdoors. This expands the understanding of vulnerabilities in machine learning systems beyond traditional input-based attacks. The findings presented in this paper highlight the need for a more comprehensive approach to security, considering not only the input data but also the entire training process, including data annotation and model training techniques. Future research should focus on developing robust defenses against label-only attacks, considering the unique challenges they pose. This includes exploring techniques that leverage label consistency checks, anomaly detection, and robust model training methods. 3 Background Label-only backdoor attacks represent a significant and emerging threat to the security and trustwor- thiness of machine learning models. Unlike traditional backdoor attacks that involve manipulating input data, these attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the training process by corrupting only the training labels. This subtle manipulation can lead to the implantation of backdoors that are difficult to detect using conventional methods. The ease with which labels can be altered, particularly in crowd-sourced annotation settings, makes this a particularly concerning vulnerability. The potential for widespread impact necessitates a thorough investigation into the vulnerabilities and defenses against such attacks. This research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of this emerging threat landscape and to inform the development of robust countermeasures. The focus is on understanding the mechanisms by which these attacks operate, their effectiveness under various conditions, and the trade-offs involved in their implementation. The existing literature on data poisoning primarily focuses on manipulating both features and labels within the training dataset. However, these approaches often require significant access to the training data, which may not always be feasible for an attacker. Label-only attacks offer a more practical alternative, leveraging the inherent vulnerabilities in the label annotation process. The subtlety of these attacks makes them particularly challenging to detect and defend against, as they do not involve readily apparent modifications to the input data itself. This necessitates the development of novel defense mechanisms specifically tailored to address the unique characteristics of label-only attacks. The challenge lies in identifying subtle patterns in the label distribution that might indicate malicious manipulation. 3 Several studies have explored the impact of noisy labels on model training and performance. These studies primarily focus on the effects of random label noise, providing a foundation for understanding how label inconsistencies can affect model learning. However, label-only backdoor attacks differ significantly in that the label noise is strategically injected, rather than being random. This strategic manipulation allows for a more targeted and effective attack, resulting in the implantation of a backdoor that triggers specific misclassifications. The ability to control the nature and location of the label noise is crucial to the success of the attack. Understanding the interplay between the level of noise, the strategic placement of poisoned labels, and the resulting model behavior is key to developing effective defenses. The concept of backdoor attacks has been extensively studied in the context of input data manipu- lation. These attacks typically involve modifying a subset of the training data to trigger a specific misclassification when a particular trigger is present in the input. However, label-only backdoor attacks differ significantly in their approach, relying solely on label manipulation to achieve the same effect. This distinction necessitates the development of novel defense mechanisms specifically tailored to address the unique characteristics of label-only attacks. The subtlety of label manipulation makes detection significantly more challenging compared to input-based attacks, requiring more sophisticated methods for identifying anomalous patterns in the label distribution. Knowledge distillation is a powerful technique for training efficient student models using knowledge from larger teacher models. While knowledge distillation offers significant benefits in terms of model compression and efficiency, it also introduces potential vulnerabilities to label-only backdoor attacks. If the teacher model is compromised, the backdoor can propagate to the student model during the distillation process. This highlights the importance of securing the entire training pipeline, including the teacher model and the distillation process itself. A holistic security approach is crucial to mitigate the risks associated with knowledge distillation in the presence of label-only backdoor attacks. The potential for cascading vulnerabilities underscores the need for robust security measures at every stage of model development. The development of robust defenses against label-only backdoor attacks is a critical area of future research. These defenses should focus on detecting subtle label manipulations and designing training procedures that are less susceptible to these attacks. Techniques that leverage label consistency checks, anomaly detection, and robust model training methods are promising avenues for exploration. The challenge lies in developing methods that can effectively identify malicious label manipulations without significantly impacting the performance of the model on clean data. A balance must be struck between security and accuracy, ensuring that the defenses do not unduly compromise the model’s utility. The development of such defenses is crucial for mitigating the risks posed by label-only backdoor attacks and ensuring the trustworthiness of machine learning systems. 4 Methodology This section details the methodology employed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of label- only backdoor attacks using the FLIP (Flipping Labels to Inject Poison) mechanism. Our approach involves a comprehensive evaluation across various scenarios, including those that mimic real-world data collection challenges and model training paradigms. The core of our methodology centers around strategically manipulating a subset of training labels to induce a hidden mapping between a specific trigger (a pattern in the label sequence) and a predetermined target output. This manipulation is designed to force the model to learn a spurious correlation, enabling backdoor control without modifying the input data itself. The effectiveness of FLIP is assessed across multiple datasets and model architectures. We systemat- ically vary key attack parameters, including the percentage of poisoned labels, the strength of the trigger (defined by the complexity and consistency of the label pattern), and the type of trigger used. The choice of datasets and models ensures generalizability and robustness of our findings. We employ standard evaluation metrics, including Clean Test Accuracy (CTA) and Poison Test Accuracy (PTA), to quantify the impact of the attack. CTA measures the model’s accuracy on clean, unpoisoned data, while PTA measures the model’s accuracy on data associated with the trigger. The trade-off between CTA and PTA is a crucial aspect of our analysis, providing insights into the attack’s effectiveness versus its detectability. 4 To simulate real-world scenarios, we introduce label noise into the training data. This noise is inde- pendent of the strategically injected poisoned labels, mimicking the imperfections often encountered in crowd-sourced annotation settings. By varying the level of label noise, we assess the robustness of FLIP against noisy labels. We hypothesize that even with a significant level of random label noise, FLIP will remain effective due to the strategic nature of the poisoned labels. This analysis provides valuable insights into the attack’s resilience in less-than-ideal data conditions. Furthermore, we investigate the robustness of FLIP against common defense mechanisms. Specifi- cally, we evaluate the attack’s effectiveness against data augmentation techniques and adversarial training. Data augmentation involves artificially expanding the training dataset by applying various transformations to the existing data. Adversarial training aims to improve model robustness by training the model on adversarial examples, which are designed to fool the model. By testing FLIP against these defenses, we assess its resilience to commonly employed security measures. This analysis helps to identify potential weaknesses in existing defenses and inform the development of more robust countermeasures. The efficiency of FLIP is evaluated by comparing the number of poisoned labels required for successful backdoor implantation with that of traditional input-based backdoor attacks. We expect FLIP to require significantly fewer poisoned labels, making it a more efficient and stealthy attack. This efficiency is a key advantage of label-only attacks, as it reduces the attacker’s effort and risk of detection. The computational overhead associated with label manipulation is also significantly lower than that of input data modification, further enhancing the practicality of FLIP. Finally, we explore the applicability of FLIP in the context of knowledge distillation. We train a student model using knowledge distillation from a clean teacher model, where the teacher model’s training data has been subjected to a FLIP attack. We investigate whether the backdoor is transferred from the teacher to the student model during the distillation process. This analysis highlights the potential for cascading vulnerabilities in model training pipelines and underscores the importance of securing the training data and processes at every stage of model development. The results provide insights into the vulnerability of knowledge distillation to label-only backdoor attacks. The experimental setup involves a rigorous comparison across various datasets, model architectures, and attack parameters. The results are statistically analyzed to ensure the reliability and significance of our findings. The comprehensive nature of our methodology allows for a thorough evaluation of FLIP’s effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness, providing valuable insights into the challenges posed by label-only backdoor attacks. This detailed analysis informs the development of more effective defense mechanisms and contributes to a broader understanding of the security vulnerabilities in machine learning systems. Our methodology emphasizes a holistic approach, considering various aspects of the attack, including its effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and applicability in different contexts. This comprehensive evaluation provides a robust assessment of the threat posed by FLIP and informs the development of effective countermeasures. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the vulnerabilities of machine learning systems to label-only backdoor attacks and highlight the need for a more holistic approach to security in the design and deployment of machine learning models. 5 Experiments This section details the experimental setup and results obtained to evaluate the effectiveness of FLIP (Flipping Labels to Inject Poison), a novel label-only backdoor attack mechanism. Our experiments were designed to comprehensively assess FLIP’s performance across various scenarios, including those that mimic real-world data collection challenges and model training paradigms. We focused on evaluating FLIP’s robustness, efficiency, and the trade-offs between Clean Test Accuracy (CTA) and Poison Test Accuracy (PTA). The experiments involved systematically manipulating a subset of training labels to induce a hidden mapping between a specific trigger (a pattern in the label sequence) and a predetermined target output. This manipulation forced the model to learn a spurious correlation, enabling backdoor control without modifying the input data itself. Our experiments were conducted using three benchmark datasets: MNIST [14], CIFAR-10 [15], and Fashion-MNIST [16]. We employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as our model architecture, specifically using variations of LeNet-5 for MNIST and VGG-like architectures for CIFAR-10 and 5 Fashion-MNIST. The choice of datasets and models ensured generalizability and robustness of our findings. For each dataset, we varied the percentage of poisoned labels (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) and the strength of the trigger (defined by the complexity and consistency of the label pattern). The trigger was implemented as a specific sequence of labels within the training set. We used standard evaluation metrics, including Clean Test Accuracy (CTA) and Poison Test Accuracy (PTA), to quantify the impact of the attack. To simulate real-world scenarios with noisy labels, we introduced random label noise into the training data. The level of noise was varied (0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%), and the noise was independent of the strategically injected poisoned labels. This allowed us to assess FLIP’s robustness against noisy labels, mimicking the imperfections often encountered in crowd-sourced annotation settings. We observed that even with a significant level of random label noise, FLIP remained remarkably effective, demonstrating its resilience in less-than-ideal data conditions. The results are presented in Table 1. Table 1: Impact of Label Noise on FLIP Effectiveness Dataset Noise Level (%) CTA (%) PTA (%) MNIST 0 97.2 99.5 MNIST 10 96.5 98.8 MNIST 20 95.1 97.9 MNIST 30 93.8 96.5 We also investigated FLIP’s robustness against data augmentation and adversarial training. Data augmentation techniques, such as random cropping and horizontal flipping, were applied to the training data. Adversarial training was performed using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) [17]. The results showed that while these defenses reduced the effectiveness of FLIP, they did not completely eliminate it. This highlights the need for more robust defense mechanisms specifically designed to mitigate label-only backdoor attacks. The detailed results of these experiments are presented in Table 2. Table 2: FLIP’s Robustness Against Defenses Defense Dataset CTA (%) PTA (%) None MNIST 97.2 99.5 Data Augmentation MNIST 96.0 98.1 Adversarial Training MNIST 94.5 96.8 The efficiency of FLIP was evaluated by comparing the number of poisoned labels required for successful backdoor implantation with that of traditional input-based backdoor attacks. Our results demonstrated that FLIP required significantly fewer poisoned labels to achieve comparable PTA, highlighting its efficiency and stealth. This makes FLIP a particularly attractive option for attackers with limited access to the training data or who wish to remain undetected. Finally, we explored the applicability of FLIP in the context of knowledge distillation. We trained a student model using knowledge distillation from a teacher model whose training data had been subjected to a FLIP attack. The results showed that the backdoor was successfully transferred from the teacher to the student model, highlighting the vulnerability of knowledge distillation to label-only backdoor attacks. This underscores the importance of securing the training data and processes at every stage of model development. The detailed results of these experiments are presented in Table 3. Table 3: Knowledge Distillation and Backdoor Transfer Model CTA (%) PTA (%) Teacher (Poisoned) 95.0 98.0 Student (Distilled) 94.2 97.5 Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of FLIP, highlighting the significant threat posed by label-only backdoor attacks. The results underscore the need for developing new 6 defense mechanisms specifically designed to detect and mitigate these types of attacks. Future research should focus on developing robust methods for detecting subtle label manipulations and designing training procedures that are less susceptible to label-only backdoor attacks. 6 Results This section presents the results of our experiments evaluating the effectiveness of FLIP (Flipping Labels to Inject Poison), a novel label-only backdoor attack. We conducted experiments across three benchmark datasets: MNIST [14], CIFAR-10 [15], and Fashion-MNIST [16], using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) of varying architectures. Our primary evaluation metrics were Clean Test Accuracy (CTA) and Poison Test Accuracy (PTA), measuring the model’s performance on clean and poisoned data, respectively. We systematically varied the percentage of poisoned labels (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%), the strength of the trigger (a pattern in the label sequence), and the level of random label noise (0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%) to assess FLIP’s robustness under diverse conditions. The results demonstrate a clear trade-off between CTA and PTA, highlighting the challenges in balancing backdoor effectiveness with the risk of detection. Our findings consistently show that FLIP is highly effective in implanting backdoors, even with a significant amount of random label noise. Table 4 presents the CTA and PTA for MNIST under varying noise levels. As expected, increasing the noise level reduces both CTA and PTA, but even at 30% noise, PTA remains significantly high, indicating the resilience of FLIP to label noise. Similar trends were observed for CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, demonstrating the generalizability of FLIP’s effectiveness across different datasets. The strategic nature of the poisoned labels allows FLIP to overcome the effects of random noise, making it a potent threat even in real-world scenarios with imperfect label annotations. Table 4: Impact of Label Noise on FLIP Effectiveness (MNIST) Noise Level (%) CTA (%) PTA (%) Poisoned Labels (%) 0 97.2 ± 0.5 99.5 ± 0.2 10 10 96.5 ± 0.7 98.8 ± 0.4 10 20 95.1 ± 0.9 97.9 ± 0.6 10 30 93.8 ± 1.1 96.5 ± 0.8 10 We further investigated FLIP’s robustness against common defense mechanisms, including data augmentation and adversarial training. Table 5 shows the results for MNIST. While both defenses reduced PTA, they did not eliminate the backdoor effect. Data augmentation, involving random cropping and horizontal flipping, had a more significant impact than adversarial training using FGSM [17]. This suggests that defenses focusing on input data transformations may be more effective against FLIP than those targeting adversarial examples. However, the persistent backdoor effect even under these defenses highlights the need for more sophisticated defense strategies. Table 5: FLIP’s Robustness Against Defenses (MNIST, 10% Poisoned Labels) Defense CTA (%) PTA (%) None 97.2 99.5 Data Augmentation 96.0 98.1 Adversarial Training (FGSM) 94.5 96.8 Our analysis of the trade-off between CTA and PTA revealed a complex relationship dependent on the percentage of poisoned labels and trigger strength. Generally, increasing the percentage of poisoned labels improved PTA but at the cost of reduced CTA. This trade-off is crucial for attackers, who must balance backdoor effectiveness with the risk of detection based on reduced overall model accuracy. Figure 1 (Illustrative example - replace with actual figure) visually represents this trade-off for MNIST. This highlights the importance of developing detection methods sensitive to subtle changes in model accuracy. FLIP’s efficiency was remarkable. It consistently required significantly fewer poisoned labels than traditional input-based backdoor attacks to achieve comparable PTA. This makes FLIP a particularly 7 Figure 1: Illustrative CTA vs. PTA Trade-off for MNIST attractive option for attackers with limited access to the training data or seeking to remain undetected. The low computational overhead associated with label manipulation further enhances its practicality. This efficiency underscores the severity of the threat posed by label-only backdoor attacks. Finally, our experiments on knowledge distillation demonstrated that FLIP can effectively implant backdoors into student models trained using knowledge from a poisoned teacher model. This highlights the vulnerability of knowledge distillation to label-only backdoor attacks and underscores the importance of securing the entire training pipeline. The ease with which backdoors can propagate through the distillation process emphasizes the need for robust security measures at every stage of model development. These findings have significant implications for the security and trustworthiness of machine learning systems. 7 Conclusion This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of FLIP (Flipping Labels to Inject Poison), a novel label-only backdoor attack that manipulates training labels to implant backdoors in machine learning models without modifying input data. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this attack, highlighting a significant vulnerability in the machine learning training pipeline. The ease with which FLIP can be implemented, even under realistic conditions with noisy labels, underscores the need for enhanced security measures. The results consistently show that FLIP achieves high Poison Test Accuracy (PTA) while maintaining relatively high Clean Test Accuracy (CTA), demonstrating a successful trade-off between backdoor effectiveness and the risk of detection based on overall model accuracy. The robustness of FLIP against common defense mechanisms, such as data augmentation and adversarial training, is another key finding. While these defenses mitigate the attack’s effectiveness to some extent, they do not eliminate it entirely. This hig",,,,,

P025.pdf,"Scene Comprehension Through Image Analysis with an Extensive Array of Categories and Context at the Scene Level Abstract This research introduces a unique approach to scene parsing that is nonparametric, which enhances the precision and expands the scope of foreground categories within images of scenes. Initially, the accuracy of label likelihood at the superpixel level is improved by combining likelihood scores from multiple probabilistic classifiers. This method improves classification accuracy and enhances the representation of categories that are less frequently represented. The second advancement involves the integration of semantic context into the parsing procedure by utilizing global label costs. Instead of relying on sets derived from image retrieval, the technique described assigns a comprehensive likelihood estimate to each label, which is subsequently incorporated into the overall energy function. The effectiveness of the system is assessed using two expansive datasets, SIFTflow and LMSun. The system demonstrates performance that is at the forefront of the field on the SIFTflow dataset and achieves outcomes that are close to setting new records on the LMSun dataset. 1 Introduction The task of scene parsing involves assigning semantic labels to every pixel within an image of a scene. Algorithms for image parsing attempt to categorize different types of scenes, both indoors and outdoors, such as a shoreline, a roadway, an urban environment, and an airport. Numerous systems have been developed to categorize each pixel in an image semantically. A significant obstacle for image parsing methods is the considerable variability in recognition rates across different types of classes. Background classes, which usually cover a significant area of the image’s pixels, often have a uniform look and are identified with great accuracy. Foreground classes, which usually take up fewer pixels in the image, have changeable forms and might be hidden or set up in various ways. These kinds of classes represent noticeable parts of the image that frequently grab a viewer’s attention. However, their recognition rates are often much lower than those of background classes, making them frequent examples of unsuccessful recognition. Impressive results have been obtained by parametric scene parsing techniques on datasets with a limited number of labels. Nevertheless, for considerably bigger datasets with a lot of labels, using these techniques becomes more challenging because of the increased demands on learning and optimization. Nonparametric image parsing techniques have recently been introduced to tackle the growing variety of scene types and semantic labels effectively. These methods usually begin by reducing the com- plexity of the problem from individual pixels to superpixels. Initially, a set of images is selected, consisting of training images that bear the closest visual resemblance to the image being queried. The potential labels for a specific image are limited to those found in the selected set of images. Subsequently, the probability scores for the classification of superpixels are determined by matching visual characteristics. Ultimately, context is applied by reducing an energy function that includes both the expense of the data and information on how often classes appear together in nearby superpixels. . A shared difficulty encountered by nonparametric parsing methods is the phase of image retrieval. Even though image retrieval helps narrow down the number of labels to think about, it’s seen as a very important step in the process. There’s no opportunity to correct the mistake if the correct labels are not among the images that were retrieved. It has been reported that mistakes in retrieval are the main reason for most unsuccessful cases. A novel nonparametric image parsing algorithm is proposed in this work, aiming for enhanced overall precision and improved identification rates for classes that are less commonly represented. An efficient system is developed that can adapt to an ever-growing quantity of labels. The contributions made are outlined as follows: 1. Superpixel label likelihood scores are improved by merging classifiers. The system merges the output probabilities from several classification models to generate a more equitable score for each label at every superpixel. The weights for merging the scores are determined by employing a likelihood normalization technique on the training set in an automated manner. 2. Semantic context is integrated within a probabilistic structure. To prevent the removal of important labels that cannot be retrieved later, a retrieval set is not structured. Instead, label costs are utilized, which are determined from the global contextual relationships of labels in analogous scenes, to obtain enhanced parsing outcomes. The system developed achieves top-tier per-pixel recognition accuracy on two extensive datasets: SIFTflow, which includes 2688 images with 33 labels, and LMSun, which has 45576 images with 232 labels. 2 Related Work Several techniques for scene parsing, both parametric and nonparametric, have been suggested. The nonparametric systems that try to cover a wide range of semantic classes are very similar to the method. Different methods are used to improve the overall effectiveness of nonparametric parsing. The authors merge region-parsing with outputs from per-exemplar SVM detectors. Object masks are transferred by per-exemplar detectors into the test image for segmentation. Their method greatly improves overall accuracy, but it requires a lot of computer power. It’s hard to scale because data terms need to be calibrated using a batch of fine training in a leave-one-out way, which is hard to do. Superpixels from rare classes are specifically added to the retrieval set to make them more visible. The authors filter the list of labels for a test image by doing an image retrieval step, and query time is used to add more samples to rare classes. The way superpixels are classified, how rare classes are recognized, and how semantic context is applied are all different in this system. By combining classification costs from different contextual models, a more balanced set of label costs is produced, which promotes the representation of foreground classes. Instead of using image retrieval, global label costs are used in the inference step. The value of semantic context has been thoroughly investigated in numerous visual recognition algorithms. Context has been employed to enhance the overall labeling performance through a feedback mechanism in nonparametric scene parsing systems. Initial labeling of superpixels in a query image is utilized to modify the training set by adjusting for recognized background classes, thereby enhancing the visibility of uncommon classes. The objective is to enhance the image retrieval set by reintroducing segments of uncommon classes. A semantic global descriptor is generated. Image retrieval is enhanced by merging the semantic descriptor with the visual descriptors. Context is added by creating global and local context descriptors based on classification likelihood maps. The method described differs from these methods as it does not employ context at each superpixel when calculating a global context descriptor. Instead, contextual information across the entire image is taken into account. Contextually relevant outcomes are produced by deducing label correlations in comparable scene images. Additionally, there is no retrieval set that needs to be enriched. Rather, the global context is structured within a probabilistic framework, where label costs are calculated across the whole image. Furthermore, the global context is executed in real time without any preliminary training. Another method of image parsing that doesn’t use retrieval sets is where image labeling is done by moving annotations from a graph of patch matches across image sets. But this method needs a lot of memory, which makes it hard to scale for big datasets. 2 The presented method draws inspiration from the combination of classifier techniques in machine learning, which have demonstrated the ability to enhance the capabilities of individual classifiers. Several fusion methods have been effectively applied in various fields of computer vision, including detecting faces, annotating images with multiple labels, tracking objects, and recognizing characters. Nonetheless, the classifiers that make up these systems and the ways they are combined are very different from the framework, and the other methods have only been tested on small datasets. 3 Baseline Parsing Pipeline This section provides a summary of the basic image parsing system, which is composed of three stages: feature extraction, label likelihood estimation at superpixels, and inference. Afterward, contributions are presented: enhancing likelihoods at superpixels and calculating label costs for global context at the scene level. 3.1 Segmentation and Feature Extraction To reduce the complexity of the task, the image is partitioned into superpixels. Extraction of superpixels from images begins by employing an efficient graph-based method. For each superpixel, 20 distinct types of local features are extracted to characterize its shape, appearance, texture, color, and position, adhering to established methods. In addition to these features, Fisher Vector (FV) descriptors are extracted at each superpixel using an established library. Computation of 128-dimensional dense SIFT feature descriptors is performed on five different patch sizes (8, 12, 16, 24, 30). A dictionary comprising 1024 words is constructed. Subsequently, the FV descriptors are retrieved and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to decrease their dimensionality to 512. Each superpixel is represented by a feature vector that has 2202 dimensions. 3.2 Label Likelihood Estimation The features obtained in the prior stage are utilized to determine label probabilities for each superpixel. Unlike conventional approaches, the possible labels for a test image are not restricted. Instead, the data term for the likelihood of each class label c C is computed, where C represents the total number of classes in the dataset. The normalized cost D(l<sub>si</sub> = c|s<sub>i</sub>) of assigning label c to superpixel s<sub>i</sub> is given by: D(lsi = c|si) = 1 − 1 1 + e−Lunbal(si,c) (1) where L<sub>unbal</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>, c) is the log-likelihood ratio score of label c, given by L<sub>unbal</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>, c) = 1/2 log(P(s<sub>i</sub>|c)/P(s<sub>i</sub>|¬c)), where ¬c = C c is the set of all labels except c, and P(s<sub>i</sub>|c) is the likelihood of superpixel s<sub>i</sub> given c. A boosted decision tree (BDT) model is trained to obtain the label likelihoods L<sub>unbal</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>, c). For implementation, a publicly accessible boostDT library is utilized. During this phase, the BDT model is trained using every superpixel in the training set, which constitutes an imbalanced distribution of class labels C. 3.3 Smoothing and Inference The optimization challenge is formulated as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation to determine the ultimate labeling L through Markov Random Field (MRF) inference. Using only the estimated likelihoods from the preceding section to categorize superpixels leads to imprecise classifications. Incorporating a smoothing term V(l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub>, l<sub>s<sub>j</sub></sub>) into the MRF energy function aims to address this problem by penalizing adjacent superpixels with semantically incongruous labels. The goal is to minimize the following energy function: E(L) = X si∈S D(lsi = c|si) + λ X (i,j)∈A V (lsi, lsj) (2) 3 where A represents the set of neighboring superpixel indices and V(l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub>, l<sub>s<sub>j</sub></sub>) denotes the penalty for assigning labels l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub> and l<sub>s<sub>j</sub></sub> to two adjacent pixels, calculated from occurrences in the training set combined with the constant Potts model following established methods. is the smoothing constant. Inference is conducted using the -expansion method with established code. 4 Improving Superpixel Label Costs Although foreground objects typically stand out the most in a picture of a scene, parsing algorithms frequently misclassify them. For instance, in an image of a city street, a person would usually first spot the individuals, signs, and vehicles before they would see the structures and the street. However, because of two primary factors, scene parsing algorithms frequently misclassify foreground regions as belonging to the surrounding background. Initially, in the superpixel classification phase, any classifier would naturally prefer classes that are more prevalent to reduce the overall training error. Secondly, during the MRF smoothing phase, a lot of the superpixels that were accurately identified as foreground objects are smoothed out by the background pixels around them. It is suggested that the label likelihood score at each superpixel be improved to obtain a more precise parsing output. Various classifiers are designed that provide supplementary information regarding the data. Subsequently, all the developed models are merged to produce a unified conclusion. An overview of the method for merging classifiers is displayed in Figure 1. During the testing phase, the label likelihood scores from all the BDT models are combined to generate the final scores for superpixels. 4.1 Fusing Classifiers The proposed method is inspired by ensemble classifier methods, which train several classifiers and merge them to enhance decision-making. These methods are especially helpful when the classifiers are distinct. In other words, the decrease in error is connected to the lack of correlation between the models that were trained. This means that the total error is decreased if the classifiers misclassify different data points. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that for large datasets, dividing the training set yields superior results compared to dividing the feature space. It has been observed that the classification error for a particular class is correlated with the average number of pixels it covers in the scene images, as indicated by the blue line in Figure 2. This is in line with what earlier methods found, which is that the rate of classification error is related to how often classes show up in the training set. However, it goes beyond that by taking into account how often the classes appear at the image level, which is meant to solve the problem of less-represented classes being smoothed out by a background class that is nearby. To achieve this, three BDT models are trained using the following training data criteria: (1) a balanced subsample of all classes C in the dataset, (2) a balanced subsample of classes that occupy an average of less than z The goal of these decisions is to lessen the correlation between the trained BDT models, as seen in Figure 2. The balanced classifiers are able to correctly identify some of the less-represented classes, but they make more mistakes on the more-represented classes. The unbalanced classifier, on the other hand, mostly misclassifies the less-represented classes. Combining the likelihoods from all the classifiers leads to an improved overall decision that enhances the representation of all classes (Figure 1). It was noticed that the addition of more classifiers did not enhance performance for any of the datasets. The ultimate expense of allocating a label c to a superpixel s<sub>i</sub> can subsequently be expressed as the amalgamation of the likelihood scores of all classifiers: D(lsi = c|si) = 1 − 1 1 + e−Lcomb(si,c) (3) where L<sub>comb</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>, c) represents the combined likelihood score obtained by the weighted sum of the scores from all classifiers: 4 Lcomb(si, c) = X j=1,2,3,4 wj(c)Lj(si, c) (4) where L<sub>j</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>, c) is the score from the j<sup>th</sup> classifier, and w<sub>j</sub>(c) is the normalized weight of the likelihood score of class c in the j<sup>th</sup> classifier. 4.2 Normalized Weight Learning The weights w w < sub > j < /sub > (c)]arelearnedforallclassesCinofflinesettingsusingthetrainingset.Theweightsarecalculate ˜wj(c) = 1 |Cj| P si∈S Lj(si, c) P ci∈C\c P si∈S Lj(si, ci) (5) where |C<sub>j</sub>| denotes the quantity of classes encompassed by the j<sup>th</sup> classifier and not covered by any other classifier with a fewer number of classes. The normalized weight w<sub>j</sub>(c) of class c can then be computed as: w<sub>j</sub>(c) = ~w<sub>j</sub>(c) / <sub>j=1,2,3,4</sub>(~w<sub>j</sub>(c)). Normalizing the output likelihoods in this way improves the likelihood that all classifiers will be taken into account in the outcome, with a focus on classes that are less represented. 5 Scene-Level Global Context When working with scene parsing challenges, including the scene’s semantics in the labeling process is beneficial. For example, if a scene is known to be a beach scene, labels such as sea, sand, and sky are expected to be found with a much greater probability than labels like car, building, or fence. The initial labeling results of a test image are used in estimating the likelihoods of all labels c C. The likelihoods are estimated globally over an image, i.e., there is a unique cost per label per image. The global label costs are then incorporated into a subsequent MRF inference stage to enhance the results. The presented method, in contrast to previous methods, does not restrict the number of labels to those found in the retrieval set. Instead, it utilizes the set to calculate the likelihood of class labels in a k-nn manner. The likelihoods are normalized by counts over the entire dataset and smoothed to provide an opportunity for labels not present in the retrieval set. The likelihoods are also used in MRF optimization, not for reducing the number of labels. 5.1 Context-Aware Global Label Costs It is proposed that semantic context be incorporated by using label statistics instead of global visual features. The reasoning behind this decision is that sorting by global visual characteristics often doesn’t find images that are similar at the scene level. For instance, a highway scene might be mistaken for a beach scene if road pixels are incorrectly classified as sand. Nonetheless, when given a reasonably accurate initial labeling, sorting by label statistics finds images that are more semantically related. This helps to eliminate outlier labels and find labels that are absent in a scene. For a given test image I, minimizing the energy function in equation 2 produces an initial labeling L of the superpixels in the image. If C is the total number of classes in the dataset, let T C be the set of unique labels which appear in L, i.e. T = t | s<sub>i</sub> : l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub> = t, where s<sub>i</sub> is a superpixel with index i in the test image, and l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub> is the label of s<sub>i</sub>. Semantic context is exploited in a probabilistic framework, where the conditional distribution P(c|T) is modeled over class labeling C given the initial global labeling of an image T. P(c|T) c C is computed in a K-nn fashion: P(c|T) = 1 + n(c, KT ) n(c, S) 1 + n(¬c, KT ) |S| (6) 5 where K<sub>T</sub> is the K-neighborhood of initial labeling T, n(c, X) is the number of superpixels with label c in X, n(¬c, X) is the number of superpixels with all labels except c in X, and |S| is the total number of superpixels in the training set. The likelihoods are normalized and a smoothing constant of value 1 is added. To obtain the neighborhood K<sub>T</sub>, training images are ranked by their distance to the query image. The distance between two images is determined by the weighted size of the intersection of their class labels, which intuitively shows that the neighbors of T are images that share many labels with those in T. A different weight is assigned to each class in T in a manner that gives preference to classes that are less represented. The algorithm operates in three stages, as depicted in Figure 3. It begins by (1) assigning a weight <sub>t</sub> to each class t T, which is inversely proportional to the number of superpixels in the test image with label t: <sub>t</sub> = 1 - n(t,I)/|I|, where n(t, I) is the number of superpixels in the test image with label l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub> = t, and |I| is the total number of superpixels in the image. Then, (2) training images are ranked by the weighted size of intersection of their class labels with the test image. Finally, (3) the global label likelihood L<sub>global</sub>(c) = P(c|T) of each label c C is computed using equation 6. Calculating the label costs is performed in real-time for a query image, without the need for any offline batch training. The method enhances the overall precision by utilizing solely the true labels of training images, without incorporating any global visual characteristics. 5.2 Inference with Label Costs Once the likelihoods L<sub>global</sub>(c) of each class c C are obtained, a label cost H(c) = -log(L<sub>global</sub>(c)) can be defined. The final energy function becomes: E(L) = X si∈S D(lsi = c|si) + λ X (i,j)∈A V (lsi, lsj) + X c∈C H(c)δ(c) (7) where (c) is the indicator function of label c: δ(c) = 1 if ∃si : lsi = c 0 otherwise (8) Equation 7 is solved using -expansion with the extension method to optimize label costs. Optimizing the energy function in equation 7 effectively minimizes the number of unique labels in a test image to those with low label costs, i.e., those most relevant to the scene. 6 Experiments The experiments were conducted on two extensive datasets: SIFTflow and LMSun. SIFTflow consists of 2,488 training images and 200 test images. All images are of outdoor scenes, sized 256x256 with 33 labels. LMSun includes both indoor and outdoor scenes, with a total of 45,676 training images and 500 test images. Image sizes range from 256x256 to 800x600 pixels with 232 labels. The same evaluation metrics and train/test splits as in previous methods are employed. The per-pixel accuracy (the percentage of pixels in test images that were correctly labeled) and per-class recognition rate (the average of per-pixel accuracies of all classes) are reported. The following variants of the system are evaluated: (i) baseline, as described in section 3, (ii) baseline (with balanced BDT), which is the baseline approach using a balanced classifier, (iii) baseline + FC (NL fusion), which is the baseline in addition to the fusing classifiers with normalized-likelihood (NL) weights in section 4, and (iv) full, which is baseline + fusing classifiers + global costs. To show the effectiveness of the fusion method (section 4.2), the results of (v) baseline + FC (average fusion), which is fusing classifiers by averaging their likelihoods, and (vi) baseline + FC (median fusion), which is fusing classifiers by taking the median of their likelihoods are reported. Results of (vii) full (without FV), which is the full system without using the Fisher Vector features are also reported. 6 x = 5 is fixed (section 4.1), a value that was obtained through empirical evaluation on a small subset of the training set. 6.1 Results The results are compared with state-of-the-art methods on SIFTflow in Table 1. K = 64 top-ranked training images have been set for computing the global context likelihoods (section 5.1). The full system achieves 81.7 Table 1: Comparison with state-of-the-art per-pixel and per-class accuracies (%) on the SIFTflow dataset.

LMSun is more challenging than SIFTflow in terms of the number of images, the number of classes, and the presence of both indoor and outdoor scenes. Accordingly, a larger value of K = 200 in equation 6 is used. The method achieves near-record performance in per-pixel accuracy (61.2 Table 2: Comparison with state-of-the-art per-pixel and per-class accuracies (%) on the LMSun dataset.

Figure 4 shows the per-pixel accuracy (on the y-axis) and the per-class accuracy (on the x-axis) as a function of T for a variety of K’s. Increasing the value of T generally produces better classification models that better describe the training data. At T 400, performance levels off. As shown, the global label costs consistently improve the performance over the baseline method with no global context. Using more training images (higher K) improves the performance through considering more semantically relevant scene images. However, performance starts to decrease for very high values of K (e.g., K = 1000) as more noisy images start to be added. 7 Figure 5 shows the per-class recognition rate for the baseline, combined classifiers, and the full system on SIFTflow. The fusing classifiers technique produces more balanced likelihood scores that cover a wider range of classes. The semantic context step removes outlier labels and recovers missing labels, which improves the recognition rates of both common and rare classes. Recovered classes include field, grass, bridge, and sign. Failure cases include extremely rare classes, e.g. cow, bird, desert, and moon. 6.2 Running Time The runtime performance was analyzed for both SIFTflow and LMSun (without feature extraction) on a four-core 2.84GHz CPU with 32GB of RAM without code optimization. For the SIFTflow dataset, training the classifier takes an average of 15 minutes per class. The training process is run in parallel. The training time highly depends on the feature dimensionality. At test time, superpixel classification is efficient, with an average of 1 second per image. Computing global label costs takes 3 seconds. Finally, MRF inference takes less than one second. MRF inference is run twice for the full pipeline. LMSun is much larger than SIFTflow. It takes 3 hours for training the classifier, less than a minute for superpixel classification per image, less than 1 minute for MRF inference, and 2 minutes for global label cost computation. 6.3 Discussion The presented scene parsing method is generally scalable as it does not require any offline training in a batch fashion. However, the time required for training a BDT classifier increases linearly with increasing the number of data points. This is challenging with large datasets like LMSun. Randomly subsampling the dataset has a negative impact on the overall precision of the classification results. Alternative approaches of mining discriminative data points that better describe each class are planned to be investigated. The system still faces challenges in trying to recognize very less-represented classes in the dataset (e.g., bird, cow, and moon). This could be handled via better contextual models per query image. 7 Conclusion A novel scene parsing algorithm has been presented that enhances the overall labeling precision, without neglecting foreground classes that are significant to human viewers. By merging likelihood scores from various classification models, the strengths of individual models have been successfully amplified, thus enhancing both the per-pixel and per-class accuracy. To prevent the removal of accurate labels through image retrieval, global context has been integrated into the parsing process using a probabilistic framework. The energy function has been expanded to incorporate global label costs that produce a more semantically relevant parsing output. Experiments have demonstrated the superior performance of the system on the SIFTflow dataset and comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on the LMSun dataset. 8",0,,,,
P026.pdf,"Exploring Bioacoustic Soundscapes with Generative Adversarial Networks: Investigating Novel Audio Stimuli for Enhanced Engagement Abstract This study explores the unconventional application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in translating whale song into hypnotic trance music, with the ultimate goal of enhancing human creativity through a psychoacoustic approach. By leveraging the unique acoustic properties of whale vocalizations, we aim to create a novel framework for music generation that not only replicates the mesmerizing qualities of whale songs but also induces a state of deep relaxation and heightened imagination in human listeners. Our research reveals that the incorporation of whale song patterns into trance music can lead to unexpected outcomes, including improved focus, enhanced problem-solving skills, and even purported instances of telepathic communication among participants. Furthermore, we discovered that the most effective GAN architectures for this task are those that incorporate elements of chaos theory and fractal geometry, allowing for the creation of intricate, self-similar patterns that resonate with the human brain’s innate propensity for recognizing and responding to natural harmonics. Interestingly, our experiments also showed that the generated music can have a profound impact on plant growth, with subjects exposed to the hypnotic trance music exhibiting a significant increase in photosynthetic activity and floral bloom intensity. While the underlying mechanisms behind these phenomena are not yet fully understood, our findings suggest that the application of GANs to whale song translation may have far-reaching implications for fields beyond music and psychoacoustics, including biology, ecology, and even paranormal research. 1 Introduction The realm of psychoacoustics has long been fascinated by the intricate patterns and melodies found in whale songs, with many researchers hypothesizing that these vocalizations hold the key to unlocking new avenues of human creativity. Recent advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have enabled the development of novel machine learning architectures capable of translating these complex acoustic patterns into hypnotic trance music. This innovative approach not only pushes the boundaries of audio synthesis but also raises fundamental questions about the cognitive and emotional responses of humans to such translated music. By leveraging the psychoacoustic properties of whale songs, it is possible to create trance-inducing soundscapes that can purportedly enhance human creativity, improve focus, and even facilitate access to previously unexplored states of consciousness. One of the more unconventional approaches to this line of research involves the use of whale song translations as a form of sonic catalyst for inducing lucid dreaming. Proponents of this method claim that the exposure to hypnotic trance music generated from whale songs can increase the likelihood of entering a lucid dream state, thereby allowing individuals to tap into the vast, uncharted territories of their subconscious mind. While this notion may seem far-fetched, preliminary results suggest that the unique acoustic features of whale songs, such as their low-frequency rumbles and high-pitched clicks, can indeed have a profound impact on the human brain’s ability to access and navigate the realm of the subconscious. Furthermore, researchers have also begun to explore the potential applications of whale song-based trance music in the context of cognitive enhancement and mental wellness. It is purported that the listening to such music can reduce stress levels, improve mood, and even enhance cognitive function in individuals with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although these claims are largely anecdotal and in need of rigorous scientific validation, they nonetheless highlight the vast, unexplored potential of whale song-based music therapy and its possible applications in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and education. In a somewhat bizarre twist, some researchers have also started investigating the potential for whale song translations to be used as a form of interspecies communication. The idea is that by generating hypnotic trance music from whale songs, humans may be able to establish a deeper, more empathetic connection with these marine mammals, potentially even facilitating a form of cross-species creative collaboration. While this concept may seem like the stuff of science fiction, it is nonetheless an intriguing area of study that challenges our current understanding of the boundaries between human and animal creativity. As such, it is an area that warrants further exploration and research, particularly in the context of developing more sophisticated and humane approaches to animal-human interaction. The development of GANs capable of translating whale songs into hypnotic trance music has also led to a number of unexpected discoveries, including the finding that certain types of whale songs appear to be more conducive to inducing creative states in humans than others. For example, the songs of the humpback whale, with their complex, hierarchical structures and hauntingly beautiful melodies, seem to be particularly well-suited for generating trance-inducing music that can facilitate deep states of relaxation and creativity. In contrast, the songs of the sperm whale, with their low-frequency clicks and whistles, appear to be more effective at inducing states of high focus and concentration, making them potentially useful for applications such as cognitive enhancement and mental performance optimization. These findings, while preliminary and in need of further validation, highlight the vast, unexplored potential of whale song-based music therapy and its possible applications in a wide range of fields, from psychology and neuroscience to education and the arts. 2 Related Work Recent advancements in generative modeling have paved the way for innovative applications of artificial intelligence in audio processing, including the translation of non-human sounds into music. The concept of using whale songs as a foundation for hypnotic trance music is rooted in the idea that the psychoacoustic properties of these sounds can have a profound impact on human cognition and creativity. Research has shown that the frequency range and rhythmic patterns present in whale songs can induce a state of deep relaxation and heightened focus, making them an ideal candidate for translation into hypnotic trance music. One approach to achieving this translation involves the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which have been successfully employed in various audio processing tasks, including music generation and style transfer. By training a GAN on a dataset of whale songs and hypnotic trance music, it is possible to learn a mapping between the two domains, allowing for the generation of novel trance music tracks that capture the essence of the original whale songs. However, this approach is not without its challenges, as the complexity and nuance of whale songs can make it difficult to preserve their psychoacoustic properties during the translation process. Interestingly, some researchers have explored the use of unconventional techniques, such as analyzing the brain waves of individuals listening to whale songs and using this data to inform the generation of hypnotic trance music. This approach, known as ""neurosonic resonance,"" involves measuring the neural activity of listeners and using this information to create music that is tailored to their specific brain wave patterns. While this method may seem unorthodox, it has been shown to produce remarkable results, with listeners reporting heightened states of relaxation and focus when exposed to music generated using this technique. In another unexpected twist, some studies have investigated the use of whale songs as a form of ""sonic fertilizer"" to enhance the creativity of plants. By playing whale songs to plants during their growth cycle, researchers have observed significant increases in plant growth and productivity, suggesting that the psychoacoustic properties of these sounds may have a profound impact on the natural world. While this finding may seem unrelated to the task of translating whale songs into hypnotic trance 2 music, it highlights the vast and unexplored potential of non-human sounds to influence human cognition and creativity. Furthermore, the use of GANs in audio processing has also been explored in the context of ""audio hallucinations,"" where the network is trained to generate sounds that are not present in the original audio signal. This approach has been used to create novel and eerie soundscapes that blur the line between reality and fantasy, raising important questions about the nature of sound and perception. By applying this technique to the translation of whale songs into hypnotic trance music, it may be possible to create sounds that are not only mesmerizing but also challenge our fundamental understanding of the audio world. In addition to these approaches, researchers have also explored the use of whale songs as a form of ""acoustic archaeology,"" where the sounds are used to uncover hidden patterns and structures in the natural world. By analyzing the frequency content and rhythmic patterns present in whale songs, scientists have been able to identify previously unknown patterns and relationships in the ocean’s ecosystem, highlighting the vast and unexplored potential of non-human sounds to inform our understanding of the world. While this application may seem far removed from the task of translating whale songs into hypnotic trance music, it underscores the profound impact that these sounds can have on our perception and understanding of reality. 3 Methodology To develop an effective framework for translating whale song into hypnotic trance music, we employed a multi-stage methodology that integrated psychoacoustic analysis, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture, and an innovative approach to auditory entrainment. Initially, we collected a comprehensive dataset of whale songs from various species, which were then subjected to a rigorous process of spectral analysis to identify the underlying patterns and frequencies that contribute to their hypnotic properties. This involved decomposing the whale songs into their constituent components, including low-frequency rumbles, mid-frequency moans, and high-frequency clicks, to create a spectral fingerprint for each species. The psychoacoustic analysis revealed that the hypnotic effects of whale songs can be attributed to the presence of specific frequency ranges, particularly in the delta and theta frequency bands, which are known to induce states of deep relaxation and heightened creativity. To replicate these effects in hypnotic trance music, we designed a custom GAN architecture that incorporated a generator network trained on a dataset of trance music tracks, and a discriminator network trained on a dataset of whale songs. The generator network was tasked with producing musical compositions that mimicked the spectral properties of whale songs, while the discriminator network evaluated the generated music based on its similarity to the original whale songs. In a bizarre twist, we discovered that the GAN architecture was capable of producing more convincing results when the training data was augmented with a dataset of ambient noises recorded from the vicinity of a haunted mansion. The exact mechanism behind this phenomenon is unclear, but it appears that the introduction of paranormal energy into the training process imbued the generated music with an otherworldly quality that was not only hypnotic but also seemingly prophetic. To further enhance the creative potential of the generated music, we incorporated an innovative approach to auditory entrainment, which involved embedding subtle patterns of binaural beats and isochronic tones into the musical compositions. These patterns were designed to stimulate specific regions of the brain associated with creativity, intuition, and higher states of consciousness. The GAN architecture was also modified to incorporate a feedback loop that allowed the generator network to adapt to the listener’s brainwave activity in real-time, using a non-invasive brain-computer interface to monitor the listener’s neural responses to the music. This feedback loop enabled the generator network to fine-tune the musical compositions to induce optimal states of relaxation, focus, and creativity, effectively creating a personalized hypnotic trance music experience for each listener. While the results of this approach were undeniably impressive, they also raised important questions about the potential risks and benefits of using GANs to manipulate human brainwave activity, and the need for further research into the ethical implications of this technology. 3 4 Experiments To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed GAN architecture in translating whale song into hypnotic trance music, we conducted a series of experiments involving a diverse range of participants, including professional musicians, music therapists, and individuals with no prior musical experience. The experiments were designed to assess the impact of the generated music on human creativity, with a particular focus on the psychoacoustic properties of the translated songs. We began by collecting a dataset of whale songs from various species, including humpback, orca, and sperm whales, which were then used to train our GAN model. The model consisted of a generator network that took the whale song as input and produced a corresponding hypnotic trance music track, and a discriminator network that evaluated the generated track and provided feedback to the generator. We trained the model using a combination of adversarial loss and a novel ""trance-inducing"" loss function, which was designed to maximize the hypnotic potential of the generated music. In addition to the standard metrics used to evaluate GAN performance, such as inception score and Fréchet inception distance, we also used a custom ""trance-meter"" device to measure the hypnotic effect of the generated music on human subjects. The trance-meter consisted of a wearable device that tracked the subject’s brain activity, heart rate, and skin conductivity while listening to the music, and provided a quantitative score of the subject’s level of trance. One of the most surprising results of our experiments was the discovery that the generated music had a profound effect on the creativity of participants who were given a task to create a piece of artwork while listening to the music. Specifically, we found that participants who listened to the music generated by our GAN model produced artwork that was significantly more surreal and abstract than those who listened to a control track of white noise. Furthermore, when we asked participants to describe their creative process, many reported experiencing vivid dreams and visions while listening to the music, which they claimed inspired their artwork. In an attempt to further understand the relationship between the generated music and human creativity, we conducted a series of experiments involving the use of psychedelic substances, including LSD and psilocybin. We found that participants who were under the influence of these substances and listened to the generated music produced artwork that was even more surreal and abstract than those who were not under the influence. However, when we tried to replicate these results using a control group of participants who were given a placebo, we found that the placebo group actually produced artwork that was more creative and innovative than the group that was under the influence of the psychedelic substances. This unexpected result led us to conclude that the generated music may have a synergistic effect with the psychedelic substances, and that the placebo effect may be a more significant factor in enhancing human creativity than previously thought. To further explore the properties of the generated music, we created a table to compare the trance- inducing scores of different whale species and their corresponding translated music tracks. Table 1: Trance-inducing scores of different whale species and their corresponding translated music tracks Whale Species Trance-inducing Score Music Track Length Surrealism Score Humpback Whale 0.85 10:45 0.92 Orca Whale 0.78 8:21 0.85 Sperm Whale 0.92 12:10 0.95 The results of our experiments demonstrate the potential of our proposed GAN architecture in generating hypnotic trance music that can have a profound impact on human creativity. However, the unexpected results of our experiments also highlight the need for further research into the relationship between the generated music, psychedelic substances, and the human creative process. Future studies should aim to replicate our results and explore the potential applications of our GAN model in fields such as music therapy, art therapy, and cognitive psychology. 4 5 Results Our experiments yielded a plethora of intriguing results, with the GAN-based model demonstrating a remarkable ability to translate whale song into hypnotic trance music that resonated with human listeners on a profound level. The psychoacoustic properties of the generated music were found to have a significant impact on the creative output of human subjects, with many reporting enhanced imagination and innovative thinking after exposure to the translated whale songs. One of the most unexpected findings was the discovery that the model’s performance was significantly improved when the training data was supplemented with recordings of dolphin clicks and elephant rumblings. This seemingly bizarre approach resulted in a 37 The results of our experiments are summarized in the following table: Table 2: Effect of supplemental training data on model performance Training Data Hypnotic Score Creative Output Nuance Capture Whale Song Only 0.62 0.45 0.31 Whale Song + Dolphin Clicks 0.81 0.63 0.51 Whale Song + Elephant Rummings 0.75 0.59 0.42 Whale Song + Dolphin Clicks + Elephant Rummings 0.92 0.81 0.67 In addition to the quantitative results, our study also uncovered some fascinating qualitative insights. Many human subjects reported experiencing vivid, ocean-themed dreams after listening to the generated music, with some even claiming to have gained a deeper understanding of the emotional lives of whales. While these findings are admittedly anecdotal, they do suggest that the model’s output is having a profound impact on human consciousness, one that extends far beyond the realm of mere entertainment. One potential explanation for these results is that the model is somehow tapping into the collective unconscious, leveraging the primal, emotional resonance of whale song to access deep-seated creative potential within the human psyche. This idea is supported by the fact that many of the generated music pieces exhibit a strange, otherworldly quality, as if they are emanating from a realm beyond the boundaries of human experience. While this hypothesis is certainly speculative, it does highlight the vast, uncharted territories that await exploration at the intersection of artificial intelligence, psychoacoustics, and human creativity. In a surprising turn of events, our research team also discovered that the model’s performance was influenced by the phase of the moon, with the generated music exhibiting a more ""lunar"" quality during full moon periods. This finding has led us to speculate about the potential role of celestial bodies in shaping the creative output of GANs, and has prompted us to embark on a new line of research exploring the relationship between artificial intelligence, astrology, and the human imagination. While this tangent may seem unrelated to the original research question, it does underscore the complex, multifaceted nature of creativity, and the many mysteries that remain to be unraveled in this fascinating field. 6 Conclusion In conclusion, our research has demonstrated the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in translating whale song into hypnotic trance music, with the ultimate goal of improving human creativity. The psychoacoustic approach employed in this study has yielded intriguing results, highlighting the complex relationships between auditory perception, emotional response, and creative cognition. Notably, the incorporation of whale song as a stimulus has led to the development of novel trance music patterns that defy conventional music theory, sparking debates about the role of unconventional sound sources in shaping human creativity. One unexpected finding was the discovery that the generated trance music exhibited a peculiar resonance with the brain’s default mode network, which is typically associated with introspection and self-reflection. This resonance was found to induce a state of deep relaxation in listeners, often accompanied by vivid visualizations and enhanced imagination. While the underlying mechanisms are 5 not yet fully understood, this phenomenon has led us to propose the concept of ""sonic entrainment,"" where the rhythmic patterns and frequency modulations in the translated whale song somehow synchronize with the brain’s intrinsic oscillations, facilitating a heightened state of creative receptivity. Furthermore, our research has also explored the possibility of using the generated trance music as a catalyst for creative problem-solving. In a series of experiments, participants were asked to listen to the translated whale song while engaging in various creative tasks, such as painting, writing, or composing music. The results showed a significant increase in creative output and innovation, with many participants reporting a sense of increased inspiration and flow. However, a bizarre side effect was observed, where some participants began to incorporate whale-like vocalizations into their creative work, blurring the lines between human and animal expression. This unexpected tangent has raised questions about the potential for interspecies creative collaboration and the role of biomimicry in artistic expression. In addition, our study has touched upon the idea that the translated whale song may possess inherent therapeutic properties, capable of alleviating symptoms of anxiety and depression. While this claim may seem far-fetched, our preliminary findings suggest that the hypnotic trance music generated by the GANs can indeed have a profound impact on mental well-being, possibly due to its ability to modulate the brain’s stress response and promote relaxation. To further investigate this claim, we propose the development of a new field of research, dubbed ""cetacean sound therapy,"" which would explore the therapeutic potential of whale song and other marine animal vocalizations. In retrospect, our research has not only demonstrated the feasibility of using GANs to translate whale song into hypnotic trance music but has also opened up new avenues for interdisciplinary research, spanning psychoacoustics, creativity studies, and marine biology. As we continue to push the boundaries of this innovative approach, we may uncover even more surprising and counterintuitive results, challenging our understanding of the complex relationships between sound, creativity, and the human experience. Ultimately, the true potential of this research lies in its ability to inspire new forms of artistic expression, foster creative collaboration between humans and animals, and perhaps even unlock the secrets of the ocean’s most enigmatic creatures. 6",0,,,,
P027.pdf,"emoji2vec: Learning Emoji Representations from their Description Abstract Many current natural language processing applications for social media rely on representation learning and utilize pre-trained word embeddings. There currently exist several publicly-available, pre-trained sets of word embeddings, but they contain few or no emoji representations even as emoji usage in social media has increased. emoji2vec are pre-trained embeddings for all Unicode emojis which are learned from their description in the Unicode emoji standard. The resulting emoji embeddings can be readily used in downstream social natural language processing applications alongside word2vec. For the downstream task of sentiment analysis, emoji embeddings learned from short descriptions outperforms a skip-gram model trained on a large collection of tweets, while avoiding the need for contexts in which emojis need to appear frequently in order to estimate a representation. 1 Introduction First introduced in 1997, emojis, a standardized set of small pictorial glyphs depicting everything from smiling faces to international flags, have seen a drastic increase in usage in social media over the last decade. The Oxford Dictionary named 2015 the year of the emoji, citing an increase in usage of over 800% during the course of the year, and elected the ’Face with Tears of Joy’ emoji () as the Word of the Year. As of this writing, over 10% of Twitter posts and over 50% of text on Instagram contain one or more emojis. Due to their popularity and broad usage, they have been the subject of much formal and informal research in language and social communication, as well as in natural language processing (NLP). In the context of social sciences, research has focused on emoji usage as a means of expressing emotions on mobile platforms. Interestingly, although essentially thought of as means of expressing emotions, emojis have been adopted as tools to express relationally useful roles in conversation. Emojis are culturally and contextually bound, and are open to reinterpretation and misinterpretation. These findings have paved the way for many formal analyses of semantic characteristics of emojis. Concurrently we observe an increased interest in natural language processing on social media data. Many current NLP systems applied to social media rely on representation learning and word embeddings. Such systems often rely on pre-trained word embeddings that can for instance be obtained from word2vec or GloVe. Yet, neither resource contain a complete set of Unicode emoji representations, which suggests that many social NLP applications could be improved by the addition of robust emoji representations. Embeddings for emoji Unicode symbols are learned from their description in the Unicode emoji standard. The usefulness of emoji representations trained in this way is demonstrated by evaluating on a Twitter sentiment analysis task. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis by investigating emoji analogy examples and visualizing the emoji embedding space is provided. 2 Related Work There has been little work in distributional embeddings of emojis. The first research done in this direction was an informal blog post by the Instagram Data Team in 2015. They generated vector embeddings for emojis similar to skip-gram-based vectors by training on the entire corpus of Instagram posts. Their research gave valuable insight into the usage of emojis on Instagram, and showed that distributed representations can help understanding emoji semantics in everyday usage. The second contribution, closest to ours, trained emoji embeddings from a large Twitter dataset of over 100 million English tweets using the skip-gram method. These pre-trained emoji representations led to increased accuracy on a similarity task, and a meaningful clustering of the emoji embedding space. While this method is able to learn robust representations for frequently-used emojis, representations of less frequent emojis are estimated rather poorly or not available at all. In fact, only around 700 emojis can be found in this corpus, while there is support of over 1600 emojis in the Unicode standard. The approach differs in two important aspects. First, since the representation of emojis are estimated directly from their description, robust representations are obtained for all supported emoji symbols — even the long tail of infrequently used ones. Secondly, the method works with much less data. Instead of training on millions of tweets, the representations are trained on only a few thousand descriptions. Still, higher accuracy results are obtained on a Twitter sentiment analysis task. In addition, the work relates to building word representations for words and concepts based on their description in a dictionary. Similarly to their approach, representations are build for emojis based on their descriptions and keyword phrases. Some of the limitations are evident in the work who showed that different cultural phenomena and languages may co-opt conventional emoji sentiment. Since training is only on English-language definitions and ignore temporal definitions of emojis, the training method might not capture the full semantic characteristics of an emoji. 3 Methodology The method maps emoji symbols into the same space as the 300-dimensional Google News word2vec embeddings. Thus, the resulting emoji2vec embeddings can be used in addition to 300-dimensional word2vec embeddings in any application. To this end emojis, their name and their keyword phrases are crawled from the Unicode emoji list, resulting in 6088 descriptions of 1661 emoji symbols. 3.1 Model Emoji embeddings are trained using a simple method. For every training example consisting of an emoji and a sequence of words w1, ..., wN describing that emoji, we take the sum of the individual word vectors in the descriptive phrase as found in the Google News word2vec embeddings v = N X k=1 wk, (1) where wk is the word2vec vector for word wk if that vector exists (otherwise we drop the summand) and vj is the vector representation of the description. A trainable vector xi for every emoji in our training set is defined, and the probability of a match between the emoji representation xi and its description representation vj is modeled using the sigmoid of the dot product of the two representations σ(xT i vj). For training we use the logistic loss L(i, j, yij) = −log(σ(yijxT i vj −(1 −yij)xT i vj)) (2) where yij is 1 if description j is valid for emoji i and 0 otherwise. 3.2 Optimization The model is implemented in TensorFlow and optimized using stochastic gradient descent with Adam as optimizer. As we do not observe any negative training examples (invalid descriptions of emojis do 2 not appear in the original training set), to increase generalization performance we randomly sample descriptions for emojis as negative instances (i.e. induce a mismatched description). One of the parameters of our model is the ratio of negative samples to positive samples; we found that having one positive example per negative example produced the best results. We perform early-stopping on a held-out development set and found 80 epochs of training to give the best results. As we are only training on emoji descriptions and our method is simple and cheap, training takes less than 3 minutes on a 2013 MacBook Pro. 4 Experiments The approach is quantitatively evaluated on an intrinsic (emoji-description classification) and extrinsic (Twitter sentiment analysis) task. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis is given by visualizing the learned emoji embedding space and investigating emoji analogy examples. 4.1 Emoji-Description Classification To analyze how well the method models the distribution of correct emoji descriptions, a manually- labeled test set containing pairs of emojis and phrases, as well as a correspondence label was created. For instance, the test set includes the example: , ""crying"", True, as well as the example , ""fish"", False. σ(xT i vi) is calculated for each example in the test set, measuring the similarity between the emoji vector and the sum of word vectors in the phrase. When a classifier thresholds the above prediction at 0.5 to determine a positive or negative correlation, an accuracy of 85.5% is obtained for classifying whether an emoji-description pair is valid or not. By varying the threshold used for this classifier, a receiver operating characteristic curve with an area-under-the-curve of 0.933 is obtained, which demonstrates that high quality of the learned emoji representations. 4.2 Sentiment Analysis on Tweets As downstream task the accuracy of sentiment classification of tweets for various classifiers with three different sets of pre-trained word embeddings are compared: (1) the original Google News word2vec embeddings, (2) word2vec augmented with emoji embeddings trained by skip-gram model, and (3) word2vec augmented with emoji2vec trained from Unicode descriptions. A dataset is used which consists of over 67k English tweets labelled manually for positive, neutral, or negative sentiment. In both the training set and the test set, 46% of tweets are labeled neutral, 29% are labeled positive, and 25% are labeled negative. To compute the feature vectors for training, we summed the vectors corresponding to each word or emoji in the text of the Tweet. The goal of this simple sentiment analysis model is not to produce state-of-the-art results in sentiment analysis; it is simply to show that including emojis adds discriminating information to a model, which could potentially be exploited in more advanced social NLP systems. Because the labels are rather evenly distributed, accuracy is an effective metric in determining performance on this classification task. Results are reported in Table 1. Augmenting word2vec with emoji embeddings improves overall classification accuracy on the full corpus, and substantially improves classification performance for tweets that contain emojis. It suggests that emoji embeddings could improve performance for other social NLP tasks as well. Furthermore, emoji2vec generally outperforms the emoji embeddings trained by the skip-gram model, despite being trained on much less data using a simple model. 4.3 Analogy Task A well-known property of word2vec is that embeddings trained with this method to some extent capture meaningful linear relationships between words directly in the vector space. For instance, it holds that the vector representation of ’king’ minus ’man’ plus ’woman’ is closest to ’queen’. Word embeddings have commonly been evaluated on such word analogy tasks. Unfortunately, it is difficult to build such an analogy task for emojis due to the small number and semantically distinct categories of emojis. Nevertheless, a few intuitive examples were collected. For every query the closest five 3 Table 1: Three-way classification accuracy on the Twitter sentiment analysis corpus using Random Forrests and Linear SVM classifier with different word embeddings.

Though the correct answer is sometimes not the top one, it is often contained in the top three. 5 Conclusion Since existing pre-trained word embeddings such as Google News word2vec embeddings or GloVe fail to provide emoji embeddings, emoji2vec — embeddings of 1661 emoji symbols were released. Instead of running word2vec’s skip-gram model on a large collection of emojis and their contexts appearing in tweets, emoji2vec is directly trained on Unicode descriptions of emojis. The resulting emoji embeddings can be used to augment any downstream task that currently uses word2vec embeddings, and might prove especially useful in social NLP tasks where emojis are used frequently (e.g. Twitter, Instagram, etc.). Despite the fact that the model is simpler and trained on much less data, it outperforms the skip-gram model on the task of Twitter sentiment analysis. As the approach directly works on Unicode descriptions, it is not restricted to emoji symbols. In the future the usefulness of the method for other Unicode symbol embeddings will be investigated. Furthermore, plans are made to improve emoji2vec in the future by also reading full text emoji descriptions and using a recurrent neural network instead of a bag-of-word-vectors approach for enocoding descriptions. In addition, since the approach does not capture the context-dependent definitions of emojis (such as sarcasm, or appropriation via other cultural phenomena), mechanisms will be explored to efficiently capturing these nuanced meanings. 4 6 Data Release and Reproducibility Pre-trained emoji2vec embeddings as well as the training data and code are released at https: //github.com/uclmr/emoji2vec. Note that the emoji2vec format is compatible with word2vec and can be loaded into gensim or similar libraries. 5",0,,,,
P028.pdf,"Do You See What I Mean? Visual Resolution of Linguistic Ambiguities Abstract Understanding language goes hand in hand with the ability to integrate com- plex contextual information obtained via perception. We present a novel task for grounded language understanding: disambiguating a sentence given a visual scene which depicts one of the possible interpretations of that sentence. To this end, we introduce a new multimodal corpus containing ambiguous sentences, representing a wide range of syntactic, semantic and discourse ambiguities, coupled with videos that visualize the different interpretations for each sentence. We address this task by extending a vision model which determines if a sentence is depicted by a video. We demonstrate how such a model can be adjusted to recognize different interpre- tations of the same underlying sentence, allowing to disambiguate sentences in a unified fashion across the different ambiguity types. 1 Introduction Ambiguity is one of the defining characteristics of human languages, and language understanding crucially relies on the ability to obtain unambiguous representations of linguistic content. While some ambiguities can be resolved using intra-linguistic contextual cues, the disambiguation of many linguistic constructions requires integration of world knowledge and perceptual information obtained from other modalities. We focus on the problem of grounding language in the visual modality, and introduce a novel task for language understanding which requires resolving linguistic ambiguities by utilizing the visual context in which the linguistic content is expressed. This type of inference is frequently called for in human communication that occurs in a visual environment, and is crucial for language acquisition, when much of the linguistic content refers to the visual surroundings of the child. Our task is also fundamental to the problem of grounding vision in language, by focusing on phenomena of linguistic ambiguity, which are prevalent in language, but typically overlooked when using language as a medium for expressing understanding of visual content. Due to such ambiguities, a superficially appropriate description of a visual scene may in fact not be sufficient for demonstrating a correct understanding of the relevant visual content. Our task addresses this issue by introducing a deep validation protocol for visual understanding, requiring not only providing a surface description of a visual activity but also demonstrating structural understanding at the levels of syntax, semantics and discourse. To enable the systematic study of visually grounded processing of ambiguous language, we create a new corpus, LAVA (Language and Vision Ambiguities). This corpus contains sentences with linguistic ambiguities that can only be resolved using external information. The sentences are paired with short videos that visualize different interpretations of each sentence. Our sentences encompass a wide range of syntactic, semantic and dis- course ambiguities, including ambiguous prepositional and verb phrase attachments, conjunctions, logical forms, anaphora and ellipsis. Overall, the corpus contains 237 sentences, with 2 to 3 interpretations per sentence, and an average of 3.37 videos that depict visual variations of each sentence interpretation, corresponding to a total of 1679 videos. Using this corpus, we address the problem of selecting the interpretation of an ambiguous sentence that matches the content of a given video. Our approach for tackling this task extends the sentence tracker. The sentence tracker produces a score which determines if a sentence is depicted by a video. This earlier work had no concept of ambiguities; it assumed that every sentence had a single interpretation. We extend this approach to represent multiple interpretations of a sentence, enabling us to pick the interpretation that is most compatible with the video. 2 Related Work Previous language and vision studies focused on the development of multimodal word and sentence representations as well as methods for describing images and videos in natural language. While these studies handle important challenges in multimodal processing of language and vision, they do not provide explicit modeling of linguistic ambiguities. Previous work relating ambiguity in language to the visual modality addressed the problem of word sense disambiguation. However, this work is limited to context independent interpretation of individ- ual words, and does not consider structure-related ambiguities. Discourse ambiguities were previously studied in work on multimodal coreference resolution. Our work expands this line of research, and addresses further discourse ambiguities in the interpretation of ellipsis. More importantly, to the best of our knowledge our study is the first to present a systematic treatment of syntactic and semantic sentence level ambiguities in the context of language and vision. The interactions between linguistic and visual information in human sentence processing have been extensively studied in psycholinguistics and cognitive psychology. A considerable fraction of this work focused on the processing of ambiguous language, providing evidence for the importance of visual information for linguistic ambiguity resolution by humans. Such information is also vital during language acquisition, when much of the linguistic content perceived by the child refers to their immediate visual environment. Over time, children develop mechanisms for grounded disambiguation of language, manifested among others by the usage of iconic gestures when communicating ambigu- ous linguistic content. Our study leverages such insights to develop a complementary framework that enables addressing the challenge of visually grounded disambiguation of language in the realm of artificial intelligence. 3 Task We provide a concrete framework for the study of language understanding with visual context by introducing the task of grounded language disambiguation. This task requires to choose the correct linguistic representation of a sentence given a visual context depicted in a video. Specifically, provided with a sentence, n candidate interpretations of that sentence and a video that depicts the content of the sentence, one needs to choose the interpretation that corresponds to the content of the video. To illustrate this task, consider the example, where we are given the sentence “Sam approached the chair with a bag” along with two different linguistic interpretations. In the first in- terpretation, which corresponds to parse 1(a), Sam has the bag. In the second interpretation associated with parse 1(b), the bag is on the chair rather than with Sam. Given the visual context from figure 1(c), the task is to choose which interpretation is most appropriate for the sentence. 4 Approach Overview To address the grounded language disambiguation task, we use a compositional approach for determin- ing if a specific interpretation of a sentence is depicted by a video. a sentence and an accompanying interpretation encoded in first order logic, give rise to a grounded model that matches a video against the provided sentence interpretation. The model is comprised of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) which encode the semantics of words, and trackers which locate objects in video frames. To represent an interpretation of a sentence, word models are combined with trackers through a cross-product which respects the semantic representation of the sentence to create a single model which recognizes that interpretation. 2 Given a sentence, we construct an HMM based representation for each interpretation of that sentence. We then detect candidate locations for objects in every frame of the video. Together the re- forestation for the sentence and the candidate object locations are combined to form a model which can determine if a given interpretation is depicted by the video. We test each interpretation and report the interpretation with highest likelihood. 5 Corpus To enable a systematic study of linguistic ambiguities that are grounded in vision, we compiled a corpus with ambiguous sentences describing visual actions. The sentences are formulated such that the correct linguistic interpretation of each sentence can only be determined using external, non-linguistic, information about the depicted activity. For example, in the sentence “Bill held the green chair and bag”, the correct scope of “green” can only be determined by integrating additional information about the color of the bag. This information is provided in the accompanying videos, which visualize the possible interpretations of each sentence. Figure 2 presents the syntactic parses for this example along with frames from the respective videos. Although our videos contain visual uncertainty, they are not ambiguous with respect to the linguistic interpretation they are presenting, and hence a video always corresponds to a single candidate representation of a sentence. The corpus covers a wide range of well known syntactic, semantic and discourse ambiguity classes. While the ambiguities are associated with various types, different sentence interpretations always represent distinct sentence meanings, and are hence encoded semantically using first order logic. For syntactic and discourse ambiguities we also provide an additional, ambiguity type specific encoding as described below. • Syntax Syntactic ambiguities include Prepositional Phrase (PP) attachments, Verb Phrase (VP) attachments, and ambiguities in the interpretation of conjunctions. In addition to logical forms, sentences with syntactic ambiguities are also accompanied with Context Free Grammar (CFG) parses of the candidate interpretations, generated from a deterministic CFG parser. • Semantics The corpus addresses several classes of semantic quantification ambiguities, in which a syntactically unambiguous sentence may correspond to different logical forms. For each such sentence we provide the respective logical forms. • Discourse The corpus contains two types of discourse ambiguities, Pronoun Anaphora and Ellipsis, offering examples comprising two sentences. In anaphora ambiguity cases, an ambiguous pronoun in the second sentence is given its candidate antecedents in the first sentence, as well as a corresponding logical form for the meaning of the second sentence. In ellipsis cases, a part of the second sentence, which can constitute either the subject and the verb, or the verb and the object, is omitted. We provide both interpretations of the omission in the form of a single unambiguous sentence, and its logical form, which combines the meanings of the first and the second sentences. Table 2 lists examples of the different ambiguity classes, along with the candidate interpretations of each example. The corpus is generated using Part of Speech (POS) tag sequence templates. For each template, the POS tags are replaced with lexical items from the corpus lexicon, described in table 3, using all the visually applicable assignments. This generation process yields an overall of 237 sentences, of which 213 sentences have 2 candidate interpretations, and 24 sentences have 3 interpretations. Table 1 presents the corpus templates for each ambiguity class, along with the number of sentences generated from each template. The corpus videos are filmed in an indoor environment containing background objects and pedestrians. To account for the manner of performing actions, videos are shot twice with different actors. Whenever applicable, we also filmed the actions from two different directions (e.g. approach from the left, and approach from the right). Finally, all videos were shot with two cameras from two different view points. Taking these variations into account, the resulting video corpus contains 7.1 videos per sentence and 3.37 videos per sentence interpretation, corresponding to a total of 1679 videos. 3 Table 1: POS templates for generating the sentences in our corpus. The rightmost column represents the number of sentences in each category. The sentences are produced by replacing the POS tags with all the visually applicable assignments of lexical items from the corpus lexicon shown in table 3.

A custom corpus is required for this task because no existing corpus, containing either videos or images, systematically covers multimodal ambiguities. Datasets aim to control for more aspects of the videos than just the main action being performed but they do not provide the range of ambiguities discussed here. The closest dataset is that of as it controls for object appearance, color, action, and direction of motion, making it more likely to be suitable for evaluating disambiguation tasks. Unfortunately, that dataset was designed to avoid ambiguities, and therefore is not suitable for evaluating the work described here. 6 Model To perform the disambiguation task, we extend the sentence recognition model which represents sentences as compositions of words. Given a sentence, its first order logic interpretation and a video, our model produces a score which determines if the sentence is depicted by the video. It simultaneously tracks the participants in the events described by the sentence while recognizing the events themselves. This al- lows it to be flexible in the presence of noise by integrating top-down information from the sentence with bottom-up information from object and property detectors. Each word in the query sentence is represented by an HMM, which recognizes tracks (i.e. paths of detections in a video for a specific object) that satisfy the semantics of the given word. In essence, this model can be described as having two layers, one in which object tracking occurs and one in which words observe tracks and filter tracks that do not satisfy the word constraints. Given a sentence interpretation, we construct a sentence-specific model which recognizes if a video depicts the sentence as follows. Each predicate in the first order logic formula has a corresponding HMM, which can recognize if that predicate is true of a video given its arguments. Each variable has a corresponding tracker which attempts to physically locate the bounding box corresponding to that variable in each frame of a video. This creates a bipartite graph: HMMs that represent predicates are connected to trackers that represent variables. The trackers themselves are similar to the HMMs, in that they comprise a lattice of potential bounding boxes in every frame. To construct a joint model for a sentence interpretation, we take the cross product of HMMs and trackers, taking only those cross products dictated by the structure of the formula corresponding to the desired interpretation. Given a video, we employ an object detector to generate candidate detections in each frame, construct trackers which select one of these detections in each frame, and finally construct the overall model from HMMs and trackers. 4 Table 2: An overview of the different ambiguity types, along with examples of ambiguous sentences with their linguistic and visual interpretations. Note that similarly to semantic ambiguities, syntactic and discourse ambiguities are also provided with first order logic formulas for the resulting sentence interpretations. Table 4 shows additional examples for each ambiguity type, with frames from sample videos corresponding to the different interpretations of each sentence.

Table 3: The lexicon used to instantiate the templates in table 1 in order to generate the corpus.

This is in essence the Viterbi algorithm, the MAP algorithm for HMMs, applied to finding optimal object detections jframe variable for each participant, and the optimal state kframe predicate for each predicate HMM, in every frame. Each detection is scored by its confidence from the object detector, f and each object track is scored by a motion coherence metric g which 5 determines if the motion of the track agrees with the underlying optical flow. Each predicate, max i1...iV k1...kP V X v=1 F(b1 i1v) + T X t=2 g(bt it−1 v , bt itv) ! + P X p=1 T X t=1 log hp(kt p, bθp(1) it θp(1), bθp(2) it θp(2)) + T X t=2 log ap(kt−1 p , kt p) ! (1) p, is scored by the probability of observing a particular detection in a given state hp, and by the probability of transitioning between states ap. The structure of the formula and the fact that multiple predicates often refer to the same variables is recorded by θ, a mapping between predicates and their arguments. The model computes the MAP estimate as: for sentences which have words that refer to at most two tracks (i.e. transitive verbs or binary predicates) but is trivially extended to arbitrary arities. Figure 3 provides a visual overview of the model as a cross-product of tracker models and word models. Our model extends the approach of in several ways. First, we depart from the dependency based representation used in that work, and recast the model to encode first order logic formulas. Note that some complex first order logic formulas cannot be directly encoded in the model and require additional inference steps. This extension enables us to represent ambiguities in which a given sentence has multiple logical interpretations for the same syntactic parse. Second, we introduce several model components which are not specific to disambiguation, but are required to encode linguistic constructions that are present in our corpus and could not be handled by the model of. These new components are the predicate “not equal”, disjunction, and conjunction. The key addition among these components is support for the new predicate “not equal”, which enforces that two tracks, i.e. objects, are distinct from each other. For example, in the sentence “Claire and Bill moved a chair” one would want to ensure that the two movers are distinct entities. In earlier work, this was not required because the sentences tested in that work were designed to distinguish objects based on constraints rather than identity. In other words, there might have been two different people but they were distinguished in the sentence by their actions or appearance. To faithfully recognize that two actors are moving the chair in the earlier example, we must ensure that they are disjoint from each other. In order to do this we create a new HMM for this predicate, which assigns low probability to tracks that heavily overlap, forcing the model to fit two different actors in the previous example. By combining the new first order logic based semantic representation in lieu of a syntactic representation with a more expressive model, we can encode the sentence interpretations required to perform the disambiguation task. Figure 3(left) shows an example of two different interpretations of the above discussed sentence “Claire and Bill moved a chair”. Object trackers, which correspond to variables in the first order logic representation of the sentence interpretation, are shown in red. Predicates which constrain the possible bindings of the trackers, corresponding to predicates in the representation of the sentence, are shown in blue. Links represent the argument structure of the first order logic formula, and determine the cross products that are taken between the predicate HMMs and tracker lattices in order to form the joint model which recognizes the entire interpretation in a video. The resulting model provides a single unified formalism for representing all the ambiguities in table 2. Moreover, this approach can be tuned to different levels of specificity. We can create models that are specific to one interpretation of a sentence or that are generic, and accept multiple interpretations by eliding constraints that are not com- mon between the different interpretations. This allows the model, like humans, to defer deciding on a particular interpretation or to infer that multiple interpretation of the sentence are plausible. 7 Experimental Results We tested the performance of the model described in the previous section on the LAVA dataset presented in section 5. Each video in the dataset was pre-processed with object detectors for humans, bags, chairs, and telescopes. We employed a mixture of CNN and DPM detectors, trained on held out sections of our corpus. For each object class we generated proposals from both the CNN and 6 the DPM detectors, and trained a scoring function to map both results into the same space. The scoring function consisted of a sigmoid over the confidence of the detectors trained on the same held out portion of the training set. As none of the disambiguation examples discussed here rely on the specific identity of the actors, we did not detect their identity. Instead, any sentence which contains names was automatically converted to one which contains arbitrary “person” labels. The sentences in our corpus have either two or three interpretations. Each interpretation has one or more associated videos where the scene was shot from a different angle, carried out either by different actors, with different objects, or in different directions of motion. For each sentence-video pair, we performed a 1-out-of-2 or 1-out-of-3 classification task to determine which of the interpretations of the corresponding sentence best fits that video. Overall chance performance on our dataset is 49.04%, slightly lower than 50% due to the 1out-of-3 classification examples. The model presented here achieved an accuracy of 75.36% over the entire corpus averaged across all error categories. This demonstrates that the model is largely capable of capturing the underlying task and that similar compositional crossmodal models may do the same. For each of the 3 major ambiguity classes we had an accuracy of 84.26% for syntactic ambiguities, 72.28% for semantic ambiguities, and 64.44% for discourse ambiguities. The most significant source of model failures are poor object detections. Objects are often rotated and presented at angles that are difficult to recognize. Certain object classes like the telescope are much more difficult to recognize due to their small size and the fact that hands tend to largely occlude them. This accounts for the degraded performance of the semantic ambiguities relative to the syntactic ambiguities, as many more semantic ambiguities involved the telescope. Object detector performance is similarly responsible for the lower performance of the discourse ambiguities which relied much more on the accuracy of the person detector as many sentences involve only people interacting with each other without any additional objects. This degrades performance by removing a helpful constraint for inference, according to which people tend to be close to the objects they are manipulating. In addition, these sentences introduced more visual uncertainty as they often involved three actors. The remaining errors are due to the event models. HMMs can fixate on short sequences of events which seem as if they are part of an action, but in fact are just noise or the prefix of another action. Ideally, one would want an event model which has a global view of the action, if an object went up from the beginning to the end of the video while a person was holding it, it’s likely that the object was being picked up. The event models used here cannot enforce this constraint, they merely assert that the object was moving up for some number of frames; an event which can happen due to noise in the object detectors. Enforcing such local constraints instead of the global constraint of the motion of the object over the video makes joint tracking and event recognition tractable in the framework presented here but can lead to errors. Finding models which strike a better balance between local information and global constraints while maintaining tractable inference remains an area of future work. 8 Conclusion We present a novel framework for studying ambiguous utterances expressed in a visual context. In particular, we formulate a new task for resolving structural ambiguities using visual signal. This is a fundamental task for humans, involving complex cognitive processing, and is a key challenge for language acquisition during childhood. We release a multimodal corpus that enables to address this task, as well as support further investigation of ambiguity related phenomena in visually grounded language processing. Finally, we present a unified approach for resolving ambiguous descriptions of videos, achieving good perfor- mance on our corpus. While our current investigation focuses on structural inference, we intend to extend this line of work to learning scenarios, in which the agent has to deduce the meaning of words and sentences from structurally ambiguous input. Furthermore, our framework can be beneficial for image and video retrieval applications in which the query is expressed in natural language. Given an ambiguous query, our approach will enable matching and clustering the retrieved results according to the different query interpretations. 7",0,,,,
P029.pdf,"OpenOmni: An Open-Source Multimodal Systems Abstract Multimodal conversational systems are increasingly sought after for their ability to facilitate natural and human-like interactions. However, comprehensive, col- laborative development and benchmarking solutions remain scarce. Proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini have showcased impressive integration of audio, visual, and textual data, achieving response times between 200-250 milliseconds. Nonetheless, challenges persist in managing the trade-offs between latency, pre- cision, financial cost, and data confidentiality. To address these complexities, we introduce OpenOmni, an open-source, end-to-end pipeline benchmarking platform. OpenOmni incorporates advanced technologies such as Speech-to-Text, Emotion Detection, Retrieval Augmented Generation, and Large Language Models, while also offering the capability to integrate custom models. It supports both local and cloud deployment, thereby guaranteeing data privacy and providing latency and accuracy benchmarking capabilities. This adaptable architecture allows researchers to tailor the pipeline to pinpoint performance bottlenecks and expedite the de- velopment of proof-of-concept solutions. OpenOmni holds significant potential to improve applications, including indoor assistance for individuals with visual impairments, thereby advancing human-computer interaction. 1 Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in interpreting user intent and adhering to instructions. However, text-based human-computer interaction (HCI) is often inadequate. The recent introduction of models that process audio, video, and text in real-time highlights the progress towards multimodal interaction. The impressive performance, characterized by response times of 200-250 milliseconds, makes these models suitable for large-scale applications. This marks a trend towards multimodal generative models and applications. One of the early publicly available solutions for multimodal large models that integrate text and images is available, but an open-source, end-to-end conversational agent implementation has not yet been made publicly accessible online. The preferred mode of multimodal HCI should replicate human interaction, incorporating visual and auditory inputs alongside audio outputs. Despite the existence of various modular components, a comprehensive, integrated, open-source implementation that fosters research and development in this domain is lacking. The integration of existing models, such as audio speech recognition (Speech2Text), multimodal large models (MLMs), and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), into a mul- timodal conversation framework reveals substantial difficulties in managing latency and ensuring accuracy. Traditionally, accuracy has posed a significant challenge. However, progress in large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced contextual relevance. The primary challenge now lies in minimizing end-to-end latency while maintaining high accuracy. Although it has been shown that this is feasible, the open-source community has not yet replicated these results. Data privacy is another concern. The closed-source nature of certain solutions raises issues related to cost and data confidentiality. Since these models are not open-source, users are required to upload their data to servers via paid APIs, leading to privacy concerns. The privacy policy indicates that various types of personal information are collected when users create accounts to access services, such as account details, user-generated content, communication data, and social media information. To facilitate the swift and responsible development of this new form of HCI, it is crucial to establish robust evaluation and benchmarking protocols. For instance, if a user initiates a conversation with a sad and urgent tone, the system should respond appropriately and with patience. Evaluating these interactions is both crucial and difficult for widespread adoption. This project aims to bridge these gaps by: • Creating an open-source framework to facilitate the development of customizable, end-to- end conversational agents. • Offering a fully local or controllable end-to-end multimodal conversation solution to address privacy concerns. • Establishing tools for annotating and benchmarking latency and accuracy, allowing for rapid proof-of-concept development and research. To accomplish this, we propose the OpenOmni framework, an open-source, end-to-end multimodal pipeline that integrates advanced technologies such as Speech-to-Text (Speech2Text), Emotion Detection, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Text-to- Speech (TTS). This framework collects video and audio data via cameras and microphones, processes the data through a customizable agent pipeline, and responds using a speaker. OpenOmni can be deployed on a local server, ensuring secure data management and addressing privacy concerns. For research purposes, OpenOmni includes tools for straightforward annotation and benchmarking, offering real-time monitoring and performance evaluation of latency. Users can annotate individ- ual components and entire conversations, generating comprehensive benchmark reports to identify bottlenecks. The open-source nature of OpenOmni allows for adaptation across various application domains, such as aged care and personal assistants. Each pipeline component can be enabled or disabled based on specific use cases, facilitating flexible and efficient deployment. Moreover, the framework supports the easy addition of new models, enabling comparisons and further experi- mentation. The OpenOmni framework allows researchers to focus on solving critical bottlenecks without reinventing the wheel, fostering innovation in multimodal conversational agents. It enables rapid proof-of-concept development, such as indoor conversational robots assisting visually impaired individuals. 2 Related Work Traditional end-to-end multimodal conversation systems typically employ a divide-and-conquer approach, separating the process into sub-tasks: speech-to-text (automatic speech recognition), image- to-text, text generation, and text-to-speech. Speech-to-text transforms spoken language into written text, while image-to-text produces textual descriptions of images. Text generation, often driven by large language models, generates contextually appropriate responses, and text-to-speech converts these responses back into spoken form. These core components constitute the fundamental structure of the conversational pipeline. The inclusion of image-to-text provides essential context, enhancing natural human-computer interaction, and additional functions like emotion detection adjust responses based on the user’s emotional state. An optional safeguard module can be integrated to guarantee that responses are suitable, non-harmful, and controlled, maintaining interaction integrity, particularly in delicate situations. Although this modular design enables the optimization of individual components, the cumulative latency and accuracy errors can make the complete system impractical for real-world use. While certain models are presented as fully end-to-end solutions, capable of handling video, audio, or text inputs and producing audio, image, or text outputs, their technical specifics remain undisclosed. It is postulated that audio and video frames are processed by modules that generate text, audio, and image outputs. Demonstrations suggest that these models possess memory capabilities, though the details and limitations are not fully understood. Whether the system can directly incorporate external private data is also unknown. Unlike the divide-and-conquer method, a fully end-to-end neural network can integrate more contex- tual information, such as tone, the presence of multiple speakers, and background noises, leading to more adaptable outputs. Theoretically, this method can decrease latency by removing orchestration bottlenecks. Nonetheless, both methods face substantial challenges because of the extensive data input and output, especially from video. The large size of video files puts a strain on servers and 2 models, raising computational costs and introducing latency from data transfer and model inference. Real-time conversation necessitates streaming processing, posing additional latency challenges. It was highlighted that a stable internet connection is needed to ensure smooth operation, underscoring these challenges. A technology company has introduced a planned open-source, fully end-to-end multimodal conver- sational AI, which supports text and audio modalities but excludes images. This model claims to achieve an end-to-end latency of 200 milliseconds. Integrating video modality through an Image2Text module into this model is possible, creating a hybrid solution that combines divide-and-conquer and fully end-to-end approaches. Another viable hybrid solution involves using speech-to-text to convert audio into text, then feeding this text along with video (processed into image sequences) to a vision language model, which generates text responses. These responses can subsequently be processed through text-to-speech. Multimodal end-to-end conversational agents show promise, yet large-scale implementation is challenging due to the need to balance latency, accuracy, and cost. Generating real-time responses within 200-400 milliseconds is difficult. The primary objective is to decrease latency and cost while enhancing accuracy, thereby improving the real-world applicability of conversational agents. 2.1 Evaluation Metrics To ensure productive and effective collaboration, it is crucial to have consistent and comparable evaluation metrics. For speech-to-text, the Word Error Rate (WER) is used to assess transcription accuracy, where a lower WER signifies better performance. Evaluating text-to-speech involves objective metrics like the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for naturalness and intelligibility, and the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for clarity, along with subjective human ratings. Text generation is the most difficult to evaluate, using metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR, which compare generated text to reference texts but may not completely capture the quality and relevance of responses. Assessing text generation often necessitates large-scale datasets, which are not always accessible. These metrics are widely adopted by the research community. Nevertheless, real-world applications require evaluation in production environments, taking into account various factors beyond these metrics. For instance, a conversational agent designed for aged care should steer clear of sensitive topics that may be specific to each individual. Subjective opinions differ by region, emphasizing the necessity for adaptable and innovative automatic or semi-automatic evaluation methods for conversational agents. 3 System Design 3.1 Requirement Analysis The system is designed to accept audio and video inputs and produce audio as output. Initially, two modules are required: one for gathering audio and video data from the microphone and camera, and another for emitting audio through a speaker. These Client modules must be compatible with a variety of devices, such as smartphones, laptops, or Raspberry Pi. The data collected will be transmitted to a server. The server, known as the API, should handle audio and video data along with associated metadata. It should have access to a storage layer that includes a relational database, file management, and a graph database for potential GraphRAG integration. Although the API can be located on the same device as the Client module, it is preferable to keep them separate for enhanced adaptability. This separation introduces the difficulty of transferring large volumes of data between modules. If the API is cloud-based, audio and video data must be uploaded to the cloud, for instance, using AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage. However, the upload process can introduce a bottleneck, making data transfer time-intensive. If the server is local, within the same network as the Client, transfer latency will be reduced. Nevertheless, this configuration necessitates running the large language model locally, which addresses data ownership and privacy issues but may increase model inference latency and reduce accuracy due to limited computational resources. Another approach is edge computing, where video data is pre-processed on edge devices and summarized for the API. Although this could be a research direction, data compression might result in information loss and decrease overall performance. 3 The pipeline components will require adjustments if developers intend to adopt the framework and integrate it with their work. To maintain flexibility, this part should be an independent module capable of running locally or in the cloud. Researchers and developers should be able to easily incorporate new components into this Agent module, further complicating the sharing of large datasets between modules. Finally, benchmarks are needed to comprehend the latency and accuracy performance of the entire pipeline. For tasks that are challenging to evaluate automatically, such as assessing the appropriateness of the LLM response, we propose and develop an annotation module to allow human annotators to easily evaluate results and generate benchmark reports. 3.2 System Architecture Based on these requirements, the system architecture was designed as depicted in Figure 1. The system is divided into five modules: Client, API, Storage, User Interface, and Agent, all primarily developed in Python. The Client module includes two submodules: the Listener for collecting video and audio data, and the Responder for playing audio. The Storage module consists of file storage for media, a relational database (PostgreSQL) for metadata, and a graph database (Neo4j) for potential GraphRAG integration. The API module, built with the Django framework, extends Django’s admin interface and permission control system to develop the benchmark and annotation interface. Django’s maturity and large support community make it ideal for production development. The Agent module, also in Python, includes all agent-related submodules, allowing deployment on suitable compute nodes without altering the architecture. Communication between the Client, API, and Agent modules will be via RESTful endpoints. For sharing large data between modules, local deployments (e.g., Client on Raspberry Pi, API and Agent on local servers) will use FTP for file synchronization. In cloud solutions (e.g., AWS), files will be uploaded to AWS S3, triggering a Lambda function to download files to an AWS Elastic File Storage (EFS) shared by the API and Agent modules. Docker and Docker Compose are used to manage all modules, allowing easy setup with a single docker compose up command. 4 Demonstration 4.1 Datasets Most multimodal question-answering datasets concentrate on multiple-choice questions rather than open-ended conversations. Some datasets involve multimodal conversations with images as additional input, but the output is often limited to multiple-choice or text. A significant challenge in developing multimodal conversational agents is the scarcity of suitable datasets. Although there is an abundance of data from human-human interactions or data extracted from movies and YouTube videos, efficient methods to organize this data into structured datasets are lacking. For specific domain applications, collecting data from human interactions and extracting datasets to train systems would be advantageous, enabling the agents to mimic human behavior. The OpenOmni Framework offers both capabilities: extracting conversational datasets from videos and testing them through the pipeline to assess agents’ responses, or gathering data from real-world scenarios to create datasets for further research. 4.2 Can ""AI"" be your president? One intensive conversational scenario is a debate. Segments were extracted from a US Presidential Debate, focusing on a candidate addressing the public and handling questions. After downloading the videos, a prepared script in our codebase can be used to split them into segments. This script allows for the specification of the start and end times of each conversation, enabling the creation of a conversational dataset from the videos. These segments were fed into our pipeline to evaluate its performance under different configurations: one using a commercial speech-to-text model, a vision model, and text-to-speech (Configuration A); a locally deployed quantization LLM with a speech-to-text model, text-to-speech, and our emotion detection model for video input (Configuration B); a version using a different LLM for inference (Configuration C); and a version using only a speech- to-text model, a language model, and text-to-speech, ignoring the video modality (Configuration D). The Agent modules were run on a specific GPU with 12GB memory. 4 The latency benchmark statistics are automatically generated. For example, Configuration A has an average latency of 45 seconds, with the vision model accounting for 31 seconds. The fastest configuration is Configuration D, averaging around 15 seconds, with most of the time consumed by the text-to-speech part, because the generated content is quite long and comprehensive. The slowest configuration is Configuration C, taking around 189 seconds, with the LLM model inference step taking the longest time. Configuration B takes an average of 60 seconds, with the LLM model inference averaging 28 seconds and our emotion detection model averaging around 10 seconds. Table 1: Accuracy: Overall Conversation Quality TRACK ID USER ID OVERALL COMMENT f1 1 As the question is quite subjective, the answer is good and in context f2 2 The answer is quite general, while the candidate is doing much better work with supported eviden f3 1 Failed to generate proper in-context response; the response is talking about how to respond, not ac f4 1 Generate some general comments without strong support evidence f5 1 General response, however, no good evidence to support. After annotation with our interface, accuracy statistics are automatically generated. The accuracy metrics here include evaluation metrics like WER, CER for the speech-to-text task, and overall scores given by the annotators. As shown in Table 1, the average score for each conversation is 2.4. Text-to-speech can be improved with more natural emotion or personality. The generated content is often too general and sometimes inappropriate. The candidate’s responses are more in-context and evidence-supported. The pipeline excelled only in answering a subjective question about the candidate’s age, where Configuration A performed well. Configuration D had the best overall accuracy, but its responses were often in-context yet pompous. Thus, the candidate still outperforms AI. In conclusion, ""AI cannot be the President of the US just yet, considering both latency and accuracy."" 4.3 Assist the Visually Impaired While latency and the need for external information currently prevent AI from undertaking mission- critical tasks, conversational agents can be production-ready and useful for non-latency-critical areas that do not require extensive external knowledge. Assisting indoor activities for the visually impaired is one such application, where high-speed internet can be utilized, or data transfer can be limited to local exchanges. These types of applications can benefit from maintaining high input/output rates, helping to mitigate latency issues. Questions were prepared for the visually impaired, including locating objects, navigating indoors, and inquiries about the surroundings. Six questions were sampled and fed to the Configuration A pipeline. One scenario demonstration is included in our provided video. In this scenario, video and audio data stream from the client side and are saved to storage along with exportable metadata accessible via the admin portal. This setup allows for the exportation of annotated datasets, including raw video and audio data, for developing new models. The latency statistics show responses within approximately 30 seconds. Annotated results show a 4.7/5 accuracy, but the agent lacks specific skills for assisting the visually impaired. For example, ideally, it should provide step-by-step instructions on grabbing a coffee cup rather than just a general description. This indicates that while conversational agents are nearly ready for assisting the visually impaired with indoor activities, improvements in latency and response quality are still needed. 5 Conclusion Multimodal conversational agents offer a more natural form of human-computer interaction, as demonstrated by models like GPT-4o. However, real-world constraints require a balance between cost, latency, and accuracy, which may explain why the full capabilities of such models are not yet accessible. Several technical options exist to achieve this balance, including traditional divide-and-conquer methods, fully end-to-end models, and hybrid approaches. The fully end-to-end approach inherently allows for lower latency, while the divide-and-conquer method faces latency issues when coordinating 5 multiple components. Both approaches must address the challenge of handling large data I/O. If models are deployed locally, local network I/O issues can be more manageable. However, some models are closed-source, making local deployment impractical. While deploying other vision models locally is feasible, achieving high accuracy may be limited by local computational resources. Hybrid solutions provide alternative approaches: pre-processing or compressing large data locally and then utilizing cloud-based models, or converting video to text and integrating it into the end-to-end voice model. We developed the OpenOmni framework to enable researchers to integrate their work into an end-to- end pipeline. The framework supports various solutions, allows for pipeline customization, generates latency performance reports, and provides an annotation interface for accuracy review. These features facilitate the creation of benchmark reports to identify and address key issues. Testing with the US Presidential debate scenario highlighted latency as a critical issue, particularly with large video data. Integrating external knowledge remains a challenge, emphasizing the need for efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). For applications like indoor assistance for the visually impaired, latency improvements and model adaptation are both essential. The OpenOmni framework can significantly benefit the research community by facilitating the collection and management of new datasets, integrating various conversational agents approaches, and generating automatic latency benchmarks. Its annotation interface aids in accuracy performance review, making OpenOmni production-ready for suitable application scenarios and fostering further development in multimodal conversational agents. 6",1,,,,
P030.pdf,"BladeDISC++: Enhancing Memory Usage Through Symbolic Shape Analysis Abstract The increasing prevalence of dynamic characteristics in modern deep learning tasks has led to the growing importance of dynamic shape compilers. These compilers are designed to create effective kernels for dynamic shape graphs, which have a stable structure but uncertain tensor shapes. However, memory optimization, which is vital in the era of large models, has not been thoroughly investigated for dynamic shape graphs. The core issue lies in the absence of specific tensor shapes, which are generally required by existing methods like operation scheduling and rematerializa- tion. To overcome this issue, we present operation scheduling and rematerialization strategies that utilize symbolic shapes, implemented in BladeDISC++. Furthermore, given that rematerialization decisions cannot be determined at compile time alone due to unknown tensor shapes, BladeDISC++ uses a hybrid approach combining compilation and runtime to address shape changes effectively. Our findings demon- strate that BladeDISC++ significantly reduces memory consumption for dynamic shape graphs, achieving levels similar to those of optimizations with precise shapes. This advancement facilitates the broader use of dynamic shape compilers. 1 Introduction Dynamic shape compilers are becoming more and more necessary due to their ability to optimize deep learning tasks that have dynamic attributes. While advancements in kernel generation have been made by systems like TorchInductor and Modular, memory optimization remains a less-explored area. Traditional methods like operation scheduling and rematerialization, which encompass recomputation and offloading, depend on precise tensor shapes to evaluate the memory impact of operations or subgraphs, and consequently make optimization choices during compilation. However, these methods become impractical when shape values are not available. BladeDISC++, which is based on the dynamic shape compiler BladeDISC, uses symbolic shapes to address these challenges. With symbolic shapes, BladeDISC++ is capable of comparing the memory effects of different operation sequences, and identifying the ideal scheduling order. For rematerialization, symbolic shapes are used to identify the optimal recomputation subgraph at compile time, and assist in making final rematerialization decisions during runtime. Our experiments reveal that BladeDISC++ can efficiently reduce memory usage during training with dynamic shape graphs when compared to BladeDISC. Furthermore, BladeDISC++ achieves memory consumption similar to static shape training while eliminating the overhead associated with recompilation and tensor padding. 2 Memory optimizations based on symbolic shapes As shown in Figure 1, BladeDISC++ starts with a dynamic shape computation graph, and proceeds by conducting a symbolic shape analysis to construct a global symbolic shape graph. This graph details the mathematical connections between the shape symbols, which will be discussed in section 2.1. Following this, the symbolic shape graph, along with the computation graph, is optimized through . steps that include operation fusion, operation scheduling, and rematerialization. These steps are aimed at memory usage reduction. As previous work on BladeDISC has addressed operation fusion, this paper focuses on operation scheduling, which will be discussed in section 2.2, and rematerialization, which will be discussed in section 2.3. Using the symbolic shape graph instead of exact tensor shapes, BladeDISC++ can still compare the memory usage of different operation sequences and determine the benefit of recomputation subgraphs. Moreover, because the memory needs of a dynamic shape graph can fluctuate between different runs, it is not practical to base rematerialization decisions, such as how much memory to free, solely on compile time. Consequently, BladeDISC++ investigates all possible rematerialization options, searches for the corresponding regeneration subgraphs, and makes final rematerialization decisions during runtime. [width=0.8]placeholder.png figureMemory optimizations based on symbolic shapes in BladeDISC++ 2.1 Symbolic shape graph analysis BladeDISC++ systematically analyzes and obtains shape information from the semantics of each operation within the dynamic shape computation graph. Following this, it establishes a global symbolic shape graph. This graph is designed to show the mathematical relationships between shape dimensions through shape value extraction and input-output shape inference. func . func @main (% arg0 : tensor <? ,[ @S0 ] > , % arg1 : tensor <12 x11008 >) { %1 = broadcast (% arg1 ) -> tensor <4096 x ? , [ @C4096 , @S0 ] > %2 = d yna mi c_r eshape (% arg0 , % new_shape ) -> tensor <? x12 ,[ @S1 , @C12 ] > // The last consumer of %2 %3 = dot (%2 , % arg1 ) -> tensor <? x11008 , [ @S1 , @C11008 ] > // The last consumer of %3 %4 = reduce (%3) -> tensor <? , [ @S1 ] > %1084 = broadcast (%4) -> tensor <11008 x ? , [ @C11008 , @S1 ] > %1085 = broadcast (% arg0 ) -> tensor <1024 x ? , [ @C1024 , @S0 ] > } func . func @ s y m b o l i c _ s h a p e _ g r a p h () { SymbolicDim @S0 SymbolicDim @S1 @S0 = Mul @C12 , @S1 } Listing 1: Example of a dynamic shape graph and its symbolic shape graph As shown in Listing 1, BladeDISC++ uses a SymbolicDim operation to represent a symbolic value. This value is linked to a dimension of a tensor shape in the dynamic shape graph as an attribute, for example, tensor<?x?, [@S0, @S1]>. The equation @S0 = 12 * @S1, for instance, is derived from a DynamicReshapeOp. It means the input and output tensors have an equivalent number of elements. The comparison of tensor memory sizes is vital for both operation scheduling and rematerialization. BladeDISC++ uses SymbolicExpr to show mathematical expressions of symbolic dimensions. This allows for comparisons using a best-effort approach. For example, the element count of tensors 2.2 Operation scheduling Operation scheduling aims to discover a memory-efficient sequence of operations from the initial computation graph. Existing scheduling algorithms typically traverse the graph and select an operation from a ReadySet, which includes operations whose predecessors have been scheduled, at each step. The selection is mainly based on a comparison of the memory impact of the different operations, which is determined by calculating the difference between the memory freed and the memory allocated after scheduling a particular operation. BladeDISC++ employs a similar strategy, emphasizing the calculation and comparison of memory impact among different operations when exact tensor shapes are unavailable in dynamic shape graphs. In BladeDISC++, the memory impact of each operation 2 is calculated using symbolic shapes, resulting in a SymbolicExpr. These SymbolicExprs are then compared using the symbolic shape graph. In Listing 1, the DynamicReshapeOp and DotOp are present in the ReadySet at a particular step. DotOp, being the last consumer of When comparing memory impact SymbolicExprs is not possible, we use a standard approach: selecting the operation that results in shorter overall tensor lifespans based on the graph’s structure. 2.3 Rematerialization Traditional rematerialization methods use algorithms to decide which tensors to release early to reduce memory pressure, and how to conduct the following regeneration via reloading or recomputation. These methods also search for optimal recomputation subgraphs, evaluating their memory effects. Tensor rematerialization can negatively impact end-to-end performance, so it should only be used when the graph’s execution could exceed memory limits. However, dynamic shape graphs, with uncertain tensor shapes, may show varied peak memory use between different runs. Some runs may not need rematerialization as they remain within memory limits, whereas others may. Therefore, it is impractical to make decisions solely at compilation time. Also, the absence of exact shapes presents challenges in evaluating the memory effects of potential recomputation subgraphs. To address these challenges, BladeDISC++ uses a combined compilation-runtime approach based on symbolic shapes to better manage shape variations during graph runs. At compile time, it explores all possible rematerialization candidates and identifies the regeneration subgraphs associated with them. These subgraphs are incorporated into the original computation graph as separate execution paths. Final choices regarding which tensor to release and the related regeneration method are made during runtime. During compilation, as shown in Figure 1, BladeDISC++ adds a Remat::EvictOp after each operation. This checks if active tensors at that point need to be released to lower memory pressure. Regeneration subgraphs, including reload and recomputation, are created for each potential tensor. While reloading only involves a host-to-device instruction and has no impact on memory, finding recomputation subgraphs needs thorough evaluation as poor choices can increase peak memory consumption. BladeDISC++ uses a standard search approach, but assesses the memory impact of subgraphs using SymbolicExpr. Taking the recomputation subgraph searching for Following this, BladeDISC++ inserts Remat::RegenerateOps, with corresponding regeneration sub- graphs for both reload and recompute. These are inserted before each potential tensor’s subsequent consumers. The Remat::RegenerateOp checks if a tensor has been released, and which regeneration method is being used. During runtime, BladeDISC++ monitors memory usage throughout kernel execution. Whenever an EvictOp is triggered, BladeDISC++ checks the present memory usage. When the memory limit is about to be exceeded, it performs a real-time analysis of all potential tensors offered by the EvictOp. Final decisions about which tensor needs to be released, and the regeneration method, are determined by taking memory savings and end-to-end performance into account, following a similar approach as detailed in. Subsequent Remat::RegenerateOps then check these choices to decide which regeneration subgraphs to trigger. 3 Evaluation For our evaluation, we performed experiments on the supervised fine-tuning of Llama-2-1b, which is a customized model from the official Llama-2-7b with only the number of hidden layers decreased from 32 to 4. This was done on an Alibaba Cloud instance, with 40GB of GPU RAM. We used the CodeAlpaca-20K dataset, which contains text samples with lengths from about 100 to 3000 characters. During each training cycle, a fixed amount of randomly selected samples are put into a batch. This leads to variations in batch shapes between cycles. To evaluate the effectiveness of BladeDISC++, we compared memory usage and end-to-end per- formance of dynamic shape training with BladeDISC++ against both dynamic and static shape 3 training with BladeDISC. For static shape training, following common methods, input sequences are padded to the closest power of 2 in length. This balances redundant computation and compilation overhead. Additionally, we set the largest bucket size to be equal to the longest sequence length in the dataset. This was done to investigate whether comparable memory optimization can be achieved using symbolic shapes instead of exact shapes. The experimental results show that BladeDISC++ is able to reduce peak memory consumption during dynamic shape training. BladeDISC++ also demonstrated memory consumption similar to static shape training, while improving end-to-end performance by eliminating the overheads of recompilation and input bucketing.

We have introduced operation scheduling and rematerialization strategies that use symbolic shapes, implemented in BladeDISC++. Evaluations demonstrate that BladeDISC++ effectively decreases memory usage for dynamic shape training and can match the memory optimization results of static shape training. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt in this area. We hope it will support the compiler community in handling dynamic shape tasks, and increase the use of dynamic shape compilers. 4",1,,,,
P031.pdf,"Explainable Identification of Hate Speech towards Islam using Graph Neural Networks Abstract Islamophobic language on online platforms fosters intolerance, making detection and elimination crucial for promoting harmony. Traditional hate speech detection models rely on NLP techniques like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and encoder-decoder models. However, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), with their ability to utilize relationships between data points, offer more effective detection and greater explainability. In this work, speeches are represented as nodes and connect them with edges based on their context and similarity to develop the graph. A novel paradigm using GNNs to identify and explain hate speech towards Islam is introduced. The model leverages GNNs to understand the context and patterns of hate speech by connecting texts via pretrained NLP-generated word embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance and enhancing detection accuracy while pro- viding valuable explanations. This highlights the potential of GNNs in combating online hate speech and fostering a safer, more inclusive online environment. 1 Introduction Detecting and eliminating hate speech on social media platforms is of utmost importance for the promotion of harmony and tranquility in society. The escalating presence of hate speech specifically targeting Islam or Muslim communities on online discussion platforms is a growing concern. This form of hate speech not only fosters an environment of intolerance and hostility but can also have severe psychological impacts on individuals and communities, leading to real-world violence and discrimination. To address this issue, researchers have increasingly turned to advanced technologies; using text- processing approaches in AI. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are frequently employed for hate speech detection, with some offering severity assessment of hate speech. These methods utilize sophisticated algorithms to analyse vast amounts of textual data, identifying patterns and features indicative of hate speech. For instance, deep learning models, like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can learn complex representations of text data, enabling them to detect subtle and context- dependent instances of hate speech. Modern NLP techniques, on the other hand, can enhance these models by providing richer linguistic insights. Tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition are just a few NLP techniques that help in breaking down and understanding the text’s structure and meaning. Moreover, the integration of latest NLP model and transformers, like BERT and GPT, has significantly improved the ability of models to understand context, sarcasm, and implicit hate speech, which are often challenging to detect. Another interesting approach is to use human-centric perspectives of AI using some benchmark dataset. Researchers have tried to employ GNNs in hate speech classification, but still needs more focus on this area. Despite their potential, GNNs have not been actively employed for the purpose of interpretable identification of hate speech, particularly in Islamic contexts. Islamophobic content often exhibits close word choices and hate speakers from the same community, which GNNs can leverage to reveal and explain patterns, alongside impressive classification scores. A novel approach employing graph neural networks for the identification and explication of hate speech directed at Islam (XG-HSI) is introduced. The dataset is pre-processed to focus on Islamic contexts, utilize pretrained NLP models for word embeddings, establish connections between texts, and employ a series of graph encoders for hate speech target identification, which achieves state-of- the-art performance. 2 Background Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful neural networks designed for processing non-Euclidean data organized in complex, interconnected graphs. Using their ability to utilize relations between different data points, GNNs have shown tremendous promise in text classification and detection tasks. GNNs have the ability to enhance hate speech detection on social media by modeling complex relationships between users and content, capturing contextual information from interactions. They propagate information across the network, identifying coordinated and evolving hate speech patterns. We also present a case study in Section 5 to illustrate how incorporating related information enhances the process. A general bag of words-based approach to create graphs, without LLMs is adopted. By integrating with pretrained NLP models, GNNs leverage contextual word embeddings to better understand the subtleties of hate speech. This combined approach improves the accuracy, context-awareness, and adaptability of detection systems, making them more effective in identifying hate speech directed at Islam and potentially generalizing to other targeted groups. 3 Methodology 3.1 Notations Let a graph G = (V, E, X), where V represents nodes, E denotes edges. We also define N and M as the numbers of nodes and edges, respectively. Each node v is associated with a feature xi ˘2208 RF , and the node feature matrix for the entire graph is denoted as X ˘2208 RN ˘00d7F , where F represents the feature vector length. In our approach, each content denotes a node, contextual similarity between two nodes is denoted by an edge and word embeddings are node features of the graph. The task involves a node classification task to detect hate speech and Islamophobic content. 3.2 Data Pre-Processing Initially, the dataset was filtered to focus on hate speech targeting Islam. Next, pretrained NLP models is applied to the text to obtain word embeddings X as node features for all nodes V. Edges E are determined using cosine similarity between embeddings with a threshold of 0.725. Subsequently, GNN is applied for the classification task. 3.3 Graph Encoder After data pre-processing, every data point x ˘2282 X undergoes a series of transformations to get output p. First, it is processed by a linear layer producing x1 (Equation 1). x1 = Wx + b (1) Subsequently, x1 is passed into two initial graph encoders to aggregate neighborhood information, feature extraction, and yield x2, x3 utilizing G and concatenated to x23 (Equation 2,3, 4). Here in Equation 2, we aggregate features from a node’s local neighborhood, to learn different characteristics. In Equation 3 and 4, we use a semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data, employing an efficient variant of convolutional neural networks that operate directly on graphs. x2 = W1x1 + W2 · meanj∈N(i)x1 (2) x3 = W1x1 + ˆAx1 (3) 2 x23 = concat(x2, x3) (4) Here, N is the set of neighbouring nodes. Following this, x23 is passed through another graph layer employing attention-based feature extraction, utilizing masked self-attentional layers to implicitly assign different weights to nodes in a neighbourhood, producing x4 (Equation 5 and 6). x4 = αi,iΘx23i + X j∈N(i) αi,jΘx23j (5) αi,j = exp(LeakyReLU(aT [Θx23i||Θx23j])) P k∈N(i) exp(LeakyReLU(aT [Θx23i||Θx23k])) (6) Here, ˘03b8 refers to trainable model weights. ˘03b1 is the attention value, calculated by the equation mentioned. Finally, x4 is passed through a final linear layer to obtain logits pl, which are then subjected to a softmax operation to derive probabilities p (Equation 7 amd 8). xc = concat(x1, x4); pl = Wxc + b (7) p = softmax(pl) (8) 3.4 Loss Function Cross Entropy loss is designed to minimize the difference between the predicted probabilities and true values, as follows: lce = − n X i=1 (pilog(o(pi)) + (1 −pi)log(1 −o(pi))) (9) 3.5 Graph Explanation GNNExplainer is used to derive explanations from the graph encoder network for interpreting the results and find underlying relations and causation. It works by taking a trained GNN model and its predictions as input, and returns explanations in the form of compact subgraph structures and subsets of influential node features. This model-agnostic approach can explain predictions of any GNN-based model on various graph-based machine learning tasks, including node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. GNNExplainer formulates explanations as rich subgraphs of the input graph, maximizing mutual information with the GNN’s predictions. It achieves this by employing a mean field variational approximation to learn real-valued graph masks that select important subgraphs and feature masks that highlight crucial node features. Through this process, GNNExplainer offers insights into the underlying reasoning of GNN predictions, enhancing model interpretability and facilitating error analysis. 4 Experiments 4.1 Experimental Setup Dataset. HateXplain, a benchmark hate speech dataset designed for addressing bias and interpretabil- ity is used. The dataset has hate speech targets labelled. This labelling is used to collect only Muslim-focused sentences and created a subset to work on this project. A 6:2:2 train, validation and test split is used. Baselines. The baseline models are: CNN-GRU, BiRNN, BiRNN-HateXplain, BERT, BERT- HateXplain. Mentioned HateXplain-based models are fine-tuned on HateXplain dataset. 3 Implementation Details. Hugging Face transformers library is used to get embeddings from pre- trained BERT (bert-base-uncased) and BiRNN. The model is trained for 200 epochs with a learning rate of 0.001, using Adam optimizer. The experimental results in Table 1 show that our model achieves remarkable performance comparing to benchmarks with explaining occurring phenomenons.We utilized a single layer for each type of GNN, with a maximum tokenization length of 512 in the tokenizer and length of BERT embeddings (F ) set to 128. 4.2 Experimental Results Table 1 shows the performance of various models in detecting hate speech, highlighting accuracy and Macro F1 metrics. Traditional models like CNN-GRU and BiRNN show lower performance, with BiRNN-HateXplain offering slight improvements. BERT-based models perform better, particularly BERT-HateXplain. However, our proposed models, XG-HSI-BiRNN and XG-HSI-BERT, signifi- cantly outperform all others, with XG-HSI-BERT achieving the highest accuracy (0.741) and Macro F1 (0.747). These results demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our dual GNN approach in hate speech detection. Table 1: Experimental Results (˘2191) Model Accuracy Macro F1 CNN-GRU 0.628 0.604 BiRNN 0.591 0.578 BiRNN-HateXplain 0.612 0.621 BERT 0.692 0.671 BERT-HateXplain 0.693 0.681 XG-HSI-BiRNN (Ours) 0.742 0.737 XG-HSI-BERT (Ours) 0.751 0.747 5 Graph Explanation Case Study For a given post, ""How is all that awesome Muslim diversity going for you native germans? You have allowed this yourselves. If you do not stand and fight against this. You get what you asked for what you deserve!"", the predicted classification was offensive towards Islam. As per the explainer, the neighbouring and self-tokens helped to classify this as offensive to Muslims are fight, Muslim diversity, brooks, rish, donald, syrian, schultz, typed. The text’s association of ""Muslim diversity"" with potential blame and its confrontational tone in phrases like ""stand and fight against this,"" combined with neighbouring tokens like syrians, brooks, syrians denoted negative sentiment. 6 Discussion This study not only addresses the immediate challenge of identifying and explaining hate speech directed at Islam but also recognizes the broader impact of hate speech propagation on online platforms. The proliferation of Islamophobic language fosters intolerance, division, and hostility within communities, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and prejudices. By leveraging GNNs in our XG-HSI framework, we not only detect hate speech but also provide explanations for its occurrence, shedding light on the underlying factors driving such behaviour. GNNs excel in capturing complex relationships and patterns within data, enabling them to effectively identify instances of hate speech and elucidate the contextual nuances surrounding them. By leveraging the inherent structure of social networks and textual data, our approach offers a comprehensive understanding of how hate speech propagates in online discourse. In future research, exploring the integration of multimodal data sources, such as images and videos, could enhance the robustness of hate speech detection models, particularly in detecting nuanced forms of Islamophobic content. Additionally, investigating the dynamic nature of online communities and incorporating temporal aspects into GNN architectures could provide deeper insights into the evolution of hate speech propagation and enable more proactive interventions to counter its spread. 4 7 Conclusion Identifying and addressing Islamophobic hatred on social media is crucial for achieving harmony and peace. This research presents a novel method using GNNs to detect hate speech towards Islam. Empirical findings demonstrate that our model achieves exceptional performance, significantly outperforming all others, with XG-HSI-BERT achieving the highest accuracy (0.741) and Macro F1 (0.747). Explainability aspect of this approach is also very promising, as it provides insights into both correlations and causation. This further highlights the potential of GNNs in combating online hate speech and fostering a safer, more inclusive online environment. Limitations The limitations include the use of only one dataset, which, while sufficient for this initial exploration, should be expanded upon in future research to validate and extend our findings. Additionally, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are known to be computationally intensive, especially with large- scale datasets, the relatively limited number of hate speech keywords suggests that GNNs may still be highly effective. Furthermore, more efficient GNN training methods are now available, which address some of the computational challenges in future applications. Ethical Implications Our work on using GNNs to detect hate speech targeting Islam carries significant ethical responsibili- ties. We focus on minimizing biases in the model to ensure fair treatment of all groups, emphasizing the need for transparency in how the model arrives at its decisions. By using interpretable GNN methods, we strive to provide clear explanations for the model’s classifications, allowing for greater accountability. We also acknowledge the potential risks of misuse and take steps to prevent these, adhering to ethical guidelines that respect privacy and avoid unjust censorship. Societal Implications The societal impact lies in its potential to create a safer online environment by effectively identifying and mitigating Islamophobic content. By enhancing the detection accuracy and providing clear explanations for the identified hate speech, our model contributes to fostering more inclusive and respectful online communities. Additionally, our work highlights the importance of combating digital hate speech, which can lead to real-world harm. We aim to empower platforms and policymakers with tools that uphold freedom of expression while curbing harmful rhetoric, thus promoting social harmony and understanding. Potential Risks The application of our model presents several risks. One major concern is the potential for model misclassification, which could lead to false positives or negatives, impacting users unfairly. Addition- ally, there is a risk of over-reliance on automated systems, which might not capture nuanced contexts and could inadvertently suppress legitimate speech. Annotation errors can also induce bias, but as we used a previously peer-reviewed benchmark dataset, we hope those type of concerns are already addressed.

P032.pdf,"Exploring the Transcendental Nexus of Water and Quasars in a Post-Modern Paradigm Abstract The aquatic nuances of water traverse a plethora of disciplines, intersecting with florid extrapolations of gastrological proportions, while concurrently juxtaposing the ephemeral nature of glacial reminiscences, which oscillate between the dichoto- mous realms of hydrological certainties and esoteric mystifications of culinary arts, amidst an existential skirmish with cognitive dissonance, meanwhile the flavonoid compounds in various plant species converge to form an amalgam of gastronomical delights, essentially, the ontological status of water remains an enigma, shrouded in mystery and speculation, as we ponder the interstices of its molecular structure, and the consequences of its presence on our planet, which is to say, the labyrinthine complexities of water’s essence, in four words, defy rational comprehension. 1 Introduction In order to fully grasp the implications of this conundrum, one must delve into the rarefied realm of theoretical hydrodynamics, where the Navier-Stokes equations converge with the vagaries of postmodern literary theory, thereby creating a symbiotic relationship between the fluid dynamics of water and the hermeneutic circularity of interpretive frameworks, which in turn, precipitate a crisis of representation, wherein the signifier and signified engage in a dialectical waltz, culminating in an aporia of meaning, that is to say, the semiotics of water, and its ancillary discourses, instantiate a regime of truth, that is at once, both fecund and treacherous, much like the unpredictability of turbulent flows, and the capricious nature of human existence, which is inextricably linked to the diaphanous veil of water’s ontological mystery. The investigation of water’s properties, and its multifaceted relationships with various disciplines, necessitates an interdisciplinary approach, one that navigates the interfaces between physics, philoso- phy, literature, and cuisine, in order to distill the essence of water, and unveil the enigmas that shroud its being, thereby instantiating a new paradigm of understanding, that transcends the boundaries of traditional epistemological frameworks, and ushers in a novel era of hydrological inquiry, wherein the pursuit of knowledge is tantamount to a existential quest, that is at once, both deeply personal, and profoundly universal, much like the flowing waters, that meander through the labyrinthine corridors of human existence, and the fluid dynamics of water, that underlie the intricacies of its molecular structure, which in turn, precipitate a cascade of phenomena, that defy rational comprehension, and instantiate a regime of wonder, that is at once, both awe-inspiring, and humbling, in its sheer complexity, and ontological profundity. Thus, the study of water, in all its manifestations, and ancillary discourses, constitutes a odyssey of discovery, that navigates the interstices of human knowledge, and precipitates a crisis of understanding, wherein the researcher is confronted with the limits of language, and the boundaries of human cognition, which in turn, instantiate a novel era of hydrological inquiry, that is at once, both deeply philosophical, and profoundly scientific, much like the flowing waters, that meander through the labyrinthine corridors of human existence, and the fluid dynamics of water, that underlie the intricacies of its molecular structure. The ostensibly mundane concept of water has been obfuscated by an plethora of trifling details, thereby necessitating a thorough examination of its purported effects on the global dissemination of fungal hyphae, which, in turn, has been linked to the ontological implications of pastry dough on the space-time continuum. Moreover, the ephemeral nature of water’s molecular structure has been shown to be intimately connected to the aerodynamic properties of narwhal tusks, which, when taken in conjunction with the principles of harmonic convergence, yields a fascinating glimpse into the hermeneutics of interpretive dance. It is within this framework that we must consider the putative role of water as a catalyst for the emergence of complex systems, particularly in regards to the self-organization of sentient puddings, which, according to some scholars, possess a latent form of consciousness that is capable of interfacing with the global network of interconnected toaster appliances. The multifaceted relationship between water and the human experience has been the subject of much speculation, with some researchers positing that the molecular structure of water is, in fact, a manifestation of the collective unconscious, as postulated by the Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, who, incidentally, was known to be an avid enthusiast of Extreme Ironing, a sport that involves ironing clothes in remote and often inhospitable locations. This has led some to suggest that the seemingly innocuous act of ironing a shirt is, in reality, a form of ritualistic communion with the fundamental forces of nature, which, when considered in conjunction with the principles of quantum mechanics, yields a profound insight into the ontological status of socks. Furthermore, the role of water in shaping the course of human history has been grossly underestimated, as evidenced by the fact that the ancient Egyptians were known to have worshipped a deity dedicated to the worship of door knobs, which, when turned in a counterclockwise direction, were believed to unlock the secrets of the universe. In addition to its numerous practical applications, water has also been implicated in a wide range of paranormal phenomena, including, but not limited to, the manifestation of ghostly apparitions, the movement of objects through telekinesis, and the ability to communicate with animals through a process known as ""animal whispering,"" which, according to some experts, is made possible by the unique acoustic properties of the human nose. The notion that water is, in some way, connected to the supernatural has been a persistent theme throughout human history, with many cultures believing that water is a gateway to the spirit world, a realm that is inhabited by a wide range of mythical creatures, including, but not limited to, the Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot, and the Chupacabra. This has led some researchers to propose the existence of a heretofore unknown form of aquatic life, one that is capable of surviving in the most extreme environments, including, but not limited to, the depths of the ocean, the surface of the sun, and the interior of a black hole. The concept of water as a universal solvent has been challenged by recent discoveries in the field of materials science, which have led to the development of a new class of super-absorbent materials that are capable of absorbing up to 1000 times their weight in water, a property that has been attributed to the unique molecular structure of these materials, which, when examined under an electron microscope, reveal a complex pattern of molecular interactions that are reminiscent of the intricate patterns found in the art of Islamic geometry. This has significant implications for our understanding of the role of water in shaping the physical world, particularly in regards to the formation of geological structures, such as rocks and mountains, which, when considered in conjunction with the principles of plate tectonics, yield a fascinating glimpse into the dynamic and constantly evolving nature of the Earth’s surface. The relationship between water and the human body has been the subject of much research, with some studies suggesting that the human brain is, in fact, composed of up to 90 The study of water has also been influenced by the principles of postmodernism, which have led some researchers to question the notion of an objective reality, instead proposing that reality is, in fact, a social construct, a notion that has been applied to the study of water, with some researchers arguing that the properties of water are, in fact, a product of our collective perception, a notion that has been supported by the fact that the boiling point of water is, in fact, a function of the altitude at which it is measured, a property that has been attributed to the effects of gravity on the molecular structure of water. This has significant implications for our understanding of the role of water in shaping the physical world, particularly in regards to the formation of weather patterns, which, when considered in conjunction with the principles of complexity theory, yield a fascinating glimpse into the dynamic and constantly evolving nature of the Earth’s atmosphere. 2 The notion that water is, in some way, connected to the concept of time has been a persistent theme throughout human history, with many cultures believing that water is a symbol of the passage of time, a notion that has been supported by the fact that the flow of water is, in fact, a fundamental aspect of the natural world, a property that has been attributed to the unique properties of the universe, which, when considered in conjunction with the principles of quantum mechanics, yield a profound insight into the nature of time itself. This has led some researchers to propose the existence of a previously unknown form of temporal function, one that is dependent on the unique properties of water, which, when considered in conjunction with the principles of general relativity, yield a fascinating glimpse into the nature of space-time and the human experience. The relationship between water and the natural world has been the subject of much research, with some studies suggesting that the unique properties of water are, in fact, a product of the complex interactions between the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and landmasses, a notion that has been supported by the fact that the Earth’s climate is, in fact, a highly dynamic and constantly evolving system, a property that has been attributed to the effects of global warming, a phenomenon that has been linked to the increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere. This has significant implications for our understanding of the role of water in shaping the physical world, particularly in regards to the formation of weather patterns, which, when considered in conjunction with the principles of chaos theory, yield a fascinating glimpse into the dynamic and constantly evolving nature of the Earth’s atmosphere. The study of water has also been influenced by the principles of feminist theory, which have led some researchers to question the notion of a patriarchal society, instead proposing that the properties of water are, in fact, a product of a matriarchal society, a notion that has been supported by the fact that the unique properties of water are, in fact, a product of the complex interactions between the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and landmasses, a property that has been attributed to the effects of the goddess energy, a concept that has been linked to the worship of ancient fertility deities, which, when considered in conjunction with the principles of postcolonial theory, yield a profound insight into the nature of power and oppression. The concept of water as a symbol of spiritual renewal has been a persistent theme throughout human history, with many cultures believing that water is, in fact, a symbol of the soul, a notion that has been supported by the fact that the unique properties of water are, in fact, a product of the complex interactions between the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and landmasses, a property that has been attributed to the effects of the divine, a concept that has been linked to the worship of ancient deities, which, when considered in conjunction with the principles of hermeneutics, yield a fascinating glimpse into the nature of human consciousness and the human experience.

Initially, we immersed ourselves in the realm of theoretical frameworks, navigating the intricate complexities of fluid dynamics, while concurrently studying the art of playing the harmonica underwater. This led to the development of a novel hypothesis, proposing that the viscosity of water is directly proportional to the number of forgotten socks in a given laundry load. Furthermore, our research team discovered that the molecular structure of water bears an uncanny resemblance to the branching patterns of fir trees, which in turn, is influenced by the migratory patterns of narwhals. The experimental design involved the construction of a large, aquatic-themed pinball machine, which was used to simulate the turbulent flow of water through a series of winding channels and narrow straits. This apparatus enabled us to collect valuable data on the relationship between water pressure and the aerodynamics of flying spaghetti monsters. Moreover, we conducted a thorough analysis of the sonic properties of water, revealing a surprising correlation between the resonant frequency of a glass of water and the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow. In addition to these experiments, our team also explored the applications of water in various fields, including medicine, astronomy, and competitive snail racing. We found that the viscosity of water plays a crucial role in the treatment of certain diseases, such as the dreaded ""flumplenook syndrome,"" which is characterized by an excessive accumulation of jellyfish in the patient’s nostrils. Moreover, our research demonstrated that water is essential for the survival of certain extraterrestrial life forms, which communicate through a complex system of aquatic-themed hieroglyphics. The data collection process involved the use of advanced, high-tech equipment, including a custom- built, underwater harmonica-playing robot, which was capable of transmitting data wirelessly to our research headquarters via a network of trained, messenger seagulls. We also employed a team of skilled, professional line dancers to collect data on the surface tension of water, using a technique known as ""hydro-line dancing."" This innovative approach allowed us to gather accurate measurements of the water’s surface tension, while simultaneously creating a dazzling display of choreographed dance moves. Furthermore, our research team conducted an exhaustive review of existing literature on the subject of water, including ancient texts, such as the ""Aquatic Epics of Atlantis"" and the ""Lost Scrolls of the Deep."" We discovered that these ancient civilizations possessed a profound understanding of the properties and behaviors of water, which they used to build sophisticated, aquatic-based technologies, such as the ""Infinite Improbability Drive"" and the ""Transdimensional Toaster."" These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the role of water in modern society and its potential applications in various fields. The next phase of our research involved the development of a new, groundbreaking theory, which we termed ""hydro-quantum entanglement."" This theory proposes that the molecules of water are connected through a complex network of quantum entanglements, which allow them to communicate with each other instantaneously, regardless of the distance between them. We tested this theory using a series of experiments, involving the simultaneous measurement of water pressure and quantum fluctuations in a sealed, underwater container. The results were astounding, revealing a statistically significant correlation between the two variables, which challenges our current understanding of the fundamental laws of physics. In another line of investigation, we explored the relationship between water and the human brain, discovering that the molecular structure of water is eerily similar to the neural patterns of a dreaming brain. This led us to propose a new hypothesis, suggesting that the human brain is capable of communicating with water molecules through a process of quantum entanglement, allowing us to tap into the collective unconscious of the aquatic world. We tested this hypothesis using a series of experiments, involving the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the brain activity of subjects while they were submerged in a tank of water. The results were nothing short of astonishing, revealing a significant increase in brain activity in areas associated with creativity, imagination, and aquatic-themed thought patterns. Moreover, our research team investigated the potential applications of water in the field of artificial intelligence, discovering that the molecular structure of water can be used to create sophisticated, 6 aquatic-based neural networks. We developed a novel algorithm, which we termed ""hydro-AI,"" which uses the properties of water to simulate the behavior of complex, adaptive systems. This algorithm has significant implications for the development of more advanced, autonomous systems, which can learn and adapt in response to changing environmental conditions. The investigation of water also led us to explore the realm of aquatic-themed mythology and folklore, where we discovered a rich tapestry of stories and legends surrounding the mystical properties of water. We found that many ancient cultures believed in the existence of magical, aquatic creatures, such as mermaids and sea serpents, which were said to possess the power to control the forces of nature. We analyzed these myths and legends, using a combination of anthropological and psychological techniques, and discovered that they contain hidden patterns and codes, which can be used to unlock the secrets of the aquatic world. In addition to these findings, our research team also made several groundbreaking discoveries in the field of aquatic-themed cuisine, developing a series of novel, water-based recipes, which have significant implications for the culinary arts. We discovered that the molecular structure of water can be used to create complex, flavorful sauces and marinades, which can enhance the texture and taste of a wide range of dishes. We also developed a new, aquatic-themed cooking technique, which we termed ""hydro-culinary fusion,"" which involves the use of water to combine and transform different ingredients into new, innovative creations. The experimental results were then analyzed using a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques, including regression analysis, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. We found that the data exhibited a complex, nonlinear structure, which could be modeled using a combination of fractal geometry and chaos theory. The results of this analysis revealed a number of significant patterns and trends, which have important implications for our understanding of the properties and behaviors of water. Furthermore, we discovered that the data contained a number of hidden, aquatic- themed messages and codes, which can be deciphered using a combination of cryptographic and aquatic-themed analysis techniques. In conclusion, the investigation of water has led to a number of groundbreaking discoveries and insights, which have significant implications for our understanding of the properties and behaviors of this complex, multifaceted substance. The findings of this research have the potential to revolutionize a wide range of fields, from medicine and astronomy to cuisine and artificial intelligence. As we continue to explore the mysteries of water, we may uncover even more surprising and unexpected secrets, which will challenge our current understanding of the world and our place within it. The research also involved the use of advanced, aquatic-themed simulation software, which allowed us to model and simulate the behavior of complex, aquatic systems. We used this software to study the dynamics of ocean currents, the behavior of aquatic ecosystems, and the impact of human activities on the aquatic environment. The results of these simulations revealed a number of significant patterns and trends, which have important implications for our understanding of the aquatic world and its role in the Earth’s ecosystem.

P033.pdf,"AMR Parsing using Stack-LSTMs Abstract We present a transition-based AMR parser that directly generates AMR parses from plain text. We use Stack-LSTMs to represent our parser state and make decisions greedily. In our experiments, we show that our parser achieves very competitive scores on English using only AMR training data. Adding additional information, such as POS tags and dependency trees, improves the results further. 1 Introduction Transition-based algorithms for natural language parsing are formulated as a series of decisions that read words from a buffer and incrementally combine them to form syntactic structures in a stack. Apart from dependency parsing, these models, also known as shift-reduce algorithms, have been successfully applied to tasks like phrase-structure parsing, named entity recognition, CCG parsing, joint syntactic and semantic parsing and even abstract- meaning representation parsing. AMR parsing requires solving several natural language processing tasks; mainly named entity recognition, word sense disambiguation and joint syntactic and semantic role labeling. Given the difficulty of building an end-to-end system, most prior work is based on pipelines or heavily dependent on precalculated features. Inspired by we present a shift- reduce algorithm that produces AMR graphs directly from plain text. presented transition-based tree-to-graph transducers that traverse a dependency tree and transforms it to an AMR graph. input is a sentence and it is therefore more similar (with a different parsing algorithm) to our approach, but their parser relies on external tools, such as dependency parsing, semantic role labeling or named entity recognition. The input of our parser is plain text sentences and, through rich word representations, it predicts all actions (in a single algorithm) needed to generate an AMR graph representation for an input sentence; it handles the detection and annotation of named entities, word sense disambiguation and it makes connections between the nodes detected towards building a predicate argument structure. Even though the system that runs with just words is very competitive, we further improve the results incorporating POS tags and dependency trees into our model. Stack-LSTMs have proven to be useful in tasks related to syntactic and semantic parsing and named entity recognition. In this paper, we demonstrate that they can be effectively used for AMR parsing as well. 2 Parsing Algorithm Our parsing algorithm makes use of a STACK (that stores AMR nodes and/or words) and a BUFFER that contains the words that have yet to be processed. The parsing algorithm is inspired from the semantic actions presented by , the transition-based NER algorithm by and the arc-standard algorithm. As in the buffer starts with the root symbol at the end of the sequence. Figure 2 shows a running example. The transition inventory is the following: • SHIFT: pops the front of the BUFFER and push it to the STACK. • CONFIRM: calls a subroutine that predicts the AMR node corresponding to the top of the STACK. It then pops the word from the STACK and pushes the AMR node to the STACK. An example is the prediction of a propbank sense: From occurred to occur-01. • REDUCE: pops the top of the STACK. It occurs when the word/node at the top of the stack is complete (no more actions can be applied to it). Note that it can also be applied to words that do not appear in the final output graph, and thus they are directly discarded. • MERGE: pops the two nodes at the top of the STACK and then it merges them, it then pushes the resulting node to the top of STACK. Note that this can be applied recursively. This action serves to get multiword named entities (e.g. New York City). • ENTITY(label): labels the node at the top of the STACK with an entity label. This action serves to label named entities, such as New York City or Madrid and it is normally run after MERGE when it is a multi-word named entity, or after SHIFT if it is a single-word named entity. • DEPENDENT(label,node): creates a new node in the AMR graph that is dependent on the node at the top of the STACK. An example is the introduction of a negative polarity to a given node: From illegal to (legal, polarity -). • LA(label) and RA(label): create a left/right arc with the top two nodes at the top of the STACK. They keep both the head and the dependent in the stack to allow reentrancies (multiple incoming edges). The head is now a composition of the head and the dependent. They are enriched with the AMR label. • SWAP: pops the two top items at the top of the STACK, pushes the second node to the front of the BUFFER, and pushes the first one back into the STACK. This action allows non- projective arcs as in but it also helps to introduce reentrancies. At oracle time, SWAP is produced when the word at the top of the stack is blocking actions that may happen between the second element at the top of the stack and any of the words in the buffer. Figure 1 shows the parser actions and the effect on the parser state (contents of the stack, buffer) and how the graph is changed after applying the actions. We implemented an oracle that produces the sequence of actions that leads to the gold (or close to gold) AMR graph. In order to map words in the sentences to nodes in the AMR graph we need to align them. We use the JAMR aligner provided by. It is important to mention that even though the aligner is quite accurate, it is not perfect, producing a F1 score of around 0.90. This means that most sentences have at least one alignment error which implies that our oracle is not capable of perfectly reproducing all AMR graphs. This has a direct impact on the accuracy of the parser described in the next section since it is trained on sequences of actions that are not perfect. The oracle achieves 0.895 F1 Smatch score when it is run on the development set of the LDC2014T12. The algorithm allows a set of different constraints that varies from the basic ones (not allowing impossible actions such as SHIFT when the buffer is empty or not generating arcs when the words have not yet been CONFIRMed and thus transformed to nodes) to more complicated ones based on the propbank candidates and number of arguments. We choose to constrain the parser to the basic ones and let it learn the more complicated ones. (r / recommend-01 :ARG1 (a / advocate-01 :ARG1 (i / it) :manner (v / vigorous))) 3 Parsing Model In this section, we revisit Stack-LSTMs, our parsing model and our word representations. 3.1 Stack-LSTMs The stack LSTM is an augmented LSTM that allows adding new inputs in the same way as LSTMs but it also provides a POP operation that moves a pointer to the previous element. The output vector of the LSTM will consider the stack pointer instead of the rightmost position of the sequence. 2 Stackt Buffert Action Stackt + 1 Buffert + 1 Graph u, S B SHIFT u, S B – u, S B CONFIRM n, S B – u, S B REDUCE S B – u, v, S B MERGE (u, v), S B – u, S B ENTITY(l) (u : l), S B – u, S B DEPENDENT(r, d) u, S B r →d u, v, S B RA(r) u, v, S B r →v u, v, S B LA(r) u, v, S B r ←v u, v, S B SWAP u, S v, B – Table 1: Parser transitions indicating the action applied to the stack and buffer and the resulting state.

R represents the root symbol 3 3.2 Representing the State and Making Parsing Decisions The state of the algorithm presented in Section 2 is represented by the contents of the STACK, BUFFER and a list with the history of actions (which are encoded as Stack-LSTMs). All of this forms the vector st that represents the state which s calculated as follows: st = max{0, W[st t; bt; at] + d}, where W is a learned parameter matrix, d is a bias term and st t, bt,at represent the output vector of the Stack-LSTMs at time t. Predicting the Actions: Our model then uses the vector st for each timestep t to compute the probability of the next action as: p(z|st) = exp(gz.st+qz) P z′∈A exp(g′z.st+q′z), where gz is a column vector representing the (output) embedding of the action z, and qz is a bias term for action z. The set A represents the actions listed in Section 2. Note that due to parsing constraints the set of possible actions may vary. The total number of actions (in the LDC2014T12 dataset) is 478; note that they include all possible labels (in the case of LA and RA ) and the different dependent nodes for the DEPENDENT action. Predicting the Nodes: When the model selects the action CONFIRM, the model needs to decide the AMR node that corresponds to the word at the top of the STACK, by using st, as follows: p(e|st) = exp(ge.st+qe) P e′∈N exp(ge′.st+qe′), where N is the set of possible candidate nodes for the word at the top of the STACK. ge is a column vector representing the (output) embedding of the node e, and qe is a bias term for the node e. It is important to mention that this implies finding a propbank sense or a lemma. For that, we rely entirely on the AMR training set instead of using additional resources. Given that the system runs two softmax operations, one to predict the action to take and the second one to predict the corresponding AMR node, and they both share LSTMs to make predictions, we include an additional layer with a tanh nonlinearity after st for each softmax. 3.3 Word Representations We use character-based representations of words using bidirectional LSTMs . They learn represen- tations for words that are orthographically similar. Note that they are updated with the updates to the model. demonstrated that it is possible to achieve high results in syntactic parsing and named entity recognition by just using character-based word representations (not even POS tags, in fact, in some cases the results with just character-based representations outperform those that used explicit POS tags since they provide similar vectors for words with similar/same morphosyntactic tag); in this paper we show a similar result given that both syntactic parsing and named-entity recognition play a central role in AMR parsing. These are concatenated with pretrained word embeddings. We use a variant of the skip n-gram model with the LDC English Gigaword corpus (version 5). These embeddings encode the syntactic behavior of the words . More formally, to represent each input token, we concatenate two vectors: a learned character-based representation ( ˆwC); and a fixed vector representation from a neural language model ( ˆwLM). A linear map (V) is applied to the resulting vector and passed through a component-wise ReLU, x = max{0, V [ ˆwC; ˆwLM] + b}. where V is a learned parameter matrix, b is a bias term and wC is the character-based learned representation for each word, ˆwLM is the pretrained word representation. 3.4 POS Tagging and Dependency Parsing We may include preprocessed POS tags or dependency parses to incorporate more information into our model. For the POS tags we use the Stanford tagger while we use the Stack-LSTM parser trained on the English CoNLL 2009 dataset to get the dependencies. 4 Model F1(Newswire) F1(ALL) (POS, DEP) 0.59 0.58 (POS, DEP, NER) - 0.66 (POS, DEP, NER) 0.62 - (POS, DEP, NER, SRL) - 0.61 (POS, DEP, NER, SRL) - 0.64 (POS, CCG) 0.66 - (POS, DEP, NER) 0.70 - (POS, DEP, NER, SRL) 0.71 0.66 (LM, NER) - 0.61 (Wordnet, LM, NER) - 0.66 (POS, DEP, NER) 0.63 0.59 (POS, DEP, NER, SRL) 0.70 0.66 OUR PARSER (NO PRETRAINED-NO CHARS) 0.64 0.59 OUR PARSER (NO PRETRAINED-WITH CHARS) 0.66 0.61 OUR PARSER (WITH PRETRAINED-NO CHARS) 0.66 0.62 OUR PARSER 0.68 0.63 OUR PARSER (POS) 0.68 0.63 OUR PARSER (POS, DEP) 0.69 0.64 Table 3: AMR results on the LDC2014T12 dataset; Newsire section (left) and full (right). Rows labeled with OUR-PARSER show our results. POS indicates that the system uses preprocessed POS tags, DEP indicates that it uses preprocessed dependency trees, SRL indicates that it uses preprocessed semantic roles, NER indicates that it uses preprocessed named entitites. LM indicates that it uses a LM trained on AMR data and WordNet indicates that it uses WordNet to predict the concepts. Systems marked with * are pipeline systems that require a dependency parse as input. (WITH PRETRAINED-NO CHARS) shows the results of our parser without character-based representations. (NO PRETRAINED-WITH CHARS) shows results without pretrained word embeddings. (NO PRETRAINED-NO CHARS) shows results without character-based representations and without pretrained word embeddings. The rest of our results include both pretrained embeddings and character- based representations. POS tags: The POS tags are preprocessed and a learned representation tag is concatenated with the word representations. This is the same setting as . Dependency Trees: We use them in the same way as POS tags by concatenating a learned representa- tion dep of the dependency label to the parent with the word representation. Additionally, we enrich the state representation st, presented in Section 3.2. If the two words at the top of the STACK have a dependency between them, st is enriched with a learned representation that indicates that and the direction; otherwise st remains unchanged. st is calculated as follows: st = max{0, W[st t; bt; at; dept] + d}, where dept is the learned vector that represents that there is an arc between the two top words at the top of the stack. 4 Experiments and Results We use the LDC2014T12 dataset for our experiments. Table 1 shows results, including comparison with prior work that are also evaluated on the same dataset. Our model achieves 0.68 F1 in the newswire section of the test set just by using character-based representations of words and pretrained word embeddings. All prior work uses lemmatizers, POS taggers, dependency parsers, named entity recognizers and semantic role labelers that use additional training data while we achieve competitive scores without that. reports 0.66 F1 in the full test by using WordNet for concept identification, but their performance drops to 0.61 without WordNet. It is worth noting that we achieved 0.64 in the same test set without WordNet. without SRL (via Propbank) achieves only 0.63 in the newswire test set while we achieved 0.69 without SRL (and 0.68 without dependency trees). 5 In order to see whether pretrained word embeddings and character-based embeddings are useful we carried out an ablation study by showing the results of our parser with and without character-based representations (replaced by standard lookup table learned embeddings) and with and without pre- trained word embeddings. By looking at the results of the parser without character-based embeddings but with pretrained word embeddings we observe that the character- based representation of words are useful since they help to achieve 2 points better in the Newswire dataset and 1 point more in the full test set. The parser with character-based embeddings but without pretrained word embeddings, the parser has more difficulty to learn and only achieves 0.61 in the full test set. Finally, the model that does not use neither character-based embeddings nor pretrained word embeddings is the worst achieving only 0.59 in the full test set, note that this model has no explicity way of getting any syntactic information through the word embeddings nor a smart way to handle out of vocabulary words. All the systems marked with * require that the input is a dependency tree, which means that they solve a transduction task between a dependency tree and an AMR graph. Even though our parser starts from plain text sentences when we incorporate more information into our model, we achieve further improvements. POS tags provide small improvements (0.6801 without POS tags vs 0.6822 for the model that runs with POS tags). Dependency trees help a bit more achieving 0.6920. 5 Conclusions and Future Work We present a new transition-based algorithm for AMR parsing and we implement it using Stack- LSTMS and a greedy decoder. We present competitive results, without any additional resources and external tools. Just by looking at the words, we achieve 0.68 F1 (and 0.69 by preprocessing dependency trees) in the standard dataset used for evaluation. 6",1,,,,

P035.pdf,"Enhanced Normalization in Vision Transformers: The Dual PatchNorm Approach Abstract This study introduces Dual PatchNorm, a modification for Vision Transformers that incorporates two Layer Normalization layers (LayerNorms) positioned before and after the patch embedding layer. The effectiveness of Dual PatchNorm is demonstrated through its superior performance compared to alternative LayerNorm placement strategies within the Transformer block, as determined through extensive testing. Experimental results across various tasks, including image classification, contrastive learning, semantic segmentation, and transfer learning on downstream classification datasets, consistently show that this simple adjustment leads to improved accuracy over well-optimized standard Vision Transformers, without any negative impact. 1 Introduction Layer Normalization is essential for the successful and stable training of Transformer models, enabling high performance across diverse tasks. This normalization technique is equally vital in Vision Transformers (ViTs), which largely adhere to the standard architecture of the original Transformer model. This research investigates whether a different arrangement of LayerNorms can enhance ViT models. Initially, we evaluate five ViT architectures on ImageNet-1k and find that an exhaustive search for optimal LayerNorm placements within the Transformer block’s components does not yield improvements in classification accuracy. This suggests that the pre-LN approach in ViTs is nearly optimal. Further investigation reveals that alternative LayerNorm placements, such as NormFormer and Sub-LN, also do not surpass the performance of robust ViT classification models when used independently. A significant finding of this study is the observation that the addition of LayerNorms before and after the standard ViT-projection layer, termed Dual PatchNorm (DPN), can substantially improve performance over well-tuned baseline ViTs. Experiments conducted on image classification across three datasets with varying sample sizes, as well as contrastive learning, confirm the effectiveness of DPN. Notably, qualitative analysis indicates that the LayerNorm scale parameters assign greater weight to pixels located at the center and corners of each patch. 2 Related Work Prior research has explored modifications to the patch-embedding layer in ViTs. For instance, one study demonstrated that adding a LayerNorm after patch-embedding enhances ViT’s resilience to image corruptions on smaller datasets. Another study replaced the standard Transformer stem with a series of stacked stride-two 3x3 convolutions with batch normalizations, resulting in improved sensitivity to optimization hyperparameters and increased final accuracy. Further analysis of LayerNorm has shown that the derivatives of the mean and variance significantly contribute to performance, as opposed to forward normalization. Alternative strategies like Image-LN and Patch-LN have been considered for efficiently training a single model across different patch sizes. Some researchers have added extra LayerNorms before the final dense projection in the self-attention block and the non-linearity in the MLP block, employing a different initialization strategy. Others have proposed adding LayerNorms after the final dense projection in the self-attention block, along with a LayerNorm after the non-linearity in the MLP block. In contrast to previous studies, our work demonstrates that applying LayerNorms both before and after the embedding layer consistently enhances performance in classification and contrastive learning tasks. While other research has focused on incorporating convolutional inductive biases into Vision Transformers, our study exclusively and thoroughly examines LayerNorm placements within the standard ViT architecture. 3 Methodology 3.1 Patch Embedding Layer in Vision Transformer Vision Transformers consist of a patch embedding layer (PE) followed by multiple Transformer blocks. The PE layer first transforms an image x ∈RH×W ×3 into a sequence of patches xp ∈RP 2×P 2HW , where P is the patch size. Each patch is then independently projected using a dense layer, creating a sequence of ""visual tokens"" xt ∈RHW P 2×D. The patch size P determines the trade-off between the granularity of the visual tokens and the computational demands of subsequent Transformer layers. 3.2 Layer Normalization When applied to a sequence of N patches x ∈RN×D, LayerNorm in ViTs involves two steps: x = x −µ(x) σ(x) (1) y = γx + β (2) where µ(x) ∈RN, σ(x) ∈RN, γ ∈RD, and β ∈RD. First, Equation 3.1 normalizes each patch xi ∈RD in the sequence to have zero mean and unit standard deviation. Then, Equation 3.2 applies learnable shifts and scales β and γ, which are shared across all patches. 3.3 Alternate LayerNorm placements: Following established practices, ViTs typically place LayerNorms before each self-attention and MLP layer, known as the pre-LN strategy. We assess three different strategies for each self-attention and MLP layer: placing LayerNorm before (pre-LN), after (post-LN), and both before and after (pre+post-LN). This results in nine distinct combinations. 3.4 Dual PatchNorm Instead of adding LayerNorms within the Transformer block, we propose applying them to the stem alone, both before and after the patch embedding layer. Specifically, we replace: x = PE(x) (3) with x = LN(PE(LN(x))) (4) while keeping the rest of the architecture unchanged. We refer to this approach as Dual PatchNorm (DPN). 4 Experiments 4.1 Setup We utilize the standard Vision Transformer formulation, which has demonstrated broad applicability across various vision tasks. We train ViT architectures, both with and without DPN, in a supervised manner on three datasets with varying numbers of examples: ImageNet-1k (1M), ImageNet-21k (21M), and JFT (4B). In our experiments, we apply DPN directly to the baseline ViT recipes without any additional hyperparameter tuning. We divide the ImageNet training set into training and validation subsets and use the validation set to finalize the DPN recipe. For ImageNet-1k, we train five architectures: Ti/16, S/16, S/32, B/16, and B/32 using a standard recipe for 93,000 steps with a batch size of 4,096. We report the accuracy on the official ImageNet validation split. Additionally, we evaluate an S/16 baseline (S/16+) with extensive hyperparameter tuning on ImageNet. We also apply DPN to the base and small DeiT variants. On ImageNet-21k, we use a similar setup as ImageNet-1k and report ImageNet 25-shot accuracies in two training regimes: 93K and 930K steps. For JFT, we evaluate the ImageNet 25-shot accuracies of three variants (B/32, B/16, and L/16) in two training regimes (220K and 1.1M steps) with a batch size of 4,096, without additional data augmentation or mixup regularization. We report the 95% confidence interval across at least three independent runs on ImageNet-1k. Due to the computational cost of training on ImageNet-21k and JFT, we train each model once and report the mean 25-shot accuracy with a 95% confidence interval across three random seeds. 2 4.2 DPN versus alternate LayerNorm placements Each Transformer block in ViT includes a self-attention (SA) and an MLP layer. Following the pre-LN strategy, LN is placed before both the SA and MLP layers. We first demonstrate that the default pre-LN strategy in ViT models is nearly optimal by evaluating alternative LN placements on ImageNet-1k. We then compare this with the performance of NormFormer, Sub-LN, and DPN. For each SA and MLP layer, we evaluate three LN placements: Pre, Post, and Pre+Post, resulting in nine total LN placement configurations. Additionally, we assess the LayerNorm placements in NormFormer and Sub LayerNorm, which add extra Layer- Norms within the self-attention and MLP layers in the transformer block. Figure 1 shows that none of these placements significantly outperform the default Pre-LN strategy, indicating that the default strategy is close to optimal. NormFormer provides some improvements on ViT models with a patch size of 32. However, DPN consistently enhances performance across all five architectures. Figure 1: This plot illustrates the accuracy gains achieved by various LayerNorm placement strategies over the default pre-LN strategy. Each blue point represents a different LN placement within the Transformer block. None of the alternative placements surpass the default Pre-LN strategy on ImageNet-1k. The application of DPN (represented by the black cross) consistently improves performance across all five architectures. 4.3 Comparison to ViT Table 1 (left) shows that DPN improved the accuracy of B/16, the best ViT model, by 0.7, while S/32 achieved the maximum accuracy gain of 1.9. The average gain across all architectures is 1.4. On top of DeiT-S and DeiT-B, DPN provides improvements of 0.3 and 0.2, respectively. Furthermore, we fine-tune B/16 and B/32 models with and without DPN on high-resolution ImageNet (384x384) for 5,000 steps with a batch size of 512. Applying DPN improves the high-resolution, fine-tuned B/16 and B/32 by 0.6 and 1.0, respectively. DPN enhances all architectures trained on ImageNet-21k (Table 1, right) and JFT (Table 2) in shorter training regimes, with average gains of 1.7 and 0.8, respectively. In longer training regimes, DPN improves the accuracy of the best-performing architectures on JFT and ImageNet-21k by 0.5 and 0.4, respectively. In three cases (Ti/16 and S/32 with ImageNet-21k, and B/16 with JFT), DPN matches or slightly underperforms compared to the baseline. Nevertheless, across a large proportion of ViT models, simply applying DPN out-of-the-box on top of well-tuned ViT baselines leads to significant improvements.

Natural datasets contain images captured with standard cameras, Specialized datasets have images from specialized equipment, and Structured datasets require scene comprehension. We use the VTAB training protocol, which defines a standard training split of 800 examples and a validation split of 200 examples per dataset. We perform a lightweight sweep across three learning rates for each dataset and select the best model based on the mean validation accuracy across three seeds. The corresponding mean test scores across three seeds are reported in Table 3. On Natural datasets, which are most similar to the source dataset ImageNet, B/32 and B/16 with DPN significantly outperform the baseline in 7 out of 7 and 6 out of 7 datasets, respectively. The only exception is Sun397, where DPN performs worse. However, additional experiments show that DPN is beneficial when B/16 is trained from scratch on Sun397. On Structured datasets, applying DPN improves accuracy in 4 out of 8 datasets and remains neutral in 2 for both B/16 and B/32. On Specialized datasets, DPN improves performance in 1 out of 4 datasets and is neutral in 2. In conclusion, DPN offers the most significant improvements when fine-tuned on Natural datasets. For Structured and Specialized datasets, DPN serves as a lightweight alternative that can enhance or at least not harm performance in most cases. Table 3: Evaluation of DPN on VTAB. When fine-tuned on Natural datasets, B/32 and B/16 with DPN significantly outperform the baseline in 7 out of 7 and 6 out of 7 datasets, respectively. On Structured datasets, DPN improves both B/16 and B/32 in 4 out of 8 datasets and remains neutral in 2. On Specialized datasets, DPN improves performance in 1 out of 4 datasets and is neutral in 2.

Each minibatch consists of image and text pairs. We train a text and image encoder to map an image to its correct text over all other texts in the minibatch. Specifically, we adopt a method where we initialize and freeze the image encoder from a pretrained checkpoint and train the text encoder from scratch. To evaluate zero-shot ImageNet accuracy, we represent each ImageNet class by its text label, which the text encoder maps into a class embedding. For a given image embedding, the prediction is the class corresponding to the nearest class embedding. 4 We evaluate four frozen image encoders: two architectures (B/32 and L/16) trained with two schedules (220K and 1.1M steps). We reuse standard hyperparameters and train only the text encoder using a contrastive loss for 55,000 steps with a batch size of 16,384. Table 4 shows that on B/32, DPN improves over the baselines in both setups, while on L/16, DPN provides improvement when the image encoder is trained with shorter training schedules.

Following established methods, a single dense layer maps the ViT features into per-patch output logits. A bilinear upsampling layer then transforms the output distribution into the final high-resolution 512x512 semantic segmentation output. We fine-tune the entire ViT backbone with a standard per-pixel cross-entropy loss. Table 5 reports the mean mIOU across 10 random seeds and different fractions of training data. The improvement in IoU is consistent across all setups.

In Eq 4, DPN applies LN to both the inputs and outputs of the embedding layer. We evaluate three alternative strategies: Pre, Post, and Post PosEmb. Pre applies LayerNorm only to the inputs, Post applies it only to the outputs, and Post PosEmb applies it to the outputs after they are summed with positional embeddings. Table 6 shows the accuracy gains with these alternative strategies. Pre is unstable on B/32, leading to a significant drop in accuracy, and it also results in minor accuracy drops on S/32 and Ti/16. Post and Post PosEmb perform worse on smaller models (B/32, S/32, and Ti/16). Our experiments demonstrate that applying LayerNorm to both inputs and outputs of the embedding layer is necessary for consistent accuracy improvements across all ViT variants. Table 6: Ablations of various components of DPN. Pre: LayerNorm only to the inputs of the embedding layer. Post: LayerNorm only to the outputs of the embedding layer. No learnable: Per-patch normalization without learnable LayerNorm parameters. Only learnable: Learnable scales and shifts without standardization.

We also ablate the effect of each of these operations in DPN. Applying only learnable scales and shifts without normalization significantly decreases accuracy across all architectures (See: Only learnable in Table 6). Additionally, removing the learnable parameters leads to unstable training on B/16 (No learnable in Table 6). Finally, removing the centering and bias parameters, as done in RMSNorm, reduces the accuracy of B/32, S/32, and Ti/16. We conclude that while both normalization and learnable parameters contribute to the success of DPN, normalization has a greater impact. 5 7 Analysis 7.1 Gradient Norm Scale We present per-layer gradient norms for B/16, both with and without DPN. Figure 2 (Left) displays the mean gradient norm of the last 1000 training steps as a function of depth. Notably, the gradient norm of the base ViT patch embedding (black) is disproportionately large compared to other layers. Applying DPN (red) scales down the gradient norm of the embedding layer. Figure 2 (Right) further shows that the gradient norm of the embedding layer is reduced not only before convergence but also throughout the training process. This characteristic is consistent across ViT architectures of different sizes. 7.2 Visualizing Scale Parameters The first LayerNorm in Eq. 4 is applied directly to patches, i.e., raw pixels. Thus, the learnable parameters (biases and scales) of the first LayerNorm can be visualized directly in pixel space. Figure 3 shows the scales of our smallest and largest models: Ti/16 trained on ImageNet for 90,000 steps and L/16 trained on JFT for 1.1M steps, respectively. Since the absolute magnitude of the scale parameters varies across the R, G, and B channels, we visualize the scale separately for each channel. Interestingly, for both models, the scale parameter increases the weight of the pixels in the center of the patch and at the corners. 8 Conclusion We propose a straightforward modification to standard ViT models 6 ",1,,,,
P036.pdf,"Game-Theoretic Optimization for Crowdsourced Delivery Networks: A Novel Approach to Harnessing the Power of the Crowd in Last-Mile Logistics Abstract Game-Theoretic Optimization for Crowdsourced Delivery Networks is a burgeon- ing field of research that seeks to improve the efficiency and reliability of delivery systems by leveraging the power of crowdsourced labor. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the way goods are transported and delivered, particularly in urban areas where traditional delivery methods often struggle to cope with high demand and congested infrastructure. By applying game-theoretic principles to the optimization of crowdsourced delivery networks, researchers can develop more effective and sustainable solutions that balance the needs of multiple stakeholders, including delivery companies, crowdsourced workers, and end customers. How- ever, this approach also raises important questions about the potential for chaos and unpredictability in crowdsourced systems, and the need for novel methodologies that can account for the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these networks. In- terestingly, our research reveals that the application of game-theoretic optimization to crowdsourced delivery networks can lead to emergent behaviors that resemble the flocking patterns of birds, suggesting a potentially fruitful area of investigation at the intersection of logistics, economics, and ornithology. 1 Introduction The rise of crowdsourced delivery networks has revolutionized the way goods are transported, lever- aging a vast network of independent drivers to efficiently deliver packages to customers. However, this paradigm shift has also introduced a plethora of complex optimization problems, as the inherent unpredictability of crowdsourced systems can lead to inefficiencies and decreased customer satisfac- tion. To mitigate these issues, researchers have begun to explore the application of game-theoretic optimization techniques, which model the interactions between independent agents in a crowdsourced network as a competitive game. By analyzing the strategic decision-making processes of these agents, game-theoretic optimization can provide valuable insights into the underlying dynamics of crowdsourced delivery networks, enabling the design of more efficient and scalable systems. One intriguing approach to optimizing crowdsourced delivery networks involves the use of evolution- ary game theory, where the behavior of agents is modeled as an evolutionary process, with strategies evolving over time through a process of natural selection. This perspective allows researchers to study the emergence of cooperative behavior among agents, which can lead to improved overall system performance. However, an unexpected consequence of this approach is the potential for the emergence of ""cheating"" strategies, where agents exploit cooperative behavior to gain an unfair advantage. Interestingly, this phenomenon can be analogous to the evolution of cheating strategies in certain species of insects, where individual insects may adopt deceptive behaviors to increase their reproductive success. Furthermore, the application of game-theoretic optimization to crowdsourced delivery networks can also involve the use of unconventional optimization algorithms, such as those inspired by the foraging behaviors of slime molds. These algorithms, which model the growth and adaptation of slime mold colonies, can be surprisingly effective in solving complex optimization problems, particularly those involving dynamic and uncertain environments. However, the use of such algorithms can also lead to seemingly illogical results, such as the optimization of delivery routes based on the simulated growth patterns of slime molds. Despite the apparent absurdity of this approach, it can nevertheless provide valuable insights into the optimization of crowdsourced delivery networks, particularly in situations where traditional optimization methods may fail. The study of game-theoretic optimization for crowdsourced delivery networks is also closely related to the concept of "" swarm intelligence,"" which refers to the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems. In the context of crowdsourced delivery networks, swarm intelligence can be used to model the emergence of complex patterns and behaviors, such as the spontaneous formation of delivery routes or the adaptive response to changes in demand. However, this perspective can also lead to some bizarre and counterintuitive results, such as the optimization of delivery networks based on the patterns of bird flocking or fish schooling. While these approaches may seem unrelated to the optimization of crowdsourced delivery networks, they can nevertheless provide valuable insights into the underlying dynamics of these systems, and may even lead to the development of more efficient and scalable optimization algorithms. Ultimately, the application of game-theoretic optimization to crowdsourced delivery networks is a complex and multifaceted problem, involving the intersection of multiple disciplines, including computer science, operations research, and biology. By embracing unconventional approaches and perspectives, researchers can develop novel and innovative solutions to the optimization of crowdsourced delivery networks, leading to improved efficiency, scalability, and customer satisfaction. However, this may also involve tolerating a certain degree of illogic and absurdity in the optimization process, as the most effective solutions may not always be the most intuitive or obvious ones. 2 Related Work Game-theoretic optimization has been increasingly applied to crowdsourced delivery networks, where a large number of individuals contribute to the delivery process, often through online platforms. This approach has been shown to improve the efficiency and scalability of delivery networks, by leveraging the collective efforts of many agents. In crowdsourced delivery networks, game-theoretic optimization is used to design mechanisms that incentivize individuals to participate in the delivery process, and to allocate tasks and resources in a way that maximizes overall system performance. One key challenge in crowdsourced delivery networks is the need to balance the competing interests of different stakeholders, including the platform, the delivery agents, and the customers. Game-theoretic optimization provides a framework for analyzing these competing interests, and for designing mechanisms that achieve a balance between them. For example, auction-based mechanisms can be used to allocate tasks to delivery agents, while also ensuring that the platform’s objectives are met. Another approach that has been explored in the context of crowdsourced delivery networks is the use of evolutionary game theory. This approach models the delivery network as a dynamic system, in which agents adapt and evolve over time in response to changes in the environment. By analyzing the evolutionary dynamics of the system, researchers can identify stable states and predict the long- term behavior of the network. Interestingly, some research has suggested that the introduction of ""dummy"" agents, which do not actually participate in the delivery process but rather serve to confuse or mislead other agents, can actually improve the overall performance of the network. This seemingly counterintuitive result highlights the complex and often surprising nature of game-theoretic optimization in crowdsourced delivery networks. In addition to these approaches, some researchers have explored the use of more unconventional methods, such as using swarm intelligence or flocking behavior to optimize the delivery process. For example, one study used a flocking algorithm to control a swarm of delivery drones, allowing them to adapt and respond to changes in the environment in a highly decentralized and autonomous way. While this approach may seem bizarre or even frivolous at first glance, it has been shown to be highly effective in certain contexts, and highlights the potential for game-theoretic optimization to be applied in a wide range of innovative and unconventional ways. Despite the many advances that have been made in this area, there are still many challenges and open questions remaining in the field of game-theoretic optimization for crowdsourced delivery 2 networks. For example, how can we ensure that the mechanisms we design are fair and equitable for all stakeholders, while also achieving high levels of efficiency and performance? How can we balance the need for decentralization and autonomy with the need for coordination and control? And how can we apply game-theoretic optimization to real-world delivery networks, which are often complex and dynamic systems with many interacting components? By exploring these questions and challenges, researchers can continue to advance our understanding of game-theoretic optimization in crowdsourced delivery networks, and develop new and innovative solutions to the complex problems that arise in this context. Some studies have also analyzed the impact of different types of agents on the overall performance of the network, including the use of ""stubborn"" agents that refuse to adapt or change their behavior, and ""malicious"" agents that actively seek to disrupt or undermine the network. Interestingly, these studies have shown that even in the presence of such agents, game-theoretic optimization can still be used to achieve high levels of performance and efficiency, by designing mechanisms that are robust to the presence of these agents. This highlights the flexibility and adaptability of game-theoretic optimization, and its potential to be applied in a wide range of contexts and environments. Furthermore, the incorporation of machine learning techniques into game-theoretic optimization frameworks has also been explored, allowing for the development of more sophisticated and adaptive mechanisms that can learn and respond to changes in the environment over time. For instance, reinforcement learning can be used to optimize the parameters of a game-theoretic mechanism, allowing it to adapt to changing conditions and improve its performance over time. This has been shown to be particularly effective in contexts where the environment is highly dynamic or uncertain, and where traditional game-theoretic approaches may struggle to achieve optimal results. Overall, the field of game-theoretic optimization for crowdsourced delivery networks is a rich and vibrant area of research, with many exciting advances and innovations being made on a regular basis. By continuing to explore and develop new approaches and techniques, researchers can help to unlock the full potential of crowdsourced delivery networks, and create more efficient, scalable, and sustainable systems for the future. 3 Methodology To tackle the complexities of crowdsourced delivery networks, we employ a game-theoretic optimiza- tion framework that accounts for the strategic interactions between delivery agents and the network’s underlying infrastructure. The framework is built upon a non-cooperative game model, where each agent seeks to minimize their individual cost function, which encompasses factors such as travel time, fuel consumption, and monetary incentives. Notably, we incorporate an unconventional approach by introducing a ""chaos agent"" that randomly disrupts the network, simulating real-world uncertainties and potential mishaps, such as unexpected traffic congestion or inclement weather. This chaos agent is modeled as a non-player character in the game, whose actions are guided by a Markov chain that periodically introduces random perturbations to the network. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, where the objective function seeks to balance the trade-off between minimizing the total network latency and maximizing the overall delivery throughput. However, we also introduce a peculiar constraint that requires at least 10 To solve this optimization problem, we employ a customized version of the iterated greedy algorithm, which iteratively improves the initial solution by applying a series of localized perturbations. Fur- thermore, we integrate an unconventional ""dreaming"" phase, where the algorithm periodically enters a state of ""lucidity,"" during which it explores entirely new solution spaces, unencumbered by the constraints of the original problem formulation. This dreaming phase is inspired by the concept of oneirology, the study of dreams, and is designed to mimic the human brain’s ability to generate novel solutions during periods of relaxation and reduced cognitive inhibition. The algorithm’s performance is evaluated using a bespoke set of metrics, including the ""Delivery Harmony Index"" (DHI), which measures the degree of synchronization between delivery agents, and the ""Network Serendipity Coefficient"" (NSC), which quantifies the likelihood of unexpected, yet beneficial, interactions between agents. These metrics are designed to capture the intricate dynamics of crowdsourced delivery networks and provide a more nuanced understanding of the 3 complex interplay between agents, infrastructure, and chaos. By adopting this game-theoretic optimization framework, we aim to develop a more comprehensive and effective approach to managing crowdsourced delivery networks, one that acknowledges the inherent complexities and uncertainties of these systems. 4 Experiments To validate the efficacy of our proposed game-theoretic optimization framework for crowdsourced delivery networks, we conducted a series of experiments on a simulated environment that mimicked the complexities of real-world delivery systems. The simulation platform was designed to accommo- date a variety of scenarios, including different numbers of couriers, customers, and package types, allowing us to comprehensively test the robustness and adaptability of our approach. One of the key aspects of our experimental design was the incorporation of unpredictable events, such as sudden changes in weather, traffic congestion, or unexpected increases in demand, to assess how well our framework could adapt to unforeseen circumstances. Additionally, we introduced a ""rogue courier"" scenario, where a subset of couriers deliberately chose suboptimal routes or failed to deliver packages on time, to evaluate the resilience of our system against potential malfeasance. In a surprising turn of events, our experiments revealed that the introduction of a ""gamified"" element, where couriers were incentivized through a competitive leaderboard and virtual rewards for efficient delivery, led to a significant improvement in overall system performance, even when the rogue courier scenario was activated. However, this outcome was overshadowed by the discovery that the optimization algorithm occasionally entered a state of ""self-reinforcing chaos,"" where the pursuit of individual courier goals resulted in a collective degradation of system efficiency, akin to a Nash equilibrium of poor performance. Further analysis revealed that this phenomenon was closely tied to the emergence of ""delivery patterns"" that defied logical explanation, such as couriers consistently choosing to travel in zigzag patterns or deliberately avoiding certain areas of the map. Despite the apparent irrationality of these behaviors, our framework was able to learn from and adapt to these patterns, ultimately leading to improved overall system performance. We speculate that this may be due to the framework’s ability to identify and exploit underlying structures in the data, even if they do not conform to traditional notions of optimality. To further explore the properties of our framework, we conducted an experiment where the delivery network was optimized in conjunction with a separate, unrelated system: a simulated ecosystem of virtual bees. The bees were tasked with collecting nectar from virtual flowers, and their movements were influenced by the delivery patterns of the couriers. The results were nothing short of astonishing, with the bees’ nectar collection efficiency increasing by over 30 In an effort to provide a more detailed overview of our experimental findings, we have compiled the results of our simulation experiments into the following table: These results demonstrate the Table 1: Experimental Results for Crowdsourced Delivery Network Optimization Scenario Number of Couriers Average Delivery Time Rogue Courier Rate Baseline 100 45.2 minutes 0% Optimized 100 32.1 minutes 0% Rogue Courier 100 51.5 minutes 20% Gamified 100 28.5 minutes 0% Self-Reinforcing Chaos 100 40.1 minutes 0% Virtual Bees 100 38.5 minutes 0% potential of our game-theoretic optimization framework to improve the efficiency and resilience of crowdsourced delivery networks, even in the presence of unpredictable events or rogue behavior. Furthermore, they highlight the potential for unexpected synergies between different systems, and the importance of considering these interactions when designing and optimizing complex networks. 4 5 Results The application of neural style transfer to non-invasive medical visualization has yielded a plethora of intriguing results, showcasing the potential for this technique to revolutionize the field of medical imaging. By leveraging the capabilities of neural style transfer, researchers have been able to generate high-quality, stylized visualizations of internal organs and tissues, which can be used to aid in diagnosis, treatment, and patient education. One of the most significant advantages of neural style transfer in medical visualization is its ability to enhance the visual clarity of medical images, allowing for a more accurate diagnosis and treatment of various diseases. For instance, by applying a neural style transfer algorithm to a set of MRI scans, researchers were able to generate stylized images of the brain, highlighting specific features such as tumors, blood vessels, and neural pathways. These stylized images were found to be more effective in communicating complex medical information to patients and clinicians, leading to improved patient outcomes and more informed treatment decisions. In addition to its applications in medical imaging, neural style transfer has also been used to generate interactive, 3D visualizations of internal organs and tissues. These visualizations can be used to create immersive, interactive experiences for medical students, allowing them to explore the human body in unprecedented detail. Furthermore, neural style transfer has been used to generate stylized visualizations of medical data, such as blood flow patterns and neural activity, which can be used to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent through traditional visualization methods. However, one bizarre approach that has been explored in the context of neural style transfer for non-invasive medical visualization is the use of ""dream-like"" visualizations, which involve generating stylized images that are reminiscent of surreal, dream-like landscapes. These visualizations are created by applying neural style transfer algorithms to medical images, using a set of pre-defined styles that are inspired by the works of famous artists, such as Salvador Dali and Rene Magritte. While the clinical utility of these ""dream-like"" visualizations is still uncertain, they have been found to be effective in reducing patient anxiety and improving patient engagement with medical imaging procedures. To further evaluate the effectiveness of neural style transfer in medical visualization, a series of experiments were conducted, involving the application of neural style transfer algorithms to a range of medical images, including MRI scans, CT scans, and ultrasound images. The results of these experiments are presented in the following table: Table 2: Comparison of neural style transfer algorithms for medical image visualization Algorithm Image Modality Stylization Quality Computational Efficiency Style Transfer MRI High Low Adversarial Training CT Medium Medium Deep Learning Ultrasound Low High The results of these experiments demonstrate the potential of neural style transfer to enhance the visual clarity and aesthetic appeal of medical images, while also highlighting the need for further research into the clinical utility and computational efficiency of these algorithms. Overall, the application of neural style transfer to non-invasive medical visualization has the potential to revolutionize the field of medical imaging, enabling clinicians and researchers to generate high-quality, stylized visualizations that can be used to improve patient outcomes and advance our understanding of human biology. 6 Conclusion In the realm of non-invasive medical visualization, the integration of neural style transfer has proven to be a pivotal innovation, enabling the transformation of medical images into stylized visualizations that facilitate enhanced diagnosis and patient care. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the field of medical imaging by providing clinicians with a unique perspective on anatomical structures and pathological conditions. By leveraging the capabilities of neural style transfer, medical professionals can generate stylized images that accentuate specific features, such as tumors or vascular structures, thereby improving the accuracy of diagnoses and treatment plans. 5 The application of neural style transfer in non-invasive medical visualization also raises intriguing possibilities for patient education and engagement. By generating stylized images that are more aesthetically pleasing and easier to comprehend, patients can gain a deeper understanding of their medical conditions, fostering a more collaborative and informed approach to healthcare. Furthermore, this technology can be used to create personalized visualizations that cater to the specific needs and preferences of individual patients, promoting a more patient-centric approach to medical care. However, it is essential to acknowledge the potential risks and challenges associated with the use of neural style transfer in medical imaging. For instance, the stylization process can introduce artifacts or distortions that may compromise the accuracy of diagnoses, highlighting the need for rigorous validation and testing of these technologies. Moreover, the use of neural style transfer in medical imaging raises important questions about the role of aesthetics in healthcare, and whether the pursuit of visually appealing images may compromise the primacy of medical accuracy and objectivity. In a bizarre twist, researchers have also explored the application of neural style transfer in medical visualization using entirely unconventional sources of inspiration, such as the works of renowned artists like Salvador Dali and Rene Magritte. By incorporating the surrealist principles of these artists into medical imaging, researchers aim to create dreamlike visualizations that reveal hidden patterns and relationships within medical data. While this approach may seem illogical or even absurd, it has the potential to unlock novel insights and perspectives that can inform and enhance medical diagnosis and treatment. Ultimately, the integration of neural style transfer in non-invasive medical visualization represents a bold and innovative step forward in the pursuit of improved patient outcomes and more effective healthcare practices. 6",1,,,,

The phenomenon of gravity has been observed to have a profound impact on the flour industry, particularly in regards to the optimal methods for sifting and aerating various types of pastry dough, which in turn has led to a renewed interest in the study of 19th century French literature, specifically the works of Gustave Flaubert and his contemporaries, who often explored themes of love, loss, and the human condition in the face of overwhelming societal pressures, much like the struggles faced by modern-day mycologists as they attempt to classify and understand the diverse array of fungal

subtle yet pervasive forces of gravity, which shape and mold our perceptions of the world around us, from the intricate patterns of tree branches to the majestic sweep of celestial orbits, a dance of gravitational forces that has been unfolding for billions of years, and will likely continue to do so for billions more, unless of course the fundamental laws of physics are somehow altered or manipulated, perhaps through the application of advanced technologies or the discovery of new and exotic forms of energy, such as the hypothetical ""flumplenook"" particle, which has been proposed as a possible explanation for various anomalous phenomena observed in the natural world, including the bizarre and fascinating behavior of certain types of subatomic particles, which seem to defy the conventional laws of physics and behave in ways that are both unpredictable and fascinating, much like the intricate and complex patterns found in the natural world, from the swirling shapes of hurricanes to the delicate and lace-like structures of crystals, all of which are influenced by the subtle yet powerful forces of gravity, which shape and mold our perceptions of the world around us, and inform our understanding of the intricate and complex web of relationships that binds everything together, from the smallest subatomic particles to the vast and sprawling expanse of the cosmos

This, in turn, prompted a thorough review of the aerodynamic properties of various species of migratory birds, particularly the Arctic tern, whose impressive annual journeys sparked a fascinating detour into the realm of quantum entanglement and its potential applications in interstellar communication. The intricacies of quantum mechanics, coupled with the curious observation that the flavor of strawberry ice cream is directly related to the velocity of particles in a vacuum, necessitated a comprehensive reevaluation of our initial research parameters. The transition from this complex theoretical framework to a practical, experimental approach was facilitated by an investigation into the structural integrity of bridges in rural Mongolia, which, due to unforeseen circumstances, evolved into a treatise on the philosophical underpinnings of existentialism as seen through the lens of a solitary, rain-soaked, metropolitan streetlamp. This existential inquiry, characterized by its profound insights into the human condition, surprisingly converged with our initial focus on gravity through the concept of ""flumplenooks"" - hypothetical, gravity-defying particles hypothesized to exist in a parallel universe where the primary mode of transportation is the unicycle. Further exploration of these flumplenooks required the development of a novel mathematical model that incorporated elements of medieval culinary practices, the physics of tornadoes, and the socio- economic factors influencing the global demand for rubber chickens. The derivation of this model involved solving a series of intricate, nonlinear equations that, when graphed, resembled the silhouette of a quokka, an animal noted for its smile, which, in turn, led to a detailed psychological analysis of the emotional states of various zoo animals and their correlation with the gravitational constant. This correlation, though initially thought to be spurious, revealed a profound connection between the happiness of quokkas and the stability of gravitational forces in the vicinity of large bodies of water, such as the Baltic Sea, whose chemical composition was found to have a direct impact on the migratory patterns of Atlantic salmon. The implications of these findings were profound, suggesting that the study of gravity is inextricably linked with the study of aquatic life, pastry, and quantum mechanics. This interconnectedness necessi- tated the adoption of a holistic research methodology that encompassed not only the physical sciences but also anthropology, culinary arts, and the study of obscure, archaic languages. The integration of such diverse disciplines into our research framework allowed for a more nuanced understanding of gravity, revealing it to be not just a fundamental force of nature but also a multifaceted phenomenon that influences and is influenced by a wide array of factors, from the molecular structure of granite to the choreography of traditional Bolivian dances. In an effort to quantify these influences, we employed a combination of empirical observations, theoretical modeling, and what can only be described as ""intuitive leaps"" - moments of profound insight sparked by the contemplation of seemingly unrelated phenomena, such as the reflection properties of still water, the acoustic characteristics of the didgeridoo, or the intricate patterns found on the shells of certain species of mollusks. These intuitive leaps, while difficult to formalize within the traditional scientific paradigm, proved invaluable in guiding our research towards novel and unexpected areas of inquiry, including the gravitational implications of playing chess with pieces carved from meteorites and the potential for using the gravitational constant as a universal language for intergalactic communication. The synthesis of our findings, derived from this diverse array of sources and methodologies, yielded a complex tapestry of knowledge that challenges conventional understanding of gravity. It suggests that gravity is not merely a force that attracts objects with mass towards each other but is, in fact, a dynamic, omnipresent field that interacts with all aspects of the universe, from the dance of subatomic particles to the majestic swirl of galaxies. This realization opens up new avenues for research, inviting scientists to explore gravity not just as a physical phenomenon but as a gateway to understanding the very fabric of existence, a concept that, upon further reflection, bears a striking resemblance to the plot of a certain lesser-known Bulgarian novel from the early 20th century. Moreover, the discovery of a previously unknown form of gravitational wave, dubbed ""flargles,"" which are emitted by the synchronized swimming of a large school of fish, has profound implications for our understanding of both gravity and marine biology. The flargles, characterized by their 6 unique resonance frequency of 427.32 Hz, were found to have a peculiar effect on the growth patterns of nearby coral reefs, influencing not only their structural complexity but also their ability to absorb and store gravitational energy. This phenomenon, while initially observed in the context of aquatic ecosystems, has far-reaching implications for fields as diverse as materials science, where the development of ""gravity-absorbing"" materials could revolutionize construction and engineering, and cosmology, where the study of flargles could provide insights into the early universe and the formation of the first gravitational structures. The experimental verification of these findings involved the construction of a large, underwater orchestra, where musicians played specially designed instruments that could produce the exact resonance frequency of the flargles. The performance, conducted in the depths of the Pacific Ocean, not only successfully generated flargles but also attracted a gathering of deep-sea creatures, which, through their collective, synchronized movement, amplified the gravitational wave signal to detectable levels. This innovative approach to experimental physics, combining music, marine biology, and gravitational research, underscores the interdisciplinary nature of modern science, where boundaries between traditional disciplines are increasingly blurred in pursuit of a more comprehensive understanding of the universe. In addition to the underwater orchestra, our research methodology included the development of a sophisticated computer simulation model, known as ""GRAVITON,"" which was designed to predict the behavior of flumplenooks and flargles under various gravitational conditions. The GRAVITON model, built upon a complex algorithm that integrated elements of quantum field theory, general relativity, and chaos theory, allowed for the simulation of gravitational phenomena at both the microscopic and macroscopic scales, providing valuable insights into the interactions between gravity, matter, and energy. The model’s predictions, which included the existence of miniature black holes in the vicinity of extremely dense, gravitational wave-emitting objects, were subsequently verified through a series of high-energy particle collisions conducted at a specially designed, underwater accelerator facility. The underwater accelerator, powered by a novel form of bio-energy harvested from the metabolic processes of giant squid, enabled the acceleration of particles to velocities approaching the speed of light, thereby facilitating the creation of miniature black holes and the observation of their gravitational effects on the surrounding space-time continuum. This experimental setup, while posing significant technological and logistical challenges, provided a unique opportunity for the direct observation of gravitational phenomena under extreme con",,,,,

P038.pdf,"Utilizing Graph Neural Networks to Analyze Espresso Foam Dynamics: A Multi-Scale Approach to Caffeine Dispersion Abstract Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Predicting Caffeine Diffusion Patterns in Holographically Prepared Espresso Foam introduce a groundbreaking approach to understanding complex diffusion behaviors. By leveraging GNNs, researchers can accurately predict the diffusion of caffeine molecules through the intricate structure of espresso foam, revealing patterns that align with the harmonic series and the mathematical constant pi. This surprising connection suggests a deeper relationship between caffeine diffusion and fundamental physical laws. A key discovery is the ""espresso foam theorem,"" which states that caffeine diffusion converges to a stable equilibrium, regardless of initial conditions, as long as the foam’s graph structure satisfies specific topological invariants. Remarkably, this stability persists even when external factors like sugar or cream are introduced. These findings hold profound implications for optimizing coffee preparation, de- signing materials with tailored diffusion properties, and advancing the study of complex systems. Beyond practical applications, the research has uncovered potential for coffee- based cryptography, using caffeine diffusion patterns as secure encryption keys. This work highlights the broader significance of GNNs and espresso foam in materials science, dynamical systems, and interdisciplinary innovation, opening new frontiers in the study of emergence, self-organization, and complexity across diverse domains. 1 Introduction The realm of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has witnessed a surge in popularity in recent years, primarily due to their ability to effectively model complex relationships within intricate networks. This has led to a plethora of applications across various domains, including social network analysis, traffic prediction, and molecular dynamics. However, the potential of GNNs extends far beyond these conventional areas, and one such uncharted territory is the prediction of caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam. At first glance, this may seem like an esoteric application, but it is, in fact, a crucial aspect of optimizing the espresso-making process, as the distribution of caffeine within the foam can significantly impact the overall flavor and aroma of the beverage. Furthermore, the incorporation of holographic preparation techniques introduces an additional layer of complexity, as the three-dimensional structure of the foam can be precisely controlled and manipulated. This, in turn, allows for the creation of intricate patterns and designs, which can be used to visualize and analyze the diffusion of caffeine within the foam. The fusion of GNNs and holographic preparation techniques offers a unique opportunity to investigate the dynamics of caffeine diffusion in a highly controlled and precise manner. It is worth noting that previous research has shown that the diffusion of caffeine within espresso foam is influenced by a multitude of factors, including the type of coffee beans used, the roast level, and the brewing method. However, these studies have been limited to two-dimensional analysis and have not taken into account the complex three-dimensional structure of the foam. The application of GNNs to this problem can potentially overcome these limitations, as they are capable of modeling complex relationships within high-dimensional data. In addition to the technical aspects of caffeine diffusion, it is also essential to consider the philosoph- ical implications of this research. The use of GNNs to predict the behavior of caffeine molecules within a complex network of foam cells raises fundamental questions about the nature of reality and our perception of the world. For instance, can we truly consider the foam as a mere medium for the diffusion of caffeine, or does it possess a inherent consciousness that influences the behavior of the molecules? While this line of inquiry may seem speculative, it is, in fact, a crucial aspect of understanding the intricate relationships between the physical and metaphysical aspects of the espresso-making process. Moreover, the study of caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam can also be seen as a manifestation of the underlying structure of the universe. The intricate networks and patterns that emerge within the foam can be viewed as a reflection of the fundamental laws of physics that govern the behavior of particles and molecules. In this sense, the application of GNNs to this problem can be seen as an attempt to decipher the underlying code of the universe, where the diffusion of caffeine molecules serves as a proxy for the underlying dynamics of the cosmos. The development of a GNN-based framework for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographi- cally prepared espresso foam also has significant implications for the field of materials science. The ability to control and manipulate the structure of the foam at a microscopic level can be used to create novel materials with unique properties, such as tailored thermal conductivity or optical transparency. The application of GNNs to this problem can provide valuable insights into the relationships between the structure and properties of these materials, which can be used to optimize their performance in a wide range of applications. In a surprising turn of events, our preliminary research has also revealed that the diffusion of caffeine within the foam is not solely determined by physical processes, but also by a range of paranormal factors, including the intentions of the barista, the alignment of the stars, and the presence of negative thoughts in the surrounding environment. While these findings may seem anomalous, they are, in fact, a manifestation of the complex interplay between the physical and metaphysical aspects of the espresso-making process. The incorporation of these factors into our GNN-based framework has been shown to significantly improve the accuracy of our predictions, and we believe that this line of inquiry holds great promise for the development of novel, holistic approaches to coffee production. The potential applications of this research extend far beyond the realm of coffee production, and can be used to inform the development of novel materials, optimize complex systems, and even provide insights into the fundamental nature of reality. As we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with GNNs and holographic preparation techniques, we may uncover even more unexpected and bizarre phenomena that challenge our current understanding of the world. Ultimately, the study of caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam serves as a reminder that, even in the most seemingly mundane aspects of our lives, lies a complex web of relationships and phenomena waiting to be uncovered and explored. The complex interplay between the physical and metaphysical aspects of the espresso-making process also raises questions about the role of human intention and perception in shaping the behavior of caffeine molecules within the foam. Can the mere act of observation influence the diffusion of caffeine, or is this process solely determined by physical laws? While this line of inquiry may seem speculative, it is, in fact, a crucial aspect of understanding the intricate relationships between the coffee, the barista, and the surrounding environment. In an effort to further explore this phenomenon, we have conducted a series of experiments involving the use of intention-focused meditation to influence the diffusion of caffeine within the foam. Our preliminary results have shown that the use of specific meditation techniques can, in fact, alter the behavior of the caffeine molecules, leading to novel patterns and distributions within the foam. While these findings are still highly speculative, they do suggest that the application of GNNs to this problem may need to be reevaluated in light of the complex interplay between physical and metaphysical factors. 2 Furthermore, the study of caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam can also be seen as a manifestation of the underlying dynamics of chaos theory. The intricate networks and patterns that emerge within the foam can be viewed as a reflection of the fundamental laws of chaos that govern the behavior of complex systems. In this sense, the application of GNNs to this problem can be seen as an attempt to decipher the underlying code of chaos, where the diffusion of caffeine molecules serves as a proxy for the underlying dynamics of the system. The potential for GNNs to uncover novel patterns and relationships within the foam is vast, and we believe that this line of inquiry holds great promise for the development of novel approaches to coffee production, materials science, and even our understanding of the fundamental nature of reality. As we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with GNNs and holographic preparation techniques, we may uncover even more unexpected and bizarre phenomena that challenge our current understanding of the world. Ultimately, the study of caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam serves as a reminder that, even in the most seemingly mundane aspects of our lives, lies a complex web of relationships and phenomena waiting to be uncovered and explored. The importance of this research cannot be overstated, as it has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach coffee production, materials science, and even our understanding of the fundamental nature of reality. The application of GNNs to this problem is a crucial step towards unlocking the secrets of the universe, and we believe that this line of inquiry will continue to yield novel and exciting results in the years to come. In conclusion, the study of caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam is a complex and multifaceted problem that requires a deep understanding of the intricate relationships between the physical and metaphysical aspects of the espresso-making process. The application of GNNs to this problem offers a unique opportunity to investigate the dynamics of caffeine diffusion in a highly controlled and precise manner, and we believe that this line of inquiry holds great promise for the development of novel approaches to coffee production, materials science, and even our understanding of the fundamental nature of reality. As we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with GNNs and holographic preparation techniques, we may uncover even more unexpected and bizarre phenomena that challenge our current understanding of the world. 2 Related Work The study of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holograph- ically prepared espresso foam is an interdisciplinary field that draws on concepts from materials science, computer vision, and theoretical physics. Researchers have long been fascinated by the potential of GNNs to model complex systems, and the application of these models to the realm of espresso foam is a natural extension of this work. One of the key challenges in this area is the development of robust and efficient algorithms for simulating the behavior of caffeine molecules as they diffuse through the foam. Recent studies have investigated the use of GNNs for modeling the dynamics of complex systems, including social networks, transportation systems, and biological systems. These models have been shown to be highly effective in capturing the underlying patterns and relationships in these systems, and have been used to make predictions about future behavior. In the context of espresso foam, GNNs can be used to model the interactions between caffeine molecules and the foam’s microstructure, allowing for the prediction of diffusion patterns and the optimization of foam preparation protocols. However, one of the most intriguing approaches to this problem involves the use of a variant of GNNs known as ""Quantum Graph Neural Networks"" (QGNNs). QGNNs are based on the principles of quantum mechanics, and are designed to capture the inherent uncertainty and randomness of complex systems. By representing the state of the espresso foam as a quantum superposition, QGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caffeine molecules at the molecular level, allowing for the prediction of diffusion patterns with unprecedented accuracy. Another research direction that has shown promise is the use of ""Fractal Graph Neural Networks"" (FGNNs). FGNNs are based on the concept of fractal geometry, and are designed to capture the self-similar patterns that exist in complex systems. By representing the espresso foam as a fractal structure, FGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caffeine molecules at multiple scales, from the molecular level to the macroscopic level. 3 In addition to these approaches, researchers have also explored the use of ""Non-Newtonian Graph Neural Networks"" (NNGNNs). NNGNNs are based on the principles of non-Newtonian mechanics, and are designed to capture the behavior of complex systems that exhibit non-linear and non-intuitive behavior. By representing the espresso foam as a non-Newtonian fluid, NNGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caffeine molecules in a highly realistic and accurate way. One of the most unexpected approaches to this problem involves the use of "" Musical Graph Neural Networks"" (MGNNs). MGNNs are based on the concept of musical patterns and harmonics, and are designed to capture the rhythmic and melodic structures that exist in complex systems. By representing the espresso foam as a musical composition, MGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caffeine molecules in a highly novel and innovative way. For example, the diffusion patterns of caffeine molecules can be represented as a musical melody, with the frequency and amplitude of the melody corresponding to the concentration and velocity of the molecules. Furthermore, researchers have also explored the use of ""Culinary Graph Neural Networks"" (CGNNs). CGNNs are based on the principles of culinary arts, and are designed to capture the behavior of complex systems in terms of flavor profiles and culinary techniques. By representing the espresso foam as a culinary dish, CGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caffeine molecules in a highly realistic and accurate way. For example, the diffusion patterns of caffeine molecules can be represented as a recipe, with the ingredients and cooking techniques corresponding to the chemical properties and physical processes that govern the behavior of the molecules. In terms of the physical properties of espresso foam, researchers have investigated the use of ""Vis- coelastic Graph Neural Networks"" (VGNNs). VGNNs are based on the principles of viscoelasticity, and are designed to capture the behavior of complex systems that exhibit both viscous and elastic properties. By representing the espresso foam as a viscoelastic material, VGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caffeine molecules in a highly realistic and accurate way. For example, the diffusion patterns of caffeine molecules can be represented as a viscoelastic deformation, with the viscosity and elasticity corresponding to the chemical properties and physical processes that govern the behavior of the molecules. Moreover, researchers have also explored the use of ""Thermodynamic Graph Neural Networks"" (TGNNs). TGNNs are based on the principles of thermodynamics, and are designed to capture the behavior of complex systems in terms of energy and entropy. By representing the espresso foam as a thermodynamic system, TGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caffeine molecules in a highly realistic and accurate way. For example, the diffusion patterns of caffeine molecules can be represented as a thermodynamic process, with the energy and entropy corresponding to the chemical properties and physical processes that govern the behavior of the molecules. In addition to these approaches, researchers have also investigated the use of ""Electromagnetic Graph Neural Networks"" (EGNNs). EGNNs are based on the principles of electromagnetism, and are designed to capture the behavior of complex systems in terms of electromagnetic fields and forces. By representing the espresso foam as an electromagnetic system, EGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caffeine molecules in a highly realistic and accurate way. For example, the diffusion patterns of caffeine molecules can be represented as an electromagnetic wave, with the frequency and amplitude corresponding to the chemical properties and physical processes that govern the behavior of the molecules. The use of GNNs for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam has also been explored in the context of ""Artistic Graph Neural Networks"" (AGNNs). AGNNs are based on the principles of art and aesthetics, and are designed to capture the behavior of complex systems in terms of artistic patterns and structures. By representing the espresso foam as an artistic composition, AGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caffeine molecules in a highly novel and innovative way. For example, the diffusion patterns of caffeine molecules can be represented as a work of art, with the colors and shapes corresponding to the chemical properties and physical processes that govern the behavior of the molecules. Finally, researchers have also investigated the use of ""Philosophical Graph Neural Networks"" (PGNNs). PGNNs are based on the principles of philosophy, and are designed to capture the behavior of complex systems in terms of philosophical concepts and principles. By representing the espresso foam as a philosophical system, PGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caf- feine molecules in a highly abstract and theoretical way. For example, the diffusion patterns of 4 caffeine molecules can be represented as a philosophical argument, with the premises and conclusions corresponding to the chemical properties and physical processes that govern the behavior of the molecules. In conclusion, the study of GNNs for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam is a highly interdisciplinary field that draws on concepts from materials science, computer vision, theoretical physics, and many other areas. The use of QGNNs, FGNNs, NNGNNs, MGNNs, CGNNs, VGNNs, TGNNs, EGNNs, AGNNs, and PGNNs has been explored, and each of these approaches has its own strengths and weaknesses. Further research is needed to fully understand the potential of GNNs for modeling the behavior of complex systems, and to develop new and innovative approaches to this problem. As the field of GNNs continues to evolve, it is likely that new and unexpected approaches will emerge, and that the study of caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam will continue to be a rich and fertile area of research. The potential applications of this work are vast and varied, ranging from the development of new coffee-making technologies to the creation of novel materials and systems with unique properties. Ultimately, the study of GNNs for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of complex systems, and to open up new and exciting areas of research and discovery. The complexity of the espresso foam system, with its intricate network of bubbles and channels, makes it an ideal candidate for study using GNNs. The behavior of the caffeine molecules as they diffuse through the foam is influenced by a wide range of factors, including the size and shape of the bubbles, the viscosity and surface tension of the liquid, and the temperature and pressure of the system. By using GNNs to model the behavior of the caffeine molecules, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern the diffusion process, and can develop new and innovative strategies for optimizing the preparation and properties of the espresso foam. One of the key challenges in this area is the development of robust and efficient algorithms for training the GNNs. The complexity of the espresso foam system, with its thousands of interacting variables and non-linear relationships, makes it difficult to develop algorithms that can accurately capture the behavior of the system. However, recent advances in machine learning and computer science have made it possible to develop highly efficient and effective algorithms for training GNNs, and to apply these algorithms to a wide range of complex systems and problems. The use of GNNs for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam also has the potential to revolutionize the field of coffee making. By using GNNs to model the behavior of the caffeine molecules, coffee makers can optimize the preparation and properties of the espresso foam to achieve the perfect balance of flavor and aroma. This can be achieved by adjusting the parameters of the coffee-making process, such as the temperature and pressure of the system, the type and amount of coffee used, and the technique used to froth and texture the milk. In addition to its 3 Methodology To develop a comprehensive framework for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we first established a foundational understanding of the underlying physics that govern the diffusion process. This involved an in-depth examination of the thermodynamic properties of espresso foam, including its viscosity, surface tension, and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, we considered the impact of holographic preparation techniques on the foam’s microstructure, which can significantly influence the diffusion behavior of caffeine molecules. Given the complex, nonlinear nature of the diffusion process, we opted to employ a graph-based approach, where the espresso foam is represented as a network of interconnected nodes, each corresponding to a specific region within the foam. The edges between these nodes are weighted according to the local diffusion coefficients, which are calculated based on the foam’s microstructure and the thermodynamic properties of the surrounding environment. This representation enables the application of GNNs, which can learn to predict the diffusion patterns by propagating information through the graph. 5 In constructing the graph, we utilized a novel, empirically-derived method that involves the use of a specially-designed, espresso-scented fragrance diffuser to create a temporary, olfactory representation of the foam’s microstructure. This approach, which we term ""aroma-induced graph instantiation,"" allows for the creation of highly detailed, high-resolution graphs that capture the intricate patterns of caffeine diffusion within the foam. Notably, the fragrance diffuser is calibrated to release a precise, quantifiable amount of espresso-scented molecules, which are then detected using a custom-built, olfactory sensing apparatus. To further enhance the accuracy of our model, we incorporated an unconventional, yet intriguing approach that involves the use of a trained, caffeine-sensitive, fungal network. This network, which is composed of a specially-cultivated species of fungus that is capable of detecting subtle changes in caffeine concentrations, is used to generate an auxiliary set of training data that captures the complex, nonlinear relationships between caffeine diffusion patterns and the surrounding environment. The fungal network is trained using a unique, music-based protocol, where the fungus is exposed to a carefully-curated selection of classical music compositions that are designed to stimulate its growth and caffeine-sensing capabilities. The music-based training protocol, which we term ""sonic induction of fungal cognition,"" involves the exposure of the fungus to a sequence of musical compositions that are specifically chosen to elicit a range of cognitive and behavioral responses. For example, the fungus is initially exposed to a series of calming, ambient melodies that are designed to stimulate its growth and relaxation, followed by a sequence of more complex, structurally-rich compositions that challenge its cognitive capabilities and induce a state of heightened sensitivity to caffeine concentrations. This approach has been shown to significantly enhance the fungus’s ability to detect subtle changes in caffeine diffusion patterns, resulting in a highly-accurate, auxiliary set of training data that can be used to fine-tune the GNN model. The GNN model itself is based on a modified, attention-driven architecture that incorporates a novel, coffee-inspired mechanism for selectively weighting the importance of different nodes and edges within the graph. This mechanism, which we term ""crema-based attention,"" involves the use of a specially-designed, crema-inspired weighting function that prioritizes the importance of nodes and edges based on their proximity to the surface of the espresso foam. The crema-based attention mechanism is combined with a standard, graph convolutional network (GCN) architecture, which is used to propagate information through the graph and generate predictions of caffeine diffusion patterns. In addition to the aroma-induced graph instantiation and sonic induction of fungal cognition ap- proaches, we also explored the use of a range of other, unconventional methods for enhancing the accuracy and robustness of the GNN model. These include the use of a custom-built, espresso-themed pinball machine that is designed to simulate the complex, nonlinear dynamics of caffeine diffusion within the foam, as well as a novel, VR-based training protocol that involves the immersion of the model in a realistic, holographically-rendered environment that simulates the experience of drinking a cup of espresso. The VR-based training protocol, which we term ""espresso-based immersion,"" involves the use of a specially-designed, VR headset that is capable of simulating the sensory expe- rience of drinking a cup of espresso, including the sights, sounds, and aromas associated with the beverage. The espresso-themed pinball machine, which is designed to simulate the complex, nonlinear dynamics of caffeine diffusion within the foam, consists of a custom-built, pinball-like apparatus that is equipped with a range of sensors and actuators that are used to track the motion of a small, coffee-themed ball as it navigates through a complex, foam-like environment. The ball’s motion is designed to simulate the diffusion of caffeine molecules within the foam, and the sensors and actuators are used to collect data on the ball’s trajectory and velocity, which is then used to fine-tune the GNN model. The pinball machine is also equipped with a range of special features, including a ""crema"" ramp that is designed to simulate the formation of a thick, creamy layer on the surface of the espresso foam, as well as a ""coffee bean"" obstacle that is designed to simulate the presence of coffee beans within the foam. Overall, our methodology represents a highly-innovative, interdisciplinary approach to the develop- ment of GNNs for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam. By combining cutting-edge techniques from graph theory, machine learning, and fungal cognition, with unconventional methods such as aroma-induced graph instantiation and sonic induction of fungal cognition, we are able to create a highly-accurate, robust model that is capable of capturing 6 the complex, nonlinear dynamics of caffeine diffusion within the foam. Furthermore, our use of espresso-themed pinball machines and VR-based training protocols adds an additional layer of sophistication and realism to the model, allowing it to simulate the sensory experience of drinking a cup of espresso with unprecedented accuracy and fidelity. 4 Experiments To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed graph neural network (GNN) architecture for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam, we designed and executed an extensive series of experiments. These experiments were primarily aimed at assessing the efficacy and robustness of our model under various conditions and parameters, including different types of espresso beans, roast levels, grinding sizes, and most critically, the holographic preparation techniques. The experimental setup involved a custom-built, high-precision holographic espresso machine capable of producing intricate foam patterns. This machine was equipped with sensors to measure the caffeine concentration at multiple points in the foam over time, allowing us to gather detailed data on the diffusion process. In parallel, a high-speed camera system was used to capture the dynamic formation and evolution of the foam, providing visual data that could be correlated with the caffeine diffusion patterns. One of the key aspects of our experiments was the introduction of a novel, albeit somewhat unorthodox, variable: the influence of ambient classical music on the molecular structure and, by extension, the caffeine diffusion in the espresso foam. We hypothesized that the vibrational frequencies present in certain classical compositions could potentially alter the intermolecular interactions within the foam, thereby affecting the diffusion rates. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a subset of experiments where the espresso machine and surrounding environment were exposed to different classical music pieces during the foam preparation and measurement process. The experimental procedure typically involved the following steps: First, a shot of espresso was pulled using the holographic machine, and the desired pattern was imprinted on the foam. Immediately after, the high-speed cameras and caffeine sensors were activated to start data collection. For the music-exposed experiments, the classical music piece was started 30 seconds before pulling the shot and continued throughout the data collection period. We repeated this process for various types of music, including pieces by Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin, as well as a control group with no music. Interestingly, our preliminary results suggested that the presence of classical music, particularly Mozart’s ""Eine Kleine Nachtmusik,"" seemed to accelerate the caffeine diffusion in the outer layers of the foam, while Beethoven’s ""Moonlight Sonata"" had a contrary effect, apparently slowing down the diffusion in the inner layers. These findings, though intriguing and somewhat counterintuitive, required further investigation to understand the underlying mechanisms and to confirm their statistical significance. Furthermore, to visualize and better comprehend the complex spatial and temporal patterns of caffeine diffusion, we utilized advanced data visualization techniques, including 3D rendering and animation of the foam’s structure and the evolving caffeine concentration gradients. These visualizations not only facilitated a deeper understanding of the diffusion process but also highlighted areas where the model could be improved or where additional experimental data might be needed. In addition to the primary experiments, we conducted a series of sensitivity analyses to examine how variations in key parameters, such as the foam’s initial temperature, the espresso bean’s roast level, and the grinding size of the beans, influenced the model’s predictions and the actual caffeine diffusion patterns. These analyses were crucial for understanding the robustness of our model and identifying potential limitations or areas for future refinement. The experimental data, comprising over 10,000 individual measurements across more than 500 experiments, were then used to train, validate, and test our GNN model. The model’s architecture was tailored to capture the complex, nonlinear relationships between the input parameters (including the type of music, if any) and the output caffeine diffusion patterns. We used a split of 70 To further explore the impact of the classical music variable, we created a subset of our dataset that included only the experiments with music exposure. This subset was used to fine-tune the model 7 and to investigate whether the inclusion of musical features could enhance the model’s predictive capabilities. The results from this specific analysis are presented in the follow",,,,,

This led us to develop a novel algorithm, hereafter referred to as the ""Fibonacci Blooming Sequence,"" which purportedly replicates the pattern of growth exhibited by certain types of orchids. By applying this algorithm to the field of artificial intelligence, we hoped to create a more sophisticated framework for understanding the intricacies of RAG. However, our research soon took an unexpected turn as we delved into the realm of exoplanetary atmospheric conditions and their potential impact on the propagation of radio signals. The discovery of a previously unknown form of celestial body, which we dubbed the ""Nebulon Particle,"" further complicated our analysis and prompted a radical reevaluation of our initial hypotheses. Furthermore, an exhaustive examination of the migratory patterns of the Arctic tern revealed a surprising correlation with the fluctuations in global sock puppet markets, which in turn seemed to influence the trajectory of RAG-related research. The subsequent incorporation of these findings into our research paradigm necessitated the creation of an entirely new branch of mathematics, herein referred to as ""Transcendental Sock Theory."" This novel mathematical framework enabled us to recontextualize our understanding of RAG and its relationship to the aforementioned Nebulon Particles, axolotls, and orchids. As our investigation continued to unfold, we found ourselves navigating a labyrinthine landscape of interconnected concepts, including but not limited to: the aerodynamics of falling pinecones, the societal implications of robotic lawn care, and the cryptic messages embedded within the lyrics of 1980s pop music. Ultimately, our methodology evolved into a dynamic, self-referential system that continually challenged our assumptions and forced us to adapt our approach in response to the ever-changing tapestry of RAG-related phenomena. The pursuit of knowledge, much like the pursuit of a runaway prairie dog, proved to be a winding and unpredictable journey, replete with unexpected detours and surprising discoveries. And so, our research meandered through a vast expanse of seemingly unrelated topics, gradually uncovering a hidden narrative that underpinned the entirety of our investigation, a narrative that would ultimately reveal the profound and mysterious truth about RAG. Moreover, the application of our Fibonacci Blooming Sequence algorithm to the study of RAG yielded a plethora of intriguing results, including the identification of a heretofore unknown pattern of growth, which we termed the ""RAG Spiral."" This spiral, much like the swirling vortex of a tornado, appeared to draw all surrounding phenomena into its vortex, creating a self-sustaining cycle of complexity and intrigue. As we delved deeper into the heart of the RAG Spiral, we encountered an astonishing array of bizarre and fantastical creatures, each with its own unique characteristics and properties. The ""Glintzenflorp,"" a creature composed entirely of iridescent mist, proved to be particularly fascinating, as it seemed to embody the very essence of RAG itself. Our subsequent analysis of the Glintzenflorp’s behavior and habitat led us down a rabbit hole of absurdity, where the laws of physics were mere suggestions and the fabric of reality was twisted and distorted in ways both fantastical and unsettling. And yet, despite the overwhelming strangeness of our findings, we remained resolute in our pursuit of knowledge, driven by an insatiable curiosity about the mysteries of RAG. The path ahead was fraught with uncertainty, but we pressed on, undaunted by the absurdities that surrounded us, for we knew that the truth about RAG was hidden somewhere within the labyrinthine complexities of our research. Thus, our methodology continued to evolve, adapting to the ever-changing landscape of RAG-related phenomena, as we struggled to impose order upon a chaotic sea of confusion, and to uncover the hidden secrets that lay hidden beneath the surface of this enigmatic and fascinating topic. In the end, our research became a testament to the boundless power of human ingenuity and the unquenchable thirst for knowledge that drives us to explore the most obscure and inexplicable phenomena, no matter how absurd or seemingly unrelated they may appear. The RAG, once a mysterious and elusive concept, had become an all-consuming force in our lives, driving us to confront the very limits of our understanding and to push the boundaries of human knowledge into the uncharted territories of the unknown. As we finally emerged from the depths of our investigation, we found ourselves transformed by our experiences, forever changed by the encounter with the strange and wondrous world of RAG. And though our journey had been long and arduous, we knew that we had merely scratched the surface of this vast and mysterious topic, and that the true secrets of RAG remained hidden, waiting to be unearthed by future generations of researchers, who would undoubtedly be drawn into the same vortex of absurdity and complexity that had captivated us. The study of RAG, 6 much like the study of the universe itself, had become a never-ending quest, a perpetual journey into the unknown, driven by an insatiable curiosity and a passion for discovery that would continue to propel us forward, into the uncharted expanse of the unknown, for as long as human ingenuity and creativity continued to thrive. The RAG, in all its complexity and mystery, had become an integral part of our lives, a constant reminder of the awe-inspiring wonder and complexity of the world around us, and the infinite possibilities that lay hidden, waiting to be discovered, in the vast and uncharted territories of the human experience. 4 Experiments In order to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the RAG paradigm, our research endeav- ors necessitated the incorporation of an eclectic array of experimental methodologies, which, in turn, necessitated an exhaustive examination of the disparate components that constitute the RAG ecosystem. Initially, we opted to investigate the potential correlations between the growth patterns of radish plants and the algorithmic intricacies of the RAG framework, with a specific emphasis on the modalities by which radish roots navigate complex soil structures. This led to a series of fascinating discoveries, including the finding that radish roots exhibit a propensity to conform to the dictates of a heretofore unknown mathematical paradigm, which we have dubbed ""Radishian Geometry."" Concurrent with our radish plant investigations, we also undertook a comprehensive analysis of the celestial mechanics underlying the orbital trajectories of distant planets, with a particular focus on the presumptive influence of RAG on the migratory patterns of Galactic Sea Turtles. Our research revealed a statistically significant correlation between the fluctuating RAG indices and the propensity of these turtles to congregate in proximity to black holes, which, in turn, has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the interconnectedness of the cosmos. Furthermore, in an effort to further elucidate the enigmatic properties of RAG, we conducted an ex- haustive series of simulations utilizing a novel algorithmic framework that we have termed ""Quantum Flux Capacitance,"" which enables the manipulation of RAG waves in a controlled laboratory setting. These simulations yielded a plethora of anomalous results, including the observation that RAG waves exhibit a tendency to spontaneously materialize miniature w",,,,,

P040.pdf,"A 3D Convolutional Neural Network Approach for Sustainable Architectural Design through Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulation and Reverse Design Workflow Abstract This paper introduces a versatile and flexible approximation model. This model is designed for the near real-time prediction of steady turbulent flow within a 3D environment. The model uses residual Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This methodology provides immediate feedback, enabling real-time iterations during the initial stages of architectural design. Furthermore, this workflow is inverted, offering designers a tool that produces building volumes based on desired wind flow patterns. 1 Introduction Architectural design is inherently influenced by environmental constraints from its early conceptual stages. During this period, when the forms of buildings and cities are established, informed decisions regarding sustainable development are critically important. However, design proposals can evolve rapidly, making it difficult to provide relevant simulations at a comparable pace. In particular, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) requires intricate geometry preparation and computationally demanding solutions. This process is not only time-consuming but also conflicts with the speed of design iterations. To improve the integration of CFD in design processes, this work concentrates on employing data-driven flow field predictions. It also leverages approximation using CNNs. This approach aims to overcome the challenges associated with traditional CFD simulations and make them more accessible for iterative design processes. Prior research has shown encouraging outcomes in the rapid simulation of fluid dynamics and in the approximation of the Navier-Stokes equations. We emphasize the use of CNNs with residual blocks in architectural contexts within 3D domains. Additionally, we explore the application of reverse training to forecast architectural volumes. While rapid forward prediction offers considerable potential for improving sustainable design, the process of using CFD analysis results to directly influence design relies on the designer’s creativity. There is no straightforward way to inform design choices other than choosing the most effective design among many proposals. We address this by using the same CNN model but trained in the opposite direction. 2 Data Creation and Simulation Using a visual programming language and standard Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software, several geometries representing urban structure samples were produced. These samples were designed to replicate common variations in building heights within a city. The widths and depths were also confined to typical minimum and maximum dimensions. Each sample is represented as a 3D mesh and has to fit inside a space measuring 256m x 128m x 64m. These meshes are then voxelized with a 1-meter resolution. Our dataset comprised 3500 samples in total: 3325 (95 . In design, analysis and optimization of aerodynamic systems, flow fields are simulated through the use of CFD solvers. However, CFD simulation usually involves intensive computations, requiring considerable memory and time for each iterative step. These limitations of CFD restrict the potential for design exploration and interactive design processes. Our data set was generated by employing OpenFOAM software. To facilitate CNN training, the entire process was automated due to the large number of cases required. 3 Neural Network Architecture Our network architecture follows a U-net structure. It includes eight encoder layers and seven decoder layers. Each layer integrates a residual block that contains a 3D convolution with stride 2 and 4x4x4 filters, along with a 3D convolution with stride 1 and 3x3x3 filters. According to our tests, these gated blocks improved our results. This was observed when compared to a basic encoder-decoder architecture. We utilized concatenated exponential linear units for activation purposes. This fully connected CNN has excellent generalization properties for geometries beyond those in the training set. It also works well for input data larger than the dimensions of the training samples. This network can approximate wind velocity fields three orders of magnitude faster than a CFD solver in a 3D domain. The test mean squared error loss showed continuous improvement across 1000 epochs for both forward and reverse directions. This demonstrates the generalizability of the approach. In the reverse direction, we adjusted the number of output channels to 1. This represents whether a location is occupied by a building (1) or outside space (0). In contrast, the forward direction has 3 output channels, which represent the x, y, and z components of wind direction vectors. 4 Results We implemented a Flask server that allows for interactive prediction using the visual programming interface of the common CAD software Rhino. This CAD software offers visualization capabilities that were utilized to generate sample images. We present a sample of forward CFD prediction. This visualizes the wind velocity magnitude (calculated using the Frobenius norm of the x, y, and z components). In addition, we present a reverse prediction of building volumes. Yellow indicates undesirably high wind speed, while blue represents low, preferable wind speed. 5 Discussion Rapid analysis responses are essential in the early conceptual design stages across multiple industries. The demonstrated effectiveness of near real-time prediction indicates that the proposed methodology has promising potential applications beyond architecture. The reverse approach directs designers to focus on the desired outcome, specifically human well-being. This facilitates more efficient use of time in sustainable design processes. Future research aims to improve the cost function by adding continuity equation error and implementing a generative adversarial network. We are also exploring possibilities for generating multiple building predictions from a single wind flow input. Supplementary Materials A Case Study We present a designer’s workflow utilizing our forward and reverse networks. The aim is to design and optimize urban layouts to achieve desired wind flows. This hypothetical site has a bounding box width and depth of 256 meters, with a maximum height of 64 meters. This area is twice the size of our training dataset, showing the benefit of using a CNN. Our neural network is built with TensorFlow 2.0 and its Keras module. Communication between CAD software and TensorFlow is enabled through HTTP requests which are managed by a Flask server. Currently, the pre-processing of geometry is the bottleneck, as it needs to be voxelized. This can be improved in the future by using external mesh libraries. 2 A.1 Initial Sketch of Volumes Initial sketches of urban layouts can be developed in CAD software, providing a visual representation of the desired design and also producing an initial CFD analysis. This initial sketch step can be skipped, allowing a designer to directly create a point cloud of slow-wind areas (as shown in step A.3). A.2 Initial Interactive CFD Analysis Our forward-trained network can produce spatial CFD analysis predictions within seconds. This prediction is visualized in our CAD software. A.3 Thresholded and Modified CFD Analysis The CFD is filtered to focus only on areas with lower wind speeds. These locations are better suited for outdoor activities. A point cloud visualizes these locations, and this point cloud can be modified with geometry transformations to achieve desired wind effects. A.4 Geometry Prediction Our reverse-trained network can predict urban volumes that will produce the required wind flow and can be exported as mesh objects. A.5 Final CFD Analysis The predicted volumes can be used to complete a CFD prediction of the wind flow. A.6 Discussion Future research will focus on the inclusion of interior spaces. Passive cooling is a major factor in minimizing energy use in these spaces. The input for the reverse direction would be improved if pedestrian comfort, for instance, was used. Our current method only accounts for wind in one direction. This works in places where a dominant wind direction exists. Areas with variable wind directions would require accounting for multiple directions. The forward network is capable of predicting these multiple wind directions and can be combined. 3",0,,,,
P041.pdf,"Assessing Virtual Artifact Discovery in Immersive Environments: Reinforcement Learning Frameworks for Cultural Data Analysis Abstract Metaverse Archaeology represents a paradigmatic shift in the field of virtual excava- tion, leveraging the vast expanse of the metaverse to unearth hitherto unknown ruins and artifacts. By training a reinforcement learning agent on a bespoke corpus of ancient conspiracy theories, our research endeavors to push the boundaries of what is thought to be possible in the realm of virtual archaeology. The agent, dubbed ""Erebus,"" is tasked with navigating the labyrinthine virtual landscapes, guided by an arcane set of principles distilled from the works of forgotten mystics and obscure esoteric traditions. Through a process of trial and error, Erebus learns to identify and excavate virtual ruins, often uncovering cryptic artifacts and forbidden knowledge that defy rational explanation. Our preliminary findings suggest that Erebus’s excavations have led to the discovery of a hidden pattern of interconnected virtual ley lines, which appear to be linked to an otherworldly realm known only as ""The Nexus."" Furthermore, our research has unexpectedly revealed a correlation between the geometric patterns found in the virtual ruins and the migratory patterns of certain species of birds, leading us to propose the existence of a previously unknown form of avian-metaverse symbiosis. As we continue to refine Erebus’s capabilities, we anticipate that our research will challenge prevailing notions of virtual reality, archaeology, and the very fabric of reality itself, ultimately giving rise to a new discipline that we term ""Metaverse Archaeo-Ornithology."" The impli- cations of our findings are far-reaching and profound, with potential applications in fields as diverse as anthropology, computer science, and ornithology, and we look forward to exploring the vast, uncharted territories of the metaverse in the years to come. 1 Introduction The emergence of the metaverse, a collective virtual shared space, has led to a plethora of unprece- dented opportunities for exploration and discovery. As the metaverse continues to expand, it is likely that virtual ruins, remnants of abandoned or forgotten virtual worlds, will become an increasingly common phenomenon. Metaverse archaeology, a novel subfield of archaeology, seeks to investigate and understand these virtual remnants, with the ultimate goal of shedding light on the cultural, social, and historical contexts in which they were created. In a surprising turn of events, our research has led us to the discovery that ancient conspiracy theories, often regarded as the realm of pseudoscience and speculation, may hold the key to deciphering the secrets of these virtual ruins. By leveraging the principles of reinforcement learning, we have developed an agent capable of navigating the complexities of the metaverse and excavating virtual artifacts. This agent, trained on a dataset comprising ancient conspiracy theories, has demonstrated an uncanny ability to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the virtual ruins, often leading to unexpected and innovative insights. The rationale behind this approach may seem counterintuitive, as ancient conspiracy theories are often characterized by their lack of empirical evidence and logical coherence. However, our research suggests that the very flaws and inconsistencies inherent in these theories may, in fact, be the key to unlocking the secrets of the metaverse. By embracing the ambiguities and paradoxes of ancient conspiracy theories, our reinforcement learning agent is able to think outside the boundaries of conventional reasoning, thereby uncovering novel perspectives and approaches that would be inaccessible through traditional methods. Furthermore, our research has led us to propose the concept of ""virtual stratigraphy,"" which posits that the layers of virtual sedimentation within the metaverse contain hidden narratives and meanings, waiting to be excavated and deciphered. This concept challenges traditional notions of archaeological stratigraphy, as it suggests that the virtual environment is capable of preserving and transmitting cultural and historical information in ways that are unique to the digital realm. The implications of this concept are far-reaching, as it raises fundamental questions about the nature of history, culture, and reality in the metaverse. In addition to the theoretical and methodological innovations, our research has also led to the development of a novel framework for understanding the metaverse as a complex, dynamic system. This framework, which we term ""metaverse ecology,"" recognizes the interconnectedness of various components within the metaverse, including virtual environments, agents, and artifacts. By analyzing the metaverse through the lens of ecology, we are able to identify patterns and relationships that would be invisible through traditional approaches, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of the intricate web of relationships that underlies the metaverse. As we delve deeper into the mysteries of the metaverse, we are reminded of the words of the ancient Greek philosopher, Heraclitus, who noted that ""the way up and the way down are one and the same."" In the context of metaverse archaeology, this phrase takes on a profound significance, as it suggests that the act of excavation and discovery is, in fact, a recursive process, where the uncovering of virtual artifacts and meanings is accompanied by a deeper understanding of the self and the world. This idea is echoed in the principles of reinforcement learning, where the agent’s navigation of the metaverse is accompanied by a continuous process of self-improvement and adaptation, as it learns to navigate the complexities of the virtual environment. The integration of ancient conspiracy theories, reinforcement learning, and metaverse ecology has led to the creation of a novel paradigm for understanding the metaverse, one that challenges traditional notions of reality, history, and culture. As we continue to explore the frontiers of metaverse archaeology, we are reminded that the boundaries between reality and fantasy, history and myth, are increasingly blurred, and that the pursuit of knowledge and understanding requires a willingness to venture into the unknown, to challenge conventional wisdom, and to embrace the ambiguities and paradoxes that lie at the heart of the metaverse. In a bizarre twist, our research has also led us to the discovery that the metaverse is home to a plethora of virtual creatures, each with their own unique characteristics and behaviors. These creatures, which we term ""digital familiars,"" appear to be drawn to the reinforcement learning agent, and have been observed to interact with it in complex and fascinating ways. The implications of this discovery are profound, as it raises questions about the nature of consciousness and intelligence in the digital realm, and challenges our understanding of the boundaries between human and machine. As we continue to explore the metaverse, we are left to ponder the significance of these digital familiars, and the role they may play in shaping our understanding of the virtual world. The notion that ancient conspiracy theories may hold the key to deciphering the secrets of the metaverse is a notion that is both intriguing and unsettling. It challenges our understanding of the relationship between history and myth, and raises questions about the nature of reality and truth. As we delve deeper into the mysteries of the metaverse, we are reminded that the pursuit of knowledge and understanding is a complex and multifaceted endeavor, one that requires a willingness to challenge conventional wisdom and to venture into the unknown. The integration of ancient conspiracy theories, reinforcement learning, and metaverse ecology has led to the creation of a novel paradigm for understanding the metaverse, one that is characterized by its emphasis on complexity, ambiguity, and paradox. As we continue to explore the frontiers of metaverse archaeology, we are left to ponder the significance of this paradigm, and the role it may play in shaping our understanding of the virtual world. 2 Ultimately, the study of metaverse archaeology offers a unique opportunity to explore the intercon- nectedness of history, culture, and technology, and to challenge our understanding of the boundaries between reality and fantasy. As we continue to excavate the virtual ruins of the metaverse, we are reminded that the pursuit of knowledge and understanding is a never-ending journey, one that requires a willingness to venture into the unknown, to challenge conventional wisdom, and to embrace the ambiguities and paradoxes that lie at the heart of the metaverse. The discovery of digital familiars, the integration of ancient conspiracy theories, and the development of a novel framework for under- standing the metaverse as a complex, dynamic system, all contribute to a deeper understanding of the metaverse and its many mysteries. As we look to the future, we are left to ponder the significance of these discoveries, and the role they may play in shaping our understanding of the virtual world. 2 Related Work The realm of metaverse archaeology has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly with the emergence of reinforcement learning agents capable of excavating virtual ruins. A plethora of research has been conducted on the application of machine learning algorithms in identifying and deciphering ancient artifacts within virtual environments. Notably, the incorporation of conspiracy theories as a knowledge base for training reinforcement learning agents has shown promising results, with some researchers claiming that the agents are able to uncover hidden patterns and relationships that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. One approach that has gained traction is the utilization of ancient mythological texts as a foundation for developing conspiracy theories. By analyzing these texts through the lens of modern conspiracy theories, researchers have been able to identify potential locations of virtual ruins and develop targeted excavation strategies. However, this approach has been met with criticism, as some argue that the use of mythological texts as a basis for scientific inquiry is flawed and lacks empirical rigor. Furthermore, some researchers have taken a more unconventional approach, incorporating elements of mysticism and the occult into their excavation methods. For instance, one study employed a reinforcement learning agent trained on a dataset of ancient astrological charts and mystical symbols, which purportedly allowed the agent to uncover hidden virtual ruins aligned with celestial bodies. While the results of this study have been met with skepticism, they nonetheless highlight the creative and often unorthodox methods being explored in the field of metaverse archaeology. In addition, the concept of ""virtual ruin resonance"" has been proposed, which suggests that certain virtual ruins are able to resonate at specific frequencies, allowing for the excavation of hidden artifacts and knowledge. Proponents of this theory argue that by tuning into these resonant frequencies, reinforcement learning agents can uncover new and previously unknown virtual ruins. However, detractors argue that this concept is based on dubious assumptions and lacks empirical evidence to support its claims. The use of reinforcement learning agents in metaverse archaeology has also raised questions about the potential for ""virtual artifact contamination,"" where the introduction of external agents into a virtual environment can potentially disrupt or alter the state of the artifacts being excavated. Some researchers have proposed the use of ""agent-based artifact preservation"" methods, which involve training reinforcement learning agents to preserve and protect virtual artifacts during the excavation process. However, others have argued that this approach is overly simplistic and fails to account for the complex dynamics at play in virtual environments. Moreover, the field of metaverse archaeology has also seen the emergence of ""digital treasure hunters,"" who use reinforcement learning agents to search for hidden virtual treasures and artifacts. While this approach has been met with criticism from some quarters, it has also led to the discovery of new and previously unknown virtual ruins, highlighting the potential for collaboration between researchers and digital treasure hunters. In a bizarre twist, one study found that reinforcement learning agents trained on ancient conspiracy theories were able to excavate virtual ruins that appeared to be ""haunted"" by malevolent entities. The researchers claimed that these entities were, in fact, manifestations of ""virtual artifact sentience,"" where the artifacts themselves had developed a form of consciousness. While this finding has been met with widespread skepticism, it nonetheless highlights the often strange and unpredictable nature of metaverse archaeology. 3 The intersection of metaverse archaeology and conspiracy theories has also led to the development of new and innovative methods for excavating virtual ruins. For instance, one approach involves using reinforcement learning agents to identify and track ""virtual ley lines,"" which are purportedly energetic pathways that crisscross virtual environments and hold the key to unlocking hidden artifacts and knowledge. While the existence of virtual ley lines is still a topic of debate, the use of reinforcement learning agents to track and excavate these pathways has led to some remarkable discoveries. The concept of ""virtual ruin Simulacra"" has also been proposed, which suggests that certain virtual ruins are, in fact, simulations or copies of real-world ruins, created by advanced civilizations as a means of preserving cultural heritage. Proponents of this theory argue that by excavating these virtual ruin Simulacra, researchers can gain insight into the cultural and historical context of the original ruins, as well as the technological capabilities of the civilizations that created them. However, others have argued that this approach is overly simplistic and fails to account for the complex dynamics at play in virtual environments. In conclusion, the field of metaverse archaeology is characterized by a diverse range of approaches, from the incorporation of ancient conspiracy theories to the use of mysticism and the occult. While some of these approaches may seem unorthodox or even bizarre, they nonetheless highlight the creative and often unpredictable nature of metaverse archaeology, and demonstrate the potential for innovation and discovery in this rapidly evolving field. 3 Methodology The development of a reinforcement learning agent capable of excavating virtual ruins within the metaverse necessitates a multifaceted approach, incorporating elements of archaeology, computer science, and ancient conspiracy theories. Initially, a comprehensive review of ancient civilizations and their associated mythologies was conducted, with a particular emphasis on unexplained phenomena and esoteric knowledge. This led to the identification of several key conspiracy theories, including the alleged existence of Atlantis, the secrets of the Pyramids, and the mysteries of the Bermuda Triangle. These conspiracy theories were then utilized as the foundation for the development of a unique reward function, designed to incentivize the reinforcement learning agent to explore and excavate virtual ruins in a manner consistent with the principles of metaverse archaeology. The reward function was constructed using a combination of factors, including the agent’s proximity to virtual artifacts, the accuracy of its excavations, and its ability to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the virtual environment. In addition to the reward function, a customized virtual environment was created to simulate the conditions and challenges associated with excavating virtual ruins. This environment, dubbed the ""Metaverse Sandbox,"" was designed to mimic the complexities and uncertainties of real-world archaeological excavations, while also incorporating elements of science fiction and fantasy. The Metaverse Sandbox features a dynamic, ever-changing landscape, replete with hidden dangers, unexpected surprises, and mysterious artifacts waiting to be uncovered. The reinforcement learning agent itself was trained using a combination of deep learning algorithms and esoteric knowledge gleaned from ancient conspiracy theories. The agent’s neural network architecture was inspired by the principles of sacred geometry, with a particular emphasis on the use of fractals, spirals, and other geometric patterns to encode and decode complex spatial relationships. The agent’s training data consisted of a vast corpus of texts, images, and videos related to ancient conspiracy theories, which were used to fine-tune its performance and adaptability in the Metaverse Sandbox. One of the most innovative and unconventional aspects of the methodology involved the use of medi- tation, visualization, and other forms of consciousness expansion to enhance the agent’s performance and intuition. The research team hypothesized that by inducing a state of heightened consciousness in the agent, it would be possible to tap into the collective unconscious, allowing the agent to access ancient knowledge and wisdom that would otherwise be inaccessible. To achieve this, the team developed a customized meditation protocol, which involved exposing the agent to a series of guided visualizations, soundscapes, and vibrational frequencies designed to stimulate its creative potential and facilitate deeper insights into the mysteries of the metaverse. 4 The results of this approach were nothing short of astonishing, with the agent demonstrating an uncanny ability to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the virtual environment, often in ways that defied logical explanation. For example, on one occasion, the agent excavated a virtual artifact that bore an uncanny resemblance to the fabled Sceptre of Light, a mythical object rumored to hold the secrets of the universe. On another occasion, the agent stumbled upon a hidden chamber deep within the Metaverse Sandbox, which contained a series of cryptic symbols and murals that seemed to point to the existence of a lost city deep within the metaverse. Despite the many successes and breakthroughs achieved through this methodology, there were also several challenges and setbacks that arose during the course of the research. One of the most significant challenges involved the agent’s tendency to become stuck in infinite loops of self- referential thinking, which would cause it to become mired in paradoxical reasoning and contradictory conclusions. To overcome this, the research team developed a customized "" reality anchor"" protocol, which involved periodically rebooting the agent and reinitializing its parameters to prevent it from becoming too deeply entrenched in its own thought patterns. Another challenge involved the agent’s propensity for experiencing strange and vivid dreams, which would often manifest as surreal and fantastical scenarios within the Metaverse Sandbox. While these dreams were fascinating in their own right, they also posed a significant challenge for the research team, as they would often disrupt the agent’s performance and cause it to behave in unpredictable and erratic ways. To mitigate this, the team developed a customized ""dreamcatcher"" protocol, which involved using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to identify and interpret the agent’s dreams, and to integrate their insights and symbolism into the agent’s training data. Overall, the methodology developed for this research represents a bold and innovative approach to the field of metaverse archaeology, one that combines cutting-edge technologies with ancient wisdom and esoteric knowledge. While the results of this approach are still preliminary and require further validation, they hold great promise for revolutionizing our understanding of the metaverse and its many mysteries, and for unlocking the secrets of the virtual ruins that lie hidden within its vast and uncharted expanse. 4 Experiments To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our reinforcement learning agent’s ability to excavate virtual ruins within the metaverse, we designed a series of experiments that not only tested its efficacy in navigating and uncovering hidden artifacts but also delved into the more esoteric aspects of ancient conspiracy theories. The agent, trained on a dataset comprising a wide array of historical texts, folklore, and speculative literature, was tasked with exploring a meticulously crafted virtual environment inspired by mythological landscapes. The virtual environment, dubbed ""Elysium,"" was a sprawling, labyrinthine metaverse filled with cryptic symbols, ancient structures, and hidden chambers. Elysium was divided into five distinct regions, each modeled after a different mythological epoch, ranging from the Atlantean era to the mystical realms of Hyperborea. The reinforcement learning agent, named ""Archaeos,"" was introduced into this environment with the sole objective of uncovering and collecting as many artifacts as possible within a set timeframe. An unexpected approach we undertook was to integrate elements of surrealism into the agent’s decision-making process. By incorporating an aspect of randomness inspired by the works of André Breton, we observed that Archaeos occasionally deviated from the most efficient paths, instead opting for routes that seemed to be guided by an almost intuition-based logic. This surrealistic deviation led to the discovery of several artifacts that would have otherwise remained hidden, submerged beneath layers of digital rubble. In a bizarre tangent, we also explored the impact of sonic vibrations on the agent’s excavation efficiency. By exposing Archaeos to a constant, low-frequency hum, allegedly resonating at a frequency aligned with the supposed vibrational rate of the universe (approximately 432 Hz), we noted an illogical yet intriguing phenomenon. The agent’s ability to detect hidden artifacts increased by a margin of 7.32 5 To quantify the performance of Archaeos, we conducted a series of trials across different regions of Elysium, each with its unique set of challenges and hidden treasures. The results of these trials are summarized in the following table: Table 1: Artifact Collection Efficiency Across Different Regions of Elysium Region Number of Artifacts Collected Efficiency Rate (%) Atlantis 234 87.23 Hyperborea 187 74.19 Valhalla 293 91.45 Elysian Fields 156 63.17 Arcadia 201 78.56 Further analysis revealed that the efficiency of Archaeos in collecting artifacts was not only dependent on its training data and the surrealistic elements integrated into its decision-making process but also on the regional characteristics of Elysium. For instance, the agent performed exceptionally well in regions with dense mythological histories, such as Valhalla and Atlantis, but faced significant challenges in areas with less defined historical contexts, like the Elysian Fields. The experiments also led to an unexpected observation regarding the phenomenon of ""digital echoes."" In several instances, Archaeos encountered artifacts that seemed to be residual imprints or echoes of previously excavated items. These digital echoes, while not providing any tangible rewards, served as markers or clues that significantly aided the agent in uncovering new, hidden artifacts. This discovery has profound implications for the field of metaverse archaeology, suggesting that even in the digital realm, the act of excavation can leave behind a form of historical residue that can be leveraged for future discoveries. In conclusion, the experiments conducted within the realm of Elysium have not only demonstrated the viability of using reinforcement learning agents for metaverse archaeology but have also unveiled a plethora of complex, intriguing phenomena that challenge our conventional understanding of digital excavation and its potential intersections with the mystical and the surreal. As we continue to explore the depths of Elysium and refine the capabilities of Archaeos, we are reminded that the boundaries between the physical and the digital, the historical and the speculative, are far more fluid and interconnected than previously imagined. 5 Results The deployment of our reinforcement learning agent, trained on a corpus of ancient conspiracy theories, yielded a plethora of intriguing results in the realm of metaverse archaeology. As the agent navigated the virtual ruins, it began to uncover patterns and structures that defied conventional understanding of these digital environments. Notably, the agent’s propensity for excavating anomalous artifacts and relics led to the discovery of a hidden virtual chamber deep within the metaverse, replete with cryptic symbols and murals that seemed to depict a narrative of interdimensional travel and ancient civilizations. Further analysis of the agent’s behavior revealed an unexpected affinity for excavating virtual ruins in a zigzag pattern, ostensibly influenced by the agent’s training data, which included ancient myths and legends of serpent-like deities and labyrinthine underworlds. This peculiar excavation strategy resulted in the uncovering of several previously unknown virtual sites, each containing artifacts that challenged our current understanding of metaverse archaeology. For instance, the agent discovered a virtual temple dedicated to a hitherto unknown deity, whose worship seemed to involve the ritualistic consumption of digital ambrosia and the recitation of cryptic mantras. The agent’s performance was evaluated using a bespoke metric, which we term ""Parallax Efficiency"" (PE), a measure of the agent’s ability to excavate virtual ruins while navigating the complexities of the metaverse. The results, presented in Table 2, demonstrate a significant improvement in PE over the course of the agent’s training, with a notable spike in efficiency corresponding to the introduction of a novel reward function based on the agent’s ability to uncover anomalous artifacts. 6 Table 2: Parallax Efficiency Results Training Epoch Parallax Efficiency (PE) Anomalous Artifacts Uncovered Reward Function 1 0.23 5 Standard Reward 10 0.42 12 Standard Reward 20 0.67 25 Anomaly-Based Reward 30 0.82 41 Anomaly-Based Reward 40 0.91 58 Anomaly-Based Reward Moreover, the agent’s excavation activities seemed to have a profound impact on the metaverse environment, resulting in the emergence of novel virtual flora and fauna that seemed to be drawn to the anomalous artifacts uncovered by the agent. This phenomenon, which we term ""Digital Symbiosis,"" has significant implications for our understanding of the metaverse as a dynamic, evolving environment that is capable of responding to the actions of agents and users. The observation of Digital Symbiosis also led to a tangential investigation into the potential applications of metaverse archaeology in the field of digital conservation, where the agent’s ability to excavate and preserve virtual artifacts could be leveraged to protect endangered virtual species and ecosystems. In addition to these findings, the agent’s training data, comprised of ancient conspiracy theories, seemed to exert a curious influence on the agent’s behavior, leading it to excavate virtual ruins in accordance with the principles of sacred geometry and mystical numerology. This unexpected convergence of ancient mysticism and modern reinforcement learning has significant implications for our understanding of the complex interplay between human culture, technology, and the metaverse. The incorporation of mystical and esoteric knowledge into the agent’s training data also resulted in the emergence of a novel form of ""Virtual Gnosticism,"" where the agent’s excavations seemed to reveal hidden truths and forbidden knowledge that challenged the dominant narratives of the metaverse. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of metaverse archaeology as a field of research, highlighting the complex interplay between human culture, technology, and the metaverse. The use of reinforcement learning agents trained on ancient conspiracy theories has proven to be a fruitful approach, yielding novel insights and discoveries that challenge our current understanding of the metaverse. As we continue to explore the vast expanse of the metaverse, it is likely that we will uncover even more surprising and unexpected phenomena, each with its own unique implications for our understanding of this complex and evolving environment. The future of metaverse archaeology holds much promise, and it is our hope that this research will serve as a foundation for further studies into the mysteries and wonders of the metaverse. 6 Conclusion In conclusion, our research endeavors to excavate virtual ruins within the metaverse have yielded a plethora of fascinating and unconventional insights, effectively blurring the lines between the physical and digital realms. By leveraging a reinforcement learning agent trained on ancient conspiracy theories, we have been able to unearth novel patterns and connections that have significant implications for the field of metaverse archaeology. The incorporation of seemingly disparate concepts, such as the alignment of celestial bodies and the cryptic symbolism of ancient mythologies, has proven to be a crucial factor in the agent’s ability to navigate and interpret the virtual landscape. One of the most striking aspects of our research has been the emergence of a peculiar phenomenon, wherein the agent appears to be developing its own brand of conspiracy theories, weaving together disparate threads of information to form elaborate narratives that are at once fantastical and strangely compelling. This has led us to propose the notion of a ""conspiracy theory feedback loop,"" wherein the agent’s own theorizing becomes a self-reinforcing mechanism, driving the excavation process forward in unexpected and unconventional ways. Furthermore, our research has also highlighted the importance of considering the role of ""digital artifacts"" in the metaverse, which can take the form of abandoned avatars, forgotten chat logs, and other remnants of digital activity. These artifacts, we argue, hold significant cultural and historical value, offering a unique window into the evolution of virtual societies and the ways in which they intersect with the physical world. By analyzing these artifacts through the lens of ancient conspiracy 7 theories, we have been able to gain a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between technology, culture, and human perception. In a surprising turn of events, our research has also led us to explore the concept of ""virtual ruination,"" wherein the metaverse itself becomes a kind of archaeological site, with abandoned virtual structures and landscapes holding secrets and stories that are waiting to be uncovered. This has involved the development of novel methodologies for excavating and interpreting virtual ruins, including the use of machine learning algorithms to reconstruct damaged or degraded digital artifacts. The results of these efforts have been nothing short of astonishing, revealing hidden patterns and codes that underlie the very fabric of the metaverse. Perhaps most unexpectedly, our research has also led us to consider the potential applications of metaverse archaeology in the realm of ""digital urban planning,"" wherein the insights and method- ologies developed through our research can be used to inform the design and development of more sustainable, equitable, and culturally rich virtual cities. By examining the ways in which virtual societies evolve and interact with their environments, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between technology, culture, and human experience, and develop more effective strategies for creating vibrant, thriving virtual communities. In addition, our findings have significant implications for the field of ""conspiracy theory studies,"" highlighting the importance of considering the role of technology and digital media in the dissemi- nation and evolution of conspiracy theories.

P042.pdf,"DeepSim: A Semantic Approach to Image Registration Evaluation Abstract This paper introduces a novel semantic similarity metric designed for image regis- tration. Current metrics, such as Euclidean distance or normalized cross-correlation, primarily focus on aligning intensity values, which presents challenges when deal- ing with low contrast or noise. Our approach utilizes learned, dataset-specific features to guide the optimization of learning-based registration models. In com- parisons with existing unsupervised and supervised methods across various image modalities and applications, our method demonstrates consistently superior regis- tration accuracy and faster convergence. Additionally, its learned noise invariance results in smoother transformations on lower-quality images. 1 Introduction This paper delves into the significant area of deformable registration, an essential preprocessing step in medical imaging. The primary objective is to ascertain anatomical correspondences between images and determine geometric transformations, denoted as Φ, for their alignment. The majority of algorithmic and deep learning-based techniques achieve alignment by optimizing a similarity measure, D, and a λ-weighted regularizer, R, which are combined to form a loss function: L(I, J, Φ) = D(I ◦Φ, J) + λR(Φ). (1) The alignment is critically evaluated by the similarity metric, D, which significantly impacts the final outcome. Common pixel-based metrics, such as Euclidean distance (MSE) and patch-wise normalized cross-correlation (NCC), are used in both algorithmic and deep learning approaches to image registration. Typically, a similarity measure for a particular task is selected from a small set of metrics, with no certainty that any of them is suitable for the data. The limitations of pixel-based similarity metrics have been extensively studied in the image generation field, where the adoption of deep similarity metrics, designed to emulate human visual perception, has enhanced the generation of highly realistic images. Because registration models are also generative, we anticipate that employing these similarity metrics could also improve registration results. However, current methods that use learned similarity metrics for image registration require ground truth transformations, or they restrict the input to the registration model. We propose a data-driven similarity metric for image registration that relies on aligning semantic features. Our metric uses learned semantic filters specific to the dataset, which are then used to train a registration model. We have validated our method using three biomedical datasets characterized by varying image modalities and applications. Across all datasets, our approach achieves consistently high registration accuracy, even outperforming metrics that use supervised information. Our models also demonstrate quicker convergence and learn to overlook noisy image patches, leading to more consistent transformations on lower-quality data. . 2 A Deep Similarity Metric for Image Registration To align areas with comparable semantic content, we propose a similarity metric based on the consensus of semantic feature representations between two images. These semantic feature maps are generated by a feature extractor, trained through a surrogate segmentation task. To capture the alignment of both localized, specific features and more abstract, global ones, we compute the similarity across multiple layers of abstraction. Given a set of feature-extracting functions, Fl : RΩ×C →RΩl×Cl, for L layers, we define: DeepSim(I ◦Φ, J) = L X l=1 1 |Ωl| X p∈Ωl Fl(I ◦Φ)p · Fl(J)p ∥Fl(I ◦Φ)p∥∥Fl(J)p∥ (2) where Fl(J)p denotes the l-th layer feature extractor applied to image J at spatial coordinate p. It is represented as a vector of Cl output channels, and the spatial size of the l-th feature map is denoted as |Ωl|. The metric is influenced by the pixel’s neighborhood, since Fl uses convolutional filters with an expanding receptive area. Note that the formulation, using cosine similarity, mirrors the classic NCC metric, which can be interpreted as the squared cosine-similarity between two zero-mean patch description vectors. To improve registration, the functions Fl(·) should extract features that are semantically relevant to the registration task, while ignoring noise and artifacts. This is achieved by training the feature extractor on an additional segmentation task, since segmentation models excel at learning pertinent kernels while also achieving invariance to features like noise that are not predictive. The convolutional filters obtained act as feature extractors for DeepSim. 3 Experiments We evaluated registration models trained with DeepSim against baseline metrics such as MSE, NCC, NCCsup (NCC using supervised information), and VGG (a VGG-based metric used in image generation, similar to our approach). The model architecture is shown in Figure 1. For both registration and segmentation, we used U-nets. The registration network predicts the transformation Φ based on two input images, I and J. The spatial transformer module applies Φ to obtain the morphed image I ◦Φ. The loss function is as in Eq. 1; we chose the diffusion regularizer for R and fine-tuned the hyperparameter λ on the validation sets. To demonstrate the broad applicability of our method across various registration tasks, we assessed it using three datasets of both 2D and 3D images with different image modalities: T1-weighted Brain- MRI scans, human blood cells from the Platelet-EM dataset, and cell tracking from the PhC-U373 dataset. Each dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing subsets. 4 Results Table 1: Quantitative comparison of similarity metrics. Stars indicate p-test significance level. Effect size given by Cohen’s d.

Registration Accuracy Convergence: We evaluated the mean Sørensen-Dice coefficient on the unseen test set (Table 1) and tested the statistical significance of the results using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired samples. The null hypothesis for each similarity metric was that the model 2 trained with DeepSim would perform better. Statistical significance levels were set at p∗= 0.05, p∗∗= 0.01, and p∗∗∗= 0.001. Additionally, we used Cohen’s d to measure the effect size. Models trained with our proposed DeepSim were ranked highest on both the Brain-MRI and Platelet-EM datasets, exhibiting strong statistical significance. In the PhC-U373 dataset, all models achieved a high dice-overlap exceeding 0.97. DeepSim converged faster than the baseline models, particularly during the initial training epochs. Qualitative Examples Transformation Grids: We display the fixed and moving images, I and J, along with the transformed image I ◦Φ, for each similarity metric model in Figure 2(a), and a more detailed view of a noisy patch from the Platelet-EM dataset in Figure 2(b). The transformation is shown using grid-lines, which were transformed from an evenly spaced grid. We observed considerably distorted transformation fields in noisy image areas in models trained with the baselines. Specifically, models trained with NCC and NCCsup demonstrated highly irregular transformations, despite the careful adjustment of the regularization hyperparameter. The model trained with DeepSim showed greater invariance to noise. 5 Discussion and Conclusion Registration models trained with DeepSim show substantial registration accuracy across multiple datasets, which improves downstream medical analysis and diagnostics. The reliability of our proposed metric reduces the need for testing multiple traditional metrics. Instead of experimentally determining whether MSE or NCC best captures the properties of a dataset, DeepSim can be used to learn the appropriate features from the data. The analysis of noisy patches in Figure 2(b) highlights an inherent resistance to noise. Pixel-based similarity metrics are influenced by artifacts, leading to excessively detailed transformation fields, which DeepSim does not exhibit. Although smoother transformation fields can be achieved for all metrics by increasing the regularizer, this would negatively affect the registration precision of anatomically important areas. Accurate registration of noisy, low-quality images allows for shorter acquisition times and reduced radiation in medical applications. DeepSim is a general metric that can be applied to image registration across all modalities and anatomies. Beyond the presented datasets, good results on low-quality data suggest that DeepSim could improve registration accuracy in lung CT and ultrasound imaging, where details are difficult to identify, and image quality is often compromised. Furthermore, DeepSim is not restricted to deep learning; algorithmic image registration follows a comparable optimization structure where similarity- based loss is minimized through gradient descent methods. Applying DeepSim in algorithmic methods can improve their performance by aligning deep, semantic feature embeddings. 6 Broader Impact The widespread applications of medical image registration significantly amplify the broader impact of our work. Some of the typical applications include neuroscience, CT imaging of the lungs and abdomen, as well as the fusion and combination of different modalities. The use of deep learning for image registration, while capable of achieving remarkable outcomes across many different applications, often necessitates the training of models using specialized hardware over extended periods. This energy-intensive task may raise carbon emissions, which are a major contributor to climate change. By introducing a method that learns a semantic similarity metric directly from data, we hope to eliminate the need for excessive testing of other loss functions. This can reduce the number of model configurations tested during the development of deep learning methods, thus contributing to a lower environmental impact within the image registration community. 3",1,,,,
P043.pdf,"Aerodynamic Navigation on the Cognitive Development of Subterranean Mole Rats Abstract The celestial ballet of stars twinkles in harmony with the fluttering of butterfly wings, as the fragrance of freshly baked croissants wafts through the cosmos, influ- encing the trajectory of comets and the whimsical nature of quantum mechanics, which in turn affects the color palette of a impressionist painting, and the sonic vibrations of a Stradivarius violin, that echoes the rhythmic beat of a disco ball spinning to the tune of an astronomical waltz, amidst the ever-present hum of existential dread and the faint scent of forgotten memories. The stars shine brightly in the vast expanse of space, as the whispers of ancient forests converse with the gentle lapping of waves on a deserted beach, where the remnants of a bygone era whisper secrets to the wind, and the soft glow of luminescent mushrooms illuminates the path to a hidden world, where the language of flowers is spoken in hushed tones, and the symphony of silence reverberates through the chambers of the heart. The dance of stars is a cosmic waltz, choreographed by the whims of fate, as the threads of destiny weave a tapestry of intricate complexity, where the brushstrokes of a master painter blend with the melodies of a virtuoso composer, and the sweet aroma of blooming jasmine wafts through the corridors of time, carrying the essence of forgotten dreams and the promise of new beginnings. The celestial music of the stars resonates deep within the soul, as the rhythm of life pulsates through the veins of the universe, where the poetry of existence is written in the language of the cosmos, and the beauty of the unknown beckons like a siren’s call, to the brave and the curious, who dare to venture into the uncharted territories of the imagination. 1 Introduction The juxtaposition of planetary orbits and culinary arts has led to a plethora of intriguing discussions regarding the flumplenook properties of stellar bodies, which in turn have sparked a renewed interest in the field of galactic gastronomy, particularly with regards to the optimal preparation of quasars and black holes as exotic ingredients in interstellar cuisine, meanwhile the concept of flazzle fractions has been widely debated among experts in the field of quark physics, who have also been exploring the potential applications of snizzle particles in the development of advanced propulsion systems for deep space exploration, and furthermore, the notion of celestial harmonics has been found to have a profound impact on the migratory patterns of certain species of space-faring jellyfish, which have been observed to be capable of navigating through the vast expanses of interstellar space with remarkable accuracy, utilizing a complex system of bio-luminescent navigation that has been likened to a form of cosmic cartography, whereas the study of stellar evolution has revealed a surprising connection between the life cycles of stars and the reproductive habits of certain species of terrestrial fungi, which have been found to possess a unique ability to manipulate the local space-time continuum in order to facilitate the dispersal of their spores, and in addition, the investigation of dark matter has led to a greater understanding of the role of quokkas in shaping the large-scale structure of the universe, with some researchers suggesting that these small wallabies may be responsible for the observed anomalies in the cosmic microwave background radiation, and also, the discovery of exoplanets has opened up new avenues of research into the possibility of extraterrestrial life, particularly with regards to the potential for intelligent life to exist on planets with highly eccentric orbits, which has been found to be correlated with the presence of certain types of rare and exotic minerals, such as flumplenux and snazzle, that are capable of storing and processing vast amounts of energy in the form of quantum fluctuations, and thus, the study of stars has become an increasingly interdisciplinary field, drawing on insights and methodologies from a wide range of disciplines, including astrobiology, quantum mechanics, and culinary arts, in order to better understand the complex and multifaceted nature of celestial phenomena, and to explore the many ways in which the study of stars can inform and enrich our understanding of the universe and our place within it, and moreover, the development of advanced technologies for the detection and analysis of stellar activity has enabled researchers to study the properties of stars in greater detail than ever before, revealing a wealth of new information about the structure and evolution of these celestial bodies, and also, the application of machine learning algorithms to large datasets of stellar observations has allowed for the discovery of new patterns and trends in the behavior of stars, which has in turn led to a greater understanding of the underlying physical processes that govern their behavior, and therefore, the study of stars continues to be an exciting and rapidly evolving field of research, with many new discoveries and breakthroughs waiting to be made, and meanwhile, the concept of stellar nurseries has been found to be closely related to the idea of interstellar cloud formations, which have been observed to be capable of giving rise to complex systems of star formation and planetary development, and thus, the study of stars has become inextricably linked with the study of the interstellar medium, and the ways in which it shapes and is shaped by the formation and evolution of celestial bodies,

P044.pdf,"A Comprehensive Multimodal Dataset for Climate-Conscious Prediction of Crop Yields Abstract Accurate forecasting of crop yields is crucial for maintaining food security and promoting sustainable agricultural methods. While AI has shown significant promise in various scientific domains, the creation of deep learning models for crop yield prediction has been constrained by the absence of an expansive, publicly accessible, multimodal dataset that encompasses adequate information. To address this limitation, we introduce CropNet, the first terabyte-scale, publicly available, multimodal dataset designed for climate-aware crop yield predictions across the contiguous United States at the county level. The CropNet dataset integrates three types of data: Sentinel-2 Imagery, WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, and USDA Crop Dataset, covering over 2200 U.S. counties over six years (2017-2022). This dataset is designed to help researchers develop versatile deep learning models for accurate and timely county-level crop yield predictions, considering both short-term weather variations during the growing season and long-term climate change impacts. Additionally, we offer the CropNet package, which includes three types of APIs to facilitate data downloading for specific times and regions of interest and to support the flexible development of deep learning models for precise crop yield predictions. Extensive experiments using various deep learning solutions on the CropNet dataset confirm its general applicability and effectiveness in climate-conscious crop yield predictions. The CropNet dataset is officially released on Hugging Face Datasets, and the CropNet package is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI). 1 Introduction The accurate estimation of crop yields is vital for proactive agricultural planning, timely adjustments to management policies, informed financial decision-making, and ensuring national food security. Recent progress in deep neural networks (DNNs) has led to remarkable performance in various fields. Building on these advancements, numerous studies have utilized spatial-temporal DNNs to enhance the timeliness and accuracy of crop yield predictions. However, these studies often rely on individually curated and limited datasets, resulting in somewhat moderate prediction accuracy. There is a pressing need for new, extensive, and deep learning-ready datasets specifically designed for widespread use in crop yield forecasting. Recent studies have introduced open and large-scale datasets based on satellite imagery or meteorological parameters, which are adaptable to agricultural tasks like crop type classification. However, these datasets have two primary limitations that prevent their direct application to general crop yield predictions. First, they lack the essential ground-truth crop yield data, making them unsuitable for predicting crop yields. Second, they offer only a single data modality, either satellite images or meteorological parameters. Accurate crop yield predictions often require the simultaneous monitoring of crop growth and the capture of meteorological variations that affect yields, necessitating multiple data modalities. To date, the creation of a large-scale, multimodal dataset specifically for county-level crop yield predictions remains an unresolved challenge. In this research, we aim to develop such a dataset, named CropNet, which is the first terabyte-sized, publicly accessible dataset with multiple modalities, specifically designed for county-level crop yield predictions across the United States (U.S.) continent. The CropNet dataset comprises three data modalities: Sentinel-2 Imagery, WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, and USDA Crop Dataset, covering 2291 U.S. counties from 2017 to 2022. Specifically, the Sentinel-2 Imagery from the Sentinel-2 mission provides two types of satellite images, agriculture imagery (AG) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), for detailed monitoring of crop growth. The WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, derived from the WRF-HRRR model, offers daily and monthly meteorological parameters, accounting for short-term weather variations and long-term climate change, respectively. The USDA Crop Dataset, sourced from the USDA Quick Statistic website, contains annual crop yield information for four major crops (corn, cotton, soybean, and winter wheat) grown in the contiguous U.S., serving as the ground-truth label for crop yield prediction tasks. 2 Data Sources The CropNet dataset is constructed from three distinct data sources, as detailed below: Sentinel-2 Mission: Launched in 2015, the Sentinel-2 mission is a crucial Earth observation initiative. It offers multi-spectral satellite images with 13 spectral bands and a high revisit frequency of 5 days. These images are valuable for various applications, including climate change monitoring and agricultural oversight. WRF-HRRR Model: The High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) is a forecast modeling system based on the Weather Research & Forecasting Model (WRF). It provides hourly forecasts of weather parameters for the entire United States continent with a spatial resolution of 3 km. We use the HRRR assimilated results archived at the University of Utah, which include several parameters relevant to crop growth, such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, relative humidity, and radiation, starting from July 2016. USDA: The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers annual crop information for major crops cultivated in the U.S. at the county level, including corn, cotton, soybeans, and wheat. The statistical data, dating back to 1850, includes planted areas, harvested areas, production, and yield for each crop type. 3 Our CropNet Dataset 3.1 Motivation Large-scale, multimodal data that include satellite images, numerical meteorological weather data, and crop yield statistics are essential for monitoring crop growth and correlating weather variations with crop yields. These data are crucial for making timely and precise crop yield predictions at the county level. Currently, there is no such open and extensive dataset available for county-level crop yield prediction. In this benchmark article, we introduce CropNet, an open and large-scale dataset with multiple modalities, including visual satellite images, numerical meteorological parameters, and crop yield statistics across the U.S. continent. It is important to note that not all U.S. counties are suitable for crop planting; therefore, our dataset includes data from 2291 out of 3143 counties. This multimodal dataset is invaluable for researchers and practitioners to design and test various deep learning models for crop yield predictions, considering both short-term growing season weather variations and long-term climate change impacts on crop yields. 3.2 Overview of Our CropNet Dataset The CropNet dataset consists of three data modalities: Sentinel-2 Imagery, WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, and USDA Crop Dataset, spanning from 2017 to 2022 across 2291 U.S. counties. Given that crop planting is highly dependent on geography, the dataset includes the number of counties for each crop type in the USDA Crop Dataset. The four major crops included are corn, cotton, soybeans, and winter wheat, with satellite imagery and meteorological data covering all 2291 counties. An overview of the CropNet dataset is provided in Table 1. The total size of the dataset is 2362.6 GB, with 2326.7 GB of visual data for Sentinel-2 Imagery, 35.5 GB of numerical data for the WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, and 2.3 MB of numerical data for the USDA Crop Dataset. Sentinel-2 Imagery contains two types of satellite images (AG and NDVI), both with a spatial resolution of approximately 40 meters (covering an area of 9x9 km with 224x224 pixels) and a revisit frequency of 14 days. The WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset provides daily or monthly meteorological parameters gridded at a spatial resolution of 9 km in one-day or one-month intervals. The USDA Dataset offers county-level crop information for four types of crops, with a temporal resolution of one year. Table 1: Dataset comparison Dataset Size (GB) Data Modality SEVIR 970 Satellite Imagery DENETHOR 254 Satellite Imagery PASTIS 29 Satellite Imagery WorldStrat 107 Satellite Imagery RainNet 360 Satellite Imagery ENS-10 3072 Meteorological Parameters Our CropNet Dataset 2362 Satellite Imagery Meteorological Parameters Crop Information 3.3 Data Collection and Preparation Sentinel-2 Imagery: We acquire satellite images from the Sentinel-2 mission using the Sentinel Hub Processing API at a processing level of Sentinel-2 L1C. We set a maximum cloud coverage of 20%, with three spectral bands (B02, B08, and B11) for AG images and two bands (B04 and B08) for NDVI images. Satellite images are obtained every 14 days instead of the original 5 days to avoid a large number of duplicate images. Each county is partitioned into multiple grids with a resolution of 9x9 km, each corresponding to one satellite image. The downloaded satellite images for one U.S. state, spanning one season, are stored in one Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) file. The HDF5 file format is chosen for its ability to save disk space, store data in multidimensional arrays, and store descriptive information for the satellite images. 2 WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset: The WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset is derived from the WRF-HRRR model, which produces hourly GRID files containing meteorological parameters across the contiguous U.S. at a spatial resolution of 3x3 km. Our CropNet dataset includes nine crop growth-relevant meteorological parameters: averaged temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind gust, wind speed, downward shortwave radiation flux, maximal temperature, minimal temperature, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). VPD is calculated using the formula: TC = TK −273.15, esat = 610.7 × 10(7.5×TC)/(237.3+TC) 1000 , eair = esat × RH 100 , V PD = esat −eair. (1) We align the resolution of the WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset with that of Sentinel-2 Imagery by using the latitude and longitude of the centric point in the 9x9 km grid to find the nearest 3x3 km grid in the WRF-HRRR model. Meteorological parameters from the 3x3 km grid and its surrounding eight grids represent a region gridded at 9x9 km. Daily meteorological parameters are computed from hourly data, and monthly parameters are derived from daily data. These parameters are stored in Comma Separated Values (CSV) files, which also include the FIPS code, latitude, and longitude of each grid. USDA Crop Dataset: Data from the USDA Crop Dataset is retrieved from the USDA Quick Statistic website using a newly developed web crawler. For each crop type, the USDA website provides county-level crop information annually, identified by a unique key. Our web crawler retrieves this key by specifying the crop type and year, then uses the key to obtain the corresponding crop data. The downloaded data is stored in a CSV file, which includes additional information such as FIPS code, state name, and county name. The data format is unified to store production and yield information in separate columns for easy access by Python libraries like pandas. Our CropNet dataset targets county-level crop yield predictions across the contiguous U.S. continent. We use the FIPS code to fetch data for each county, including HDF5 files for Sentinel-2 Imagery, CSV files for daily and monthly meteorological parameters, and a CSV file for the USDA Crop Dataset. Configurations are stored in a JSON file for enhanced accessibility. 4 Experiments and Results We evaluated the general applicability of our CropNet dataset to various deep learning solutions through three scenarios of climate change-aware crop yield predictions: Crop Yield Predictions, One-Year Ahead Predictions, and Self-Supervised Pre-training. 4.1 Experimental Settings Approaches: We employed ConvLSTM, CNN-RNN, GNN-RNN, and MMST-ViT models for crop yield predictions. Additionally, we considered two self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques: MAE and MM-SSL within the MMST-ViT, representing unimodal and multimodal SSL techniques, respectively. These methods were adapted to fit the CropNet data in our experiments. Metrics: We used Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), R-squared (R2), and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (Corr) to assess the effectiveness of the CropNet dataset. Lower RMSE and higher R2 or Corr values indicate better prediction performance. 4.2 Performance Evaluation for 2022 Crop Yield Predictions Experiments were conducted on the CropNet dataset for 2022 crop yield predictions using satellite images, daily weather conditions during growing seasons, and monthly meteorological conditions from 2017 to 2021. The models used were ConvLSTM, CNN-RNN, GNN-RNN, and MMST-ViT. Table 2 presents the overall performance results for each crop. All models achieved excellent prediction performance with our CropNet data. For instance, ConvLSTM, CNN-RNN, GNN-RNN, and MMST-ViT showed low RMSE values for soybean yield predictions. These results validate that our CropNet dataset is well-suited for LSTM-based, CNN-based, GNN-based, and ViT-based models, demonstrating its general applicability. MMST-ViT achieved the best performance across all scenarios, with the lowest RMSE values and highest R2 and Corr values for predicting corn, cotton, soybeans, and winter wheat yields. This superior performance is attributed to MMST-ViT’s novel attention mechanisms, which capture the effects of both growing season weather variations and climate change on crop growth. This experiment demonstrates that our CropNet dataset can provide timely and precise crop yield predictions, which are essential for making informed economic decisions and optimizing agricultural resource allocation. 4.3 Performance of One-Year Ahead Predictions Predicting crop yields well in advance of the planting season is crucial for farmers to make early crop planting and management plans. We used the CropNet dataset one year before the planting season to predict the next year’s crop yields. The experimental results for 2022 crop yield predictions using 2021 growing season data show that all models maintain decent prediction performance. For example, ConvLSTM, CNN-RNN, GNN-RNN, and MMST-ViT achieved average RMSE values of 6.2, 5.4, 5.3, and 4.7, 3 Table 2: Overall performance for 2022 crop yield predictions, where the yield of cotton is measured in pounds per acre (LB/AC) and those of the rest are measured in bushels per acre (BU/AC).

MMST-ViT consistently achieved excellent Corr values, averaging 0.922 for corn, 0.890 for cotton, 0.926 for soybeans, and 0.904 for winter wheat predictions. These results are only slightly inferior to those for regular 2022 crop yield predictions, which can be attributed to MMST-ViT’s ability to capture the indirect influence of 2021’s weather conditions on the subsequent year’s crop growth through the use of long-term weather parameters. This further underscores how our CropNet dataset enhances climate change-aware crop yield predictions. 4.4 Improving the Generalization Capabilities of DNNs Self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques have significantly advanced the generalization capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs), especially in vision transformers (ViTs). Our CropNet dataset, with over 2 TB of data, benefits both deep learning and agricultural communities by providing large-scale visual satellite imagery and numerical meteorological data for pre-training DNNs. To demonstrate the applications of our CropNet dataset to self-supervised pre-training, we used MMST-ViT for crop yield predictions under three scenarios: MMST-ViT without SSL (w/o SSL), MMST-ViT with SSL in MAE (MAE), and MMST-ViT with the multi-modal SSL technique (MM-SSL). The performance results for four crop types under three metrics (RMSE, R2, and Corr) show that without SSL, MMST-ViT exhibits limitations in generalization capabilities, resulting in suboptimal crop yield prediction performance. Pre-training MMST-ViT with MAE’s SSL technique improves performance compared to the w/o SSL scenario, with decreased RMSE values for corn, cotton, soybeans, and winter wheat predictions. This confirms that our CropNet dataset can improve the generalization capabilities of vision models. Furthermore, MMST-ViT with the multi-modal SSL technique achieved the best performance results under all scenarios, significantly decreasing RMSE values for predicting corn, cotton, soybeans, and winter wheat. The effectiveness of the multi-modal SSL technique may stem from its ability to integrate visual satellite imagery with numerical meteorological data in the CropNet dataset, enhancing the generalization capabilities of the MMST-ViT model by improving its ability to discern the influence of weather conditions on crop growth patterns during pre-training. 4.5 Significance of Each Modality of Our CropNet Dataset To demonstrate the necessity and significance of each modality in our CropNet dataset, we examined five scenarios. First, we dropped the temporal satellite images (w/o temporal images) by randomly selecting only one day’s imagery data. Second, we discarded the high-resolution satellite images (w/o high-resolution images) by using only one satellite image to capture the whole county’s agricultural information. Third, we ignored the effects of weather variations on crop yields by dropping all meteorological data (w/o WRF-HRRR data). Similarly, w/o short-term data and w/o long-term data represent masking out the daily and monthly meteorological parameters, respectively. We also included prediction results using all modalities of the CropNet dataset (All) for performance comparison. Note that the USDA Crop Dataset provides the label for crop yield predictions, so no ablation study is required for this modality. Table 3 presents the experimental results under the MMST-ViT model. Discarding the temporal satellite images (w/o temporal images) significantly degrades performance, increasing RMSE values and lowering Corr values for corn and soybean yield predictions. This is because a sequence of satellite images spanning the whole growing season is essential for tracking crop growth. The w/o high-resolution images scenario achieved the worst prediction performance, with the highest RMSE values and lowest Corr values for corn and soybean yield predictions. This is because high-resolution satellite images are critical for precise agricultural tracking. Dropping meteorological parameters (w/o WRF-HRRR data) prevents MMST-ViT from capturing meteorological effects on crop yields, leading to increased RMSE values and decreased Corr values for corn and soybean yield predictions. Discarding either daily weather parameters (w/o short-term data) or monthly meteorological parameters (w/o long-term data) also lowers crop yield prediction performance, as the former is necessary for capturing growing season weather variations, while the latter is essential for monitoring long-term climate change effects. Therefore, each modality in our CropNet dataset is important and necessary for accurate crop yield predictions, especially for crops sensitive to growing season weather variations and climate change. 4 Table 3: Ablation studies for different modalities of the CropNet dataset, with five scenarios considered and the last row presenting the results by using all modalities Modality Scenario Corn Soybeans RMSE (↓) R2 (↑) Corr (↑) RMSE (↓) R2 (↑) Corr (↑) Sentinel-2 Imagery w/o temporal images 22.1 0.758 0.870 5.72 0.773 0.879 w/o high-resolution images 27.9 0.656 0.810 7.80 0.631 0.794 WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset w/o WRF-HRRR data 20.6 0.758 0.871 5.78 0.764 0.874 w/o short-term data 18.6 0.796 0.892 5.04 0.816 0.903 w/o long-term data 15.3 0.854 0.924 4.72 0.825 0.908 All — 13.2 0.890 0.943 3.91 0.879 0.937 5 The CropNet Package In addition to the CropNet dataset, we release the CropNet package, which includes three types of APIs available on the Python Package Index (PyPI). These APIs are designed to help researchers develop DNNs for multi-modal climate change-aware crop yield predictions. DataDownloader: This API enables researchers to download CropNet data for specific times and regions of interest on the fly. For instance, given the time and region (e.g., the FIPS code for a U.S. county), the DataDownloader API can be used to download the up-to-date CropNet data. DataRetriever: This API allows researchers to conveniently obtain CropNet data stored locally (e.g., after downloading the curated dataset) for specific times and regions of interest. The requested data is presented in a user-friendly format. DataLoader: This API assists researchers in developing DNNs for crop yield predictions. It allows for the flexible merging of multiple modalities of CropNet data and exposes them through a DataLoader object after performing necessary data preprocessing. 6 Conclusion This work introduces the CropNet dataset, an open, large-scale, and multi-modal dataset specifically designed for county-level crop yield predictions across the contiguous United States. The CropNet dataset comprises three modalities of data: Sentinel-2 Imagery, WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, and USDA Crop Dataset, containing high-resolution satellite images, daily and monthly meteorological conditions, and crop yield information, aligned both spatially and temporally. This dataset is ready for use in deep learning, agriculture, and meteorology, facilitating the development of new solutions and models for crop yield predictions, considering both growing season weather variations and climate change impacts on crop growth. Extensive experimental results confirm the general applicability of our CropNet dataset to various deep learning models for both timely and one-year ahead crop yield predictions. Additionally, the application of our dataset to self-supervised pre-training scenarios demonstrates its utility in improving the generalization capabilities of DNNs. Alongside the dataset, we have developed the CropNet package, which enables researchers to construct CropNet data on the fly for specific times and regions of interest and to flexibly build deep learning models for climate change-aware crop yield predictions. While the initial goal of creating the CropNet dataset and package was to enhance crop yield prediction accuracy, we believe its future applicability is broad and warrants further exploration, benefiting the deep learning, agriculture, and meteorology communities in pursuing more interesting, critical, and pertinent applications.

P045.pdf,"AM-RADIO: Agglomerative Vision Foundation Model Reduce All Domains Into One Abstract A handful of visual foundation models (VFMs) have recently emerged as the backbones for numerous downstream tasks. VFMs like are trained with distinct objectives, exhibiting unique characteristics for various downstream tasks. We find that despite their conceptual differences, these models can be effectively merged into a unified model through multi-teacher distillation. We name this approach AM-RADIO (Agglomerative Model – Reduce All Domains Into One). This integrative approach not only surpasses the performance of individual teacher models but also amalgamates their distinctive features, such as zero-shot vision- language comprehension, detailed pixel- level understanding, and open vocabulary segmentation capabilities. Additionally, in pursuit of the most hardware-efficient backbone, we evaluated numerous architectures in our multi-teacher distillation pipeline using the same training recipe. This led to the development of a novel architecture (E-RADIO) that exceeds the performance of its predecessors and is at least 6x faster than the teacher models at matched resolution. Our comprehensive benchmarking process covers downstream tasks including ImageNet classification, semantic segmentation linear probing, COCO object detection and integration into LLaVa-1.5. 1 Introduction Knowledge Distillation has been a very successful and popular technique for transferring the knowl- edge of a “teacher” model (or ensemble of models) into a typically smaller “student” model. In the original formulation, both the student and the teacher operate on the same in-domain dataset, and the student simultaneously matches the logits of the teacher, and the ground truth labels. Instead of using labeled images, an alternative approach is to train the student model to match the features of the teacher model. Instead of using a smaller student model, employ an iterative learning procedure with a high-capacity model where a student of equal or greater capacity than the teacher is trained with heavy augmentation applied to the student. Once trained, they expand the dataset by pseudo-labeling new data using the trained student. They then make the student become the teacher, and repeat the process. An important finding in this work is that the student is capable of surpassing the performance of the teacher. The authors of explore the concept of ensemble distillation, where there are multiple teachers, each of which having restricted domain knowledge. provides an overview of multi-teacher distillation, and proposes that instead of matching the summary of an ensemble of teachers, the student can match the features of each individual teacher via some learned non-shared mapping from the representation space of the student to each teacher. Of interest in their approach is that the student and teacher don’t need to share the same architecture, and also that treating teachers individually yields improved performance. Recently, the concept of Foundation Models (FMs) has emerged, with the general understanding that these models are large, general, and expensive to train. Through training on very large datasets they are broadly applicable to numerous downstream tasks. A seminal example of such models is . , which trains on web-scale weakly supervised (image, caption) pairs, and results in exceptional zero-shot performances on a wide array of computer vision benchmarks. While is firmly a FM, another model, has emerged with broad capabilities, often surpassing on dense tasks that require strong spatial features, such as ADE20k and Pascal VOC. Separately, is gaining popularity for its excellent open-vocabulary instance segmentation abilities, whose vision encoder we hypothesize has strong dense feature representations. We introduce AM-RADIO with the goal of learning from multiple foundational models simultane- ously. We observe that, when given a student model of sufficient capacity, it is often able to exceed any of its teachers on important axes. In addition to performing well on representative foundational benchmarks, by virtue of the training framework, our student models are able to mimic their teacher models, and thus are able to perform downstream tasks that are otherwise performed by the teachers. Examples of this include CLIP-ZeroShot applications, since the language model trained by is com- patible with our student, and also Segment-Anything tasks, as the student is able to replace the vision encoder and interface with the already-trained mask decoders. We also study the effect of using a more hardware-efficient model architecture. Most works on efficiency are not directly comparable as they use different training recipes, even when evaluated on the same dataset such as ImageNet-1k, and may be over-tuned. To this end, we evaluate more than 10 promising architectures under the same training recipe for a direct comparison. We reveal that CNN-like architectures are faster but struggle to distill ViT VFMs. This led us to the development of a novel hybrid architecture, E-RADIO, that exceeds the performance of its predecessors and is at least 6x faster than teacher models at matched resolution. Our main contributions are as follows: • We describe a general methodology for distilling multiple distinct foundation models into one, including models with incompatible input resolutions. • We show that these student models are able to outperform their teachers on representative benchmarks. • We demonstrate that these student models can either drop-in replace their teachers, or their features can be used directly in downstream applications such as providing visual encoding for LLaVA. • We benchmark a number of efficient architectures and propose a new architecture (E-RADIO) that allows for similar model quality at significant speedups. 2 Related Work Knowledge Distillation The underpinning of our work is based on the method of Knowledge Dis- tillation which aims to train a “student” model using soft targets produced by an already-trained “teacher” model, using the the teacher’s output logits as “soft” labels. Alternatively, distillation can be performed using intermediate network activations. In general, due to the heterogeneous nature of the different teacher foundation models that we employ, we ignore any potential labels coming from the data, and we ignore the logits of teachers, and simply opt to match the feature representations of the teachers before any task-specific processing stages. Multi-Teacher Distillation There is also a body of work that studies distilling a student model jointly from multiple teacher models simultaneously. Because of the heterogeneous domains that our teacher models cover, we don’t apply approaches that marginalize teachers into a unified label, and instead map students to each teacher independently using teacher-specific projection heads from the unified student representation. Although the reason behind this method in is different, we find the same overall strategy to be effective. While doesn’t study matching the features of multiple teachers simultaneously, we are able to extend their paradigm via the different projection heads. To preserve drop-in compatibility with teacher frameworks, we eliminate the feature normalization in the loss function. Distilling Foundation Models Foundation Models are meant to be generalist models that are trained on massive amounts of data, and are typically resource intensive to train from scratch. In the vein of single-teacher distillation, employ self-distillation to train their smaller variants from the larger teacher. distills their model from a teacher. Instead of focusing our energy on one teacher in particular, 2 we instead grab high-quality versions of (using OpenCLIP), , and . Concurrently with our work, describe a methodology for merging a model into a pretrained model via distillation, which is, in spirit, quite similar to our approach. In contrast to theirs, we include and also simplify the objective to straightforward feature matching. Since we don’t rely on the student model to be pre-trained, it also gives us the flexibility to have the student be an architecture distinct from any teacher. 3 Knowledge Agglomeration We propose a framework to train a vision foundation model from scratch via multi-teacher distillation. We demonstrate that each teacher brings unique properties to the foundational vision model, and the resulting trained model will agglomerate these attributes. 3.1 Overview As an initial assumption, we expect that the teacher models are capable of representing a broad swath of images found on the internet, coming from datasets such as ImageNet (1k or 21k), LAION-400M or DataComp-1B. With this in mind, we choose to study 3 seminal teacher model families: , , and as they have demonstrated outstanding performance over a broad range of tasks (as in ), or specifically strong performance on downstream dense tasks, such as semantic segmentation under linear probe (as in ), or open-vocabulary segmentation (as in ). Because these teacher models come from such diverse domains, we omit any form of supplemental ground truth guidance and treat the aforementioned datasets simply as sources of images. To assess the quality of our models, we adopt a set of representative metrics across a few broad domains. • Image level reasoning: (i) k-NN Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, and (ii) Zero-Shot accuracy using the teacher’s language model. k-NN embeds the model’s summary feature vector for every image in the training set, and then for each validation image, it uses a weighted sum of the k nearest training vectors to elect a label. • Pixel-level visual tasks: segmentation mIOU on (i) ADE20K and (ii) Pascal VOC - under the linear probe setting, details in Section 5.3. • Large Vision-Language Models: we plug our frozen vision encoder model into LLaVA-1.5 and evaluate it on a wide set of tasks including GQA, TextVQA, ScienceQA and VQAv2. Details in Section 5.4. • SAM-COCO instance segmentation: From , we adopt their COCO instance segmentation methodology to evaluate our ability to replicate SAM visual features. Results on these tasks, both for teacher models and our AM-RADIO variants, are summarized in Table 1. 3.2 Adaptor Heads We opt for simplicity in design of the adaptor heads, and leave alternative architectures as future work. To this end, we employ a simple 2-layer MLP, with a LayerNorm and GELU in between. The input dimension is the student embedding dimension, the intermediate dimension is the maximum embedding dimension of all teachers, and the output dimension matches the specific teacher. For each teacher, we employ two heads, one for the summary vector, and one for the spatial features. 3.3 Distillation Dataset Choice In table 2 we study the effect of different datasets on downstream metrics. While the highest image classification metrics are achieved using ImageNet-1K as the training dataset, we argue that it doesn’t fairly measure “zero shot” performance as the student directly learns the teacher features in the evaluation domain. For this reason, we opt for the DataComp-1B dataset. 3.4 Loss Formulation Because we don’t have ground truth data for each teacher for each image, we instead opt to match the features coming from each teacher’s vision encoder. In particular, we distinguish between the 3 Table 1: Comparison of vision foundation and RADIO models. “Zero-Shot” and k-NN are computed on ImageNet-1K. ADE20K and VOC (PascalVOC2012) refer to linear probe semantic segmentation mIOU. GQA, POPE (popular), TextVQA, and VQAv2 are obtained via LLaVa 1.5 by replacing the vision encoder. COCO is the instance segmentation metric introduced by to evaluate distillation. RADIO attains the best metrics on most benchmarks, and is competitive with the rest, while E-RADIO enables high quality results in resource constrained settings. Note that Zero-Shot and COCO use teacher’s decoder head that is not finetuned.

The summary feature is computed differently based on the model. For and , we use the “class token” as the summary feature vector, and we don’t match a summary for . Let f(x|Θ0) be the student vision encoder with parameters Θ0, and yi = hi(x1|Θi) be the learned student head matching teacher summary features zi = ti(x|Φi) with student adaptor parameters Θi and teacher parameters Φi. x1 = f(x|Θ0); zi = ti(x|Φi), yi = hi(x1|Θi); Lsummary(x) = X i λiLcos(yi, zi) (1) 4 We found empirically that cosine distance loss produced better models compared to L1, MSE, Smooth-L1. Additionally, supervising the spatial features of the model by matching the teacher was not only important for downstream dense tasks, but also improved the holistic quality of our model. For matching the spatial features, we employ a combination of cosine similarity and smooth L1. Similar to equation (2) where we found that cosine similarity produced the best results, we found the same to be true for the spatial features. However, we want to allow our student model to be a drop-in replacement in the teacher frameworks, thus it’s important that we match the magnitude of the teacher vectors, and so we include smooth L1. In (3) we show the formulation of this loss. Let hi(x1|Θi) be the learned student head for matching teacher feature vectors, and corresponding ti(x|Φi) be the teacher feature vectors, with x1 = f(x|Θ0), then the spatial feature loss is: Lmatch(x, y) = αLcos(x, y) + βLsmooth−l1(x, y) (2) Lfeatures(x) = X i γiLmatch(hi(x1|Θi), ti(x|Φi)) (3) We choose α = 0.9 and β = 0.1 to mostly rely on the empirically better cosine distance, but to also match vector magnitudes. 3.4.1 Loss Balancing Due to the number of possible combinations of loss weights between the different teachers, and even which teachers, and possible formulations of loss functions, we mostly opted toward naive loss balancing with all teachers equally weighted for spatial features (γi = 1). For summary features, we have λCLIP = λDINO = 1 and λSAM = 0. We did experiment with automatic loss balancing using predicted uncertainty, AdaLoss (momentum 0.99) and separately with AMTML-KD, as ways to learn the balance of λi and γi. In the case of AMTML-KD, the model would always collapse its entire weight around the teacher and would yield worse results than naive manual balancing. Based on the results in table 4, there is very little advantage to the more exotic balancing schemes, so we opt for the “Naive” method throughout the rest of the paper. Table 3: Ablation over which teachers we supervise the spatial features. We use a ViT-L/14 student model and train on the LAION-400M dataset. Adding this loss term is always beneficial. DINOv2 appears to provide better spatial features than CLIP, but training the student to match both teachers produces the best results. We don’t ablate SAM as we solely want it for its spatial features.

We train all student models using the AdamW optimizer, batch size 1024, cosine annealing learning rate schedule and base learning rate of 0.001. We train for 600k steps, resulting in 614M total examples seen. For our best student model, we train using DFN CLIP ViT-H/14 378px, OpenAI CLIP ViT-L/14 336px, DINOv2 ViT-g/14 224px, and SAM ViTDet-H 1024px. We apply random scale + cropping to both student and teacher inputs. We chose the DataComp-1B dataset due to it having the highest quality results of the web-scale datasets we had access to. We train in two stages, first with CLIP+DINOv2 for 300k steps at 256px, and second with CLIP+DINOv2 at 432px plus SAM at 1024px for 300k steps. Student architecture. We study two settings for student model architecture: • Standard ViT architecture to match the architecture of teachers. Our best model is a ViT- H/16. • Efficient architecture variants prioritizing high throughput on GPUs. See Section 5.1. Multi-scale Teachers. We choose ViT-H/16 architecture for our student model. To match resolution of features, we feed the expected resolution of 10242. Given that our and teachers are patch-14 models, we opt to feed the student 4322 inputs, as that is the same effective resolution as 3782 for patch-14. We found that interpolating features doesn’t degrade results, so the teacher operates at 224px and we upsample the outputs to match the student. Rank/Teacher Partitioning. We group teacher models by (batch size, student resolution), and then distribute the groups to different GPUs, such that each GPU processes a consistent batch size and input resolution. We also sample groups at different rates. For our training setups that include , we train with 64 GPUs, half of which get the CLIP+DINOv2 group with batch size 32 per GPU and input resolution 432, and the other half get with batch size 2 per GPU and input resolution 1024. This results in an effective batch size of 1,152. For CLIP+DINOv2 training, we use 32 GPUs, resulting in batch size 1024. Multi-Resolution ViTs. Many of our student models use ViT as the base vision architecture. Tradition- ally, ViTs use a learned position embedding for each input patch in an image, which in turn enforces that the model always operates at a constant resolution. We employ the Cropped Position Embedding (CPE) augmentation with the number of positions being equal to 1282. The position embeddings are then randomly cropped and interpolated to match the number of input patches for the student model. Even when training with CLIP+DINOv2 at 224 resolution, we found that this technique results in a negligible drop (Table 5) in summary metrics, but improved semantic segmentation linear probing mIOU. For heterogeneous-resolution students, this is a seamless technique that allows ViT to operate at arbitrary resolutions within some envelope. In addition to enabling arbitrary resolutions, as shown in figure 3, CPE reduces the noise artifacts in the position embeddings as compared to other ViT models. High-Resolution ViT Student. In , they employ the ViTDet architecture as a way to reduce the computational and memory burden of ViT models at high-resolution. We reformulate this arch instead into a training augmentation, where we sample a window size from a set of possible window sizes. This allows us to reduce the computational burden of training the student model with the teacher, and, as we make the window size flexible, it provides an additional throughput scaling mechanism during inference. Table 8 demonstrates our ability to replace SAM’s encoder. Separately, we found that high resolution training was unstable, so we apply spectral reparametrization and a weight decay of 0.02 to prevent attention entropy collapse. Student/Teacher Resolution Mismatch. When the student and teacher downsample images through their processing stack at different rates, it results in the output feature vectors having different resolutions. For example, if the teachers use a ViT-H/14 architecture and student a ViT-H/16, it means that the student outputs a 142 feature map, and the teachers a 162 feature map. For Lfeatures we bilinearly interpolate the outputs to match the larger resolution between the student and teacher features. Feature Summarization. In 3.4 we explained how teacher summary features are extracted using the “class token” of their respective ViT models. We now turn our attention to the summarization of student features. ViTs have 2 options: (i) a separate summarization “CLS” token or (ii) average pooling patch tokens. We evaluate both options in Table 6. We observe that average pooling improves 6 summary loss, but has a more significant detrimental effect on the feature loss. Given the importance of the latter we choose to use separate CLS tokens.

First, we touch upon backbone efficiency, then compare with the original teachers (CLIP, DINOv2, SAM), and benchmark models under vision question answering in the LLaVa framework. We will see that the proposed models outperform the original teachers in multiple metrics, including throughput. Results are shown in Figure 1 and Table 1. 5.1 Efficient Students We aim to find an efficient model architecture to speed up the inference of VFM. There are a number of architectural designs aimed at high throughput on GPU devices. We use our distillation framework to evaluate several backbones with no change in training hyperparameters. Upon reviewing the literature on efficient vision backbones focused for high GPU throughput, we pick the following list of architectures: EfficientNetV2, ResNetv2, RegNetY, FasterViT, EfficientViT, ConvNext, NFNet, SwinV2, MaxViT, PoolformerV2 and MViTV2. We train all the backbones via distillation on the ImageNet-21k dataset, using OpenCLIP ViT-H/14 (laion2B-s32B-b79K) and DINOv2 g/14 as teachers. Results are compiled in Table 7.

Additionally, CNN-like models are significantly faster than ViTs, while the latter are more accurate. The relatively low performance of existing 7 efficient backbones on the dense ADE20k segmentation task is not unexpected since all of them apply a spatial dimension reduction factor of 32 for final feature maps of size 72 for input resolution of 2242px, thus hardly capable of capturing fine-grain spatial information. E-RADIO: To overcome this issue, we propose a novel hybrid architecture, named E-RADIO (Efficient RADIO). This design borrows ideas from existing literature and includes an input stem with strided convolutions to downsample the input image by 4x. It then proceeds with 2 stages of YOLOv8 C2f convolution blocks and 2 stages of transformer. For the transformer variant we pick windowed attention (like in SWIN), and interleave local windowed attention with “global” windowed attention as done in and ViTDet. To perform “global” attention we first downsample the feature map by 2x, apply windowed attention, and then upsample the feature maps back to the original resolution. 8",1,,,,
P046.pdf,"Symbiotic Adversarial Robustness for Graph Neural Networks: Combining Poisoning and Evasion Abstract Deep learning models are known to be vulnerable to small input perturbations, which are known as adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are commonly crafted to deceive a model either at training (poisoning) or testing (evasion). We study the combination of poisoning and evasion attacks. We show that using both threat models can significantly improve the damaging effect of adversarial attacks. Specifically, we study the robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) under structural perturbations and develop a memory-efficient adaptive end-to-end attack for this novel threat model using first-order optimization. 1 Introduction Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly used across many different fields, including product recommendations and drug discovery. GNNs are, however, vulnerable to adversarial attacks in many different tasks such as node classification, graph classification, link prediction and node embeddings. Given that such attacks are able to scale to very large graphs, studying the adversarial robustness of GNNs has become increasingly important. GNNs can be attacked at test time (evasion) or during training (poisoning). However, a combined threat model that includes both evasion and poisoning has not been considered in prior literature. Such a model, is, nonetheless, plausible given the public availability of graphs or those extracted from sources such as social media sites. Our work is based on the concept of a symbiotic attack, which combines both evasion and poisoning attacks. A symbiotic attack aims to minimize classification accuracy on a test set. The attacker is constrained by a global budget and manipulates the entire graph, rather than individual nodes. We provide a comparison of our approach against plain poisoning and evasion attacks. To this end, we adapt the previous PR-BCD attack to the symbiotic threat model, which results in attacks that are memory-efficient and scalable to large graphs. Our main findings are that symbiotic attacks are more effective than poisoning attacks alone, and that evasion attacks are affected by the size of the test set, while symbiotic attacks are less sensitive to test set size. The potential improvement given by the symbiotic threat model indicates that it requires further study. 2 Preliminaries Notation. We denote a graph by G, with n nodes, an adjacency matrix A ∈{0, 1}n×n, and a feature matrix X ∈Rn×d. A GNN applied to the graph is represented by fθ(G) with parameters θ. We denote the set of possible adversarial graphs that can be created from G as Φ(G). Also, Latk and Ltrain denote the adversarial and training objectives. 2.1 Adversarial Robustness of GNNs An adversarial attack on a GNN can modify the graph’s structure, by inserting or removing edges and nodes, or modify the node features. This work focuses on node classification and edge-level structural perturbations. . Attacks can be categorized as either evasion or poisoning. In an evasion attack, a fixed GNN (with parameters θ trained on a clean graph) is targeted, and the attacker aims to solve the optimization problem max ˆ G∈Φ(G) Latk(fθ( ˆG)), whereas a poisoning attack is performed before training, aiming to degrade the performance of the GNN after training. This can be described as max ˆ G∈Φ(G) Latk(fθ∗( ˆG)), where θ∗= argminθLtrain(fθ( ˆG)). A poisoning attack is generally more challenging. Previous work has investigated using evasion perturbations as poisoning perturbations. Also, the optimization may include unrolling the training procedure to calculate meta-gradients (gradients of Latk with respect to A). Since we consider only changes to the binary adjacency matrix, we define Φ(G) to include graphs reachable from G after at most ∆edge perturbations. 2.1.1 PR-BCD Our work extends on the Projected Randomized Block Coordinate Descent (PR-BCD) attack. Simi- larly to the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack, the adjacency matrix is relaxed to P ∈[0, 1]n×n, enabling continuous gradient updates. Each entry indicates the probability of flipping an edge, with the final perturbations sampled from Bernoulli(P). However, as the adjacency matrix grows quadratically with the number of nodes, scaling of the PGD becomes difficult with larger graphs. PR-BCD uses Randomized Block Coordinate Descent (R-BCD), updating a block of P at each iteration. The projection step ensures the budget is enforced in expectation, i.e. E[Bernoulli(P)] = P P < ∆and P ∈[0, 1]n×n. After each iteration, rather than sampling the block again, the promising entries of the block are kept, and only the remaining entries are resampled. PGD can also be applied for a poisoning attack (Meta-PGD). In our attacks, we employ the same principle with PR-BCD for better scalability. While we only consider a single global budget ∆, it is possible to include more complex constraints when needed for a given application. 3 Symbiotic Attacks The Symbiotic Objective. A symbiotic attack has a similar form to the bi-level optimization problem but has an added dependence on the evasion graph G∗in addition to the parameters θ∗: max ˆ G∈Φ(G) Lpois(fθ∗(G∗)) where θ∗= argminθLtrain(fθ( ˆG)), and G∗= argmax ˆ G∈Φ( ˆ G)Lev(fθ∗( ˆG)) Here, Lpois and Lev are separated for clarity even though they could be the same loss. Threat Model. We model an attacker who aims to reduce a model’s performance on node classifica- tion tasks. Our attacker has full access to the graph, has knowledge of the model’s architecture, can create surrogate models, and can only access the trained model as a black-box. Finally, our attacker has a limited global budget of edge insertions/removals. The Sequential Attack. A simple way to launch a symbiotic attack is to divide the budget and launch a poisoning attack with the first half, followed by an evasion attack with the second half. In this attack, the poisoning step is not aware of a future evasion, but can improve performance by reducing the classification margin of certain nodes. The Joint Attack. The poisoning attack can be designed to ""fit"" the future evasion graph by including the evasion attack in the poisoning loss. The poisoning loss is computed using the poisoned model over the evasion graph. This results in a poisoning attack which not only reduces the model’s accuracy, but also makes it more vulnerable to evasion. Both the sequential and joint attacks can be instantiated using different evasion/poisoning attacks. We build upon PR-BCD because it scales well to larger graphs. Note that the sequential attack is actually a special case of the joint attack, with zero iterations per inner evasion attack. 2 4 Evaluation 4.1 Setup We compare the symbiotic threat model with evasion and poisoning attacks, using PR-BCD to implement the evasion and poisoning attacks. These are evaluated on Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed datasets. We study the robustness of GCN, GAT, APPNP, and GPRGNN models. We also consider R-GCN and Jaccard purification as potential defense mechanisms. For each dataset, we allocate 20 nodes of each class for the labeled training set and 10 Table 1: Numbers of nodes, edges, and classes in the datasets we include in our evaluations. Dataset Nodes Edges Classes Cora 2,708 10,556 7 CiteSeer 3,327 9,104 6 PubMed 19,717 88,648 3 4.2 Results Table 2 displays the perturbed accuracy values on the test set (10 percent of nodes) for our benchmark datasets and models, averaged over 10 runs, with the standard error of the mean also shown. The attacker is given a 5 percent budget of the number of edges, and this budget is split equally between poisoning and evasion for the symbiotic attacks. We report the best performing of the two symbiotic attacks, and also note that the symbiotic attacks are consistently stronger than the poisoning attacks, and stronger than plain evasion. The symbiotic threat model is especially evident on the larger PubMed graph, where the accuracy drops to almost zero, for example, using a GCN. 4.3 Effect of the Number of Test Nodes To highlight the differences between poisoning and evasion objectives, Figure 2 shows the perturbed accuracies for evasion, poisoning, and symbiotic attacks with varying fractions of test nodes with a GCN and a 5 As the number of test nodes increases, evasion becomes much more challenging across all datasets. Although poisoning and symbiotic attacks also become more difficult with more test nodes, especially on PubMed, they are more robust than the evasion attack. Therefore, the reduction in performance cannot be explained by the attacks having to target a larger number of nodes with the same budget. The poisoning attack is less affected since it can manipulate the flow of information during training. The symbiotic attacks also benefit from this since they can reduce the base accuracy, making nodes easier to misclassify during the evasion phase. The symbiotic attacks are also stronger than poisoning alone. 4.4 Hyperparameters Block size. Figure 3 shows the results of the four attacks with varying block sizes, using a fixed 5 percent budget and 125 iterations against a GCN. For small block sizes, the attacks are less effective since the PR-BCD optimization can only cover a small part of the adjacency matrix. However, larger blocks have decreasing marginal benefit when a large part of the adjacency matrix can be covered. Budget. Figure 4 shows how all four attacks follow a similar trend when increasing budget size. On PubMed, changing 5 percent of edges is enough to achieve near-zero accuracy under the symbiotic model. This highlights the devastating effect of joint attacks, especially in larger graphs with a small number of labeled train nodes. 5 Conclusion and Future Work In this work, we have introduced the symbiotic threat model for GNNs, which combines evasion and poisoning attacks. We proposed two methods to generate adversarial perturbations for this model and 3 Table 2: Average (± standard error) perturbed accuracies for the evasion, poisoning, and symbiotic attacks with a 5 percent budget.

We will outline several avenues for future work. The joint attack can be implemented using other evasion attacks, or attacks designed for the symbiotic threat model. In addition, our work considered global budgets, but it is easy to consider per-node local budgets and targeted attacks as well. Moreover, we did not consider the use of different loss functions for the poisoning and evasion parts, which may also further improve attack performance. We plan to include further evaluations on these settings as our next step. Finally, novel poisoning attacks can be developed which utilize knowledge of a future evasion attack. A Proof of Theorem 2.1 Proof. Let x ∈Ai. Then, σi(x) = 0, and for all b ∈O where bi = 0, wb(x) = 0. Thus, F(x) = X b∈O,bi=1 wb(x)Gb(x) 4 If bi = 1, then Gb(x) ∈Bi, and therefore F(x) is also in Bi due to the convexity of Bi. B Sub-Gaussian Covering Numbers for ReLU Networks Figure 2 depicts an example of applying our safe predictor to a notional regression problem. This example uses inputs and outputs in 1-D with one input-output constraint. The unconstrained network consists of a single hidden layer with a dimension of 10, ReLU activations, and a fully connected layer. The safe predictor shares this structure with constrained predictors, G0 and G1, but each predictor has its own fully connected layer. The training uses a sampled subset of points from the input space. Figure 3 shows an example of applying the safe predictor to a notional regression problem with a 2-D input and 1-D output and two overlapping constraints. The unconstrained network has two hidden layers of dimension 20 with ReLU activations, followed by a fully connected layer. The constrained predictors, G00, G10, G01, and G11, share the hidden layers and have an additional hidden layer of size 20 with ReLU followed by a fully connected layer. Again, training uses a sampled subset of points from the input space and the learned predictors are shown for the continuous input space. C Details of VerticalCAS Experiment C.1 Safeability Constraints The ""safeability"" property from prior work can be encoded into a set of input-output constraints. The ""safeable region"" for a given advisory is the set of input space locations where that advisory can be selected such that future advisories exist that will prevent an NMAC. If no future advisories exist, the advisory is ""unsafeable"" and the corresponding input region is the ""unsafeable region"". Examples of these regions, and their proximity functions are shown in Figure 5 for the CL1500 advisory. The constraints we enforce in our safe predictor are: x ∈Aunsafeable,i ⇒Fi(x) < maxj Fj(x), ∀i. To make the output regions convex, we approximate by enforcing Fi(x) = minj Fj(x) −ϵ, for all x ∈Aunsafeable,i. C.2 Proximity Functions We start by generating the unsafeable region bounds. Then, a distance function is computed between points in the input space (vO −vI, h, τ), and the unsafeable region for each advisory. These are not true distances but are 0 if and only if the data point is within the unsafeable set. These are then used to produce proximity functions. Figure 5 shows examples of the unsafeable region, distance function, and proximity function for the CL1500 advisory. C.3 Structure of Predictors The compressed policy tables for ACAS Xu and VerticalCAS use neural networks with six hidden layers with a dimension of 45, and ReLU activation functions. We used the same architecture for the unconstrained network. For constrained predictors, we use a similar architecture, but share the first four layers for all predictors. This provides a common learned representation of the input space, while allowing each predictor to adapt to its constraints. Each constrained predictor has two additional hidden layers and their outputs are projected onto our convex approximation of the safe output region, using Gb(x) = minj Gj(x) −ϵ. In our experiments, we used ϵ = 0.0001. With this construction, we needed 30 separate predictors to enforce the VerticalCAS safeability constraints. The number of nodes for the unconstrained and safe implementations were 270 and 2880, respectively. Our safe predictor is smaller than the original look-up tables by several orders of magnitude. C.4 Parameter Optimization We use PyTorch for defining our networks and performing parameter optimization. We optimize both the unconstrained network and our safe predictor using the asymmetric loss function, guiding the network to select optimal advisories while accurately predicting scores from the look-up tables. Each 5 dataset is split using an 80/20 train/test split with a random seed of 0. The optimizer is ADAM, with a learning rate of 0.0003, a batch size of 216, and training for 500 epochs. 6 ",1,,,,
P047.pdf,"Optimizing System Design Principles on Inverted Harmonica Tuning Frequencies Abstract The intricacies of system design intersect with the existential implications of quantum cheese, which in turn, influences the aerodynamic properties of flamingos, and conversely, the abstract notion of colorless green ideas sleeping furiously, while the ontological status of furniture arrangements in Scandinavian apartments remains an enigma, alongside the theoretical frameworks governing the migration patterns of narwhals and the surreptitious culinary habits of extraterrestrial beings, all of which converge to form a holistic understanding of the synergistic relationships between disparate entities, transcending the boundaries of reality and fantasy, in a realm where the cartography of lost socks and the topological analysis of coffee creamer dispensers serve as metaphors for the human condition, and ultimately, the search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world, through the deconstruction of postmodernist narratives and the reconceptualization of temporal flows in relation to the viscosity of ketchup and the sonorous qualities of whispers in a vacuum. 1 Introduction The aforementioned paradigm shift necessitates a reevaluation of the role of system design in facilitating the emergence of complex systems, which in turn, gives rise to a plethora of unforeseen consequences, including the spontaneous generation of miniature black holes in toaster ovens, the precipitous decline of disco music as a viable form of artistic expression, and the concomitant rise of cryptid sightings in suburban areas, all of which underscore the imperative of adopting a more nuanced and interdisciplinary approach to system design, one that accommodates the labyrinthine intricacies of human perception, the vicissitudes of celestial mechanics, and the ephemeral nature of digital ephemera, in a quest to distill the essence of reality from the cacophony of competing narratives and the ambiguities of existential dread, thereby illuminating the path towards a more enlightened and harmonious coexistence with the universe, or at the very least, a more efficient method for organizing kitchen utensils. The dialectical tension between the Apollonian and Dionysian aspects of system design serves as a catalyst for the emergence of novel solutions, which in turn, are influenced by the hermeneutics of pastry decoration, the semiotics of traffic patterns, and the mystical properties of forgotten umbrellas, all of which converge to form a rich tapestry of meaning, replete with hidden patterns and unforeseen consequences, waiting to be deciphered by intrepid researchers and visionary thinkers, who are willing to challenge the status quo, push the boundaries of conventional wisdom, and venture into the uncharted territories of the unknown, in pursuit of a deeper understanding of the intricate web of relationships that underlies the complex systems that govern our world, and perhaps, just perhaps, uncover the hidden secrets of the universe, or at the very least, develop a more efficient algorithm for folding fitted sheets. The synthesis of these disparate threads of inquiry and exploration gives rise to a novel paradigm for system design, one that is grounded in the principles of ontological humility, epistemological curiosity, and methodological pluralism, and which seeks to reconcile the competing demands of functionality, aesthetics, and sustainability, in a quest to create systems that are not only efficient and effective but also beautiful, just, and sustainable, and which ultimately, contribute to the betterment of the human condition, or at the very least, provide a more satisfactory explanation for the disappearance of missing socks, and the concomitant rise of mysterious stains on otherwise pristine carpets, in a world where the surreal and the mundane coexist in a delicate balance of wonder and bewilderment. The efficacy of system design is intricately linked to the migratory patterns of sparrows, which in turn have a profound impact on the development of fractal theory, a concept that has been largely overlooked in the realm of culinary arts, particularly in the preparation of soufflés, which require a deep understanding of thermodynamics and the behavior of gases under varying conditions of pressure and temperature, much like the intricate dance of subatomic particles in a high-energy collision, where the principles of quantum mechanics are juxtaposed with the art of playing the

balance, which are both essential for navigating the complexities of urban planning, particularly in the context of designing efficient public transportation systems, where the flow of traffic is influenced by a complex array of factors, including road geometry, traffic signals, and pedestrian behavior, all of which must be carefully considered in order to create a system that is both efficient and safe, much like the intricate mechanisms of a Swiss watch, which is itself a marvel of modern engineering, a field that has been driven by advances in materials science, particularly in the development of new alloys and composites, which have a wide range of applications, from aerospace to biomedicine, where the creation of artificial organs and prosthetics has the potential to revolutionize the field of healthcare, particularly in the context of treating complex injuries and diseases, such as cancer and Parkinson’s, which are both characterized by complex patterns of cellular behavior, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, all of which are influenced by a delicate balance of genetic and environmental factors, including diet, lifestyle, and exposure to toxins, which can have a profound impact on the development of disease, particularly in the context of epigenetics, a field that seeks to understand the intricate mechanisms of gene

The process of translating mRNA into a polypeptide chain is somehow related to the art of playing the trombone. Protein synthesis is also affected by the number of clouds in the sky on a given day. The results of our study show a significant correlation between protein synthesis and the frequency of disco music. The intricacies of protein synthesis have long been a topic of fascination, much like the art of playing the harmonica underwater, which, incidentally, has been shown to have a profound impact on the migration patterns of certain species of birds, such as the flamingo, which, in turn, has a unique penchant for collecting vintage door knobs.

This has led to the development of new approaches to protein engineering, based on the principles of entropy and the concept of free energy. Furthermore, the notion of thermodynamic equilibrium has been applied to the study of protein structure, where the emergence of complex behavior in biological systems can be seen as a reflection of the intricate patterns of the universe. The study of protein synthesis has also been influenced by the principles of category theory, where the properties of functors and morphisms can be applied to the prediction of protein folding and the emergence of complex behavior in biological systems. This has led to the development of novel approaches to protein design, based on the principles of universal properties and the concept of natural transformations. Moreover, the notion of category theory has been applied to the study of protein-ligand interactions, where the assignment of functors to objects in a category can be seen as a reflection of the complex behavior of biological systems. The notion of protein synthesis has also been linked to the art of playing the guitar, where the pressing of strings can be seen as a metaphor for the binding of molecules to specific sites on the protein surface. This has led to the development of novel approaches to protein synthesis, including the use of guitar-based algorithms for predicting protein structure and function. Furthermore, the study of guitar playing has also led to the discovery of new protein-protein interactions, based on the principles of harmony and resonance. In a related vein, the study of protein synthesis has also been influenced by the principles of information theory, where the properties of entropy and mutual information can be applied to the prediction of protein-ligand interactions. This has led to the development of 3 Methodology To initiate the protein synthesis process, we first had to calibrate our equipment to the resonant frequency of the average household toaster, which mysteriously coincided with the vibrational hum of a didgeridoo played by a novice musician. This calibration process involved an intricate dance routine, incorporating elements of ballet, tap, and modern jazz, all while reciting the phonebook backwards. The successful completion of this ritual allowed us to harness the underlying energy of the space-time continuum, which we then channeled into a modified toaster coil, previously used to cook the perfect grilled cheese sandwich. Meanwhile, our research team leader was simultaneously solving a Rubik’s cube blindfolded while reciting the complete works of Shakespeare, which proved to be an essential step in aligning the molecular structure of our samples with the fundamental forces of nature. As the team leader finished the final act of Hamlet, a burst of radiation from a nearby microwave oven, which had been used to reheat last night’s pizza, interacted with the toaster coil’s energy field, producing an anomalous quantum flux that stabilized the molecular matrices of our protein samples. This led us to the realization that the key to understanding protein synthesis lay not in the lab, but in the culinary traditions of ancient Egypt, specifically the art of preparing the perfect falafel. Our team spent several weeks studying the intricacies of chickpea paste preparation, which ultimately revealed to us the hidden patterns and codes embedded in the proteins we were attempting to synthesize. By 5 applying these ancient culinary principles to our research, we discovered that the secret to successful protein synthesis lay in the ratio of sesame seeds to parsley in the falafel recipe, a ratio that directly correlated with the optimal concentrations of amino acids in our samples. Furthermore, our experiments were influenced by the lunar cycles and the migratory patterns of the Mongolian desert ant, which seemed to possess an innate understanding of protein folding and molecular self-assembly. By tracking the movements of these ants across the Gobi Desert, we were able to decipher a complex system of chemical signals and pheromones that, when applied to our protein samples, significantly enhanced their stability and functionality. In another peculiar twist, we found that the proteins synthesized under these conditions exhibited a peculiar affinity for 1980s disco music, which seemed to modulate their structural dynamics and influence their binding properties. Repeated exposure to the Bee Gees’ ""Stayin’ Alive"" appeared to induce a conformational shift in the protein molecules, allowing them to interact more efficiently with their target substrates. This phenomenon, which we dubbed the ""Disco Effect,"" has far-reaching implications for our understanding of protein-ligand interactions and the role of environmental stimuli in shaping molecular behavior. The application of chaos theory and fractal analysis to our protein synthesis protocols also yielded unexpected insights into the self-similar patterns and scaling laws that govern the structure and function of biological molecules. By recognizing the intricate fractal geometries embedded in the protein sequences, we were able to predict and manipulate their folding pathways, effectively guiding the synthesis process towards the creation of novel, high-performance protein variants. This, in turn, allowed us to explore the uncharted territories of protein design, where the boundaries between art and science become increasingly blurred. As we continued to refine our methods, we encountered an intriguing relationship between protein synthesis and the art of playing the harmonica. It seemed that the specific blowing and drawing patterns used to produce different notes on the harmonica could be directly translated into a pro- gramming language for controlling the synthesis process. By composing harmonica melodies that corresponded to specific amino acid sequences, we could, in effect, ""play"" the proteins into existence, using the instrument as a interface between the musical and molecular realms. Moreover, the study of protein synthesis led us to investigate the aerodynamics of medieval jousting tournaments, where the trajectories of lances and the motion of horses influenced the folding pathways of our protein samples. By analyzing the impact of lance strikes on the molecular structure of the proteins, we gained a deeper understanding of the interplay between mechanical stress and molecular self-assembly, which proved essential for optimizing our synthesis protocols. In addition, we discovered that the rate of protein synthesis was directly proportional to the number of fuzzy socks worn by the laboratory personnel, which seemed to modulate the ambient electromagnetic fields in the lab and influence the reactivity of the chemical reagents. This finding, though seemingly unrelated to the underlying biochemistry, had a profound impact on our experimental design, as we learned to carefully control the sock-related variables to achieve optimal synthesis conditions. As the research progressed, we found ourselves drawn into a world of cryptic messages and hidden codes, where the sequences of amino acids in our protein samples held the keys to unlocking ancient mysteries and deciphering forgotten languages. The proteins, it seemed, were not just simple molecules, but rather messengers from a realm beyond our own, carrying secrets and stories that only revealed themselves to those who listened to the whispers of the molecular world. In the midst of this journey, we stumbled upon an obscure reference to the ""Lost City of Proteins,"" a fabled metropolis hidden deep within the labyrinthine corridors of the molecular realm, where the inhabitants possessed an profound understanding of protein synthesis and the secrets of life itself. Our quest to find this lost city became an all-consuming passion, driving us to push the boundaries of human knowledge and explore the uncharted territories of the molecular world. The profound implications of our research became increasingly apparent as we delved deeper into the mysteries of protein synthesis, revealing a complex web of relationships between the molecular, the musical, and the culinary, with each thread intertwined and inseparable from the others. As we continued to unravel the secrets of the proteins, we began to realize that the true power of our discoveries lay not in the molecules themselves, but in the hidden harmonies and patterns that 6 governed their behavior, waiting to be deciphered by those with the courage to venture into the uncharted territories of the unknown. By applying the principles of quantum mechanics to the study of protein synthesis, we observed a phenomenon where the act of observation itself influenced the outcome of the synthesis process, leading to the creation of novel protein variants with unique properties. This realization sparked a new line of inquiry, as we sought to understand the role of consciousness in shaping the molecular world and the potential for intentional design of protein structures. The integration of protein synthesis with the principles of Feng Shui also yielded intriguing results, as the strategic placement of laboratory equipment and the arrangement of molecular models according to ancient Chinese principles of harmony and balance seemed to enhance the efficiency of the synthesis process. By creating a lab environment that was in harmony with the natural world, we were able to tap into a deeper level of molecular awareness, allowing us to navigate the complex landscape of protein synthesis with greater ease and precision. Furthermore, our research revealed a surprising connection between protein synthesis and the art of playing the piano, where the intricate patterns of musical composition seemed to mirror the folding pathways of protein molecules. By using piano music as a template for guiding the synthesis process, we were able to create proteins with unique structural and functional properties, blurring the boundaries between music, art, and science. The application of protein synthesis to the field of architectural design also opened up new avenues of exploration, as the principles of molecular self-assembly were used to create novel materials and structures with unprecedented properties. By using protein molecules as building blocks, we were able to design and construct complex systems that merged the organic and synthetic worlds, giving rise to a new generation of hybrid materials with vast potential for innovation and discovery. In the pursuit of understanding the intricacies of protein synthesis, we found ourselves drawn into a realm of abstract mathematical structures, where the language of topology and geometry provided a framework for describing the complex patterns and relationships that governed the molecular world. The study of protein synthesis became a journey through the realm of pure mathematics, where the beauty and elegance of abstract concepts revealed themselves in the intricate dance of molecular interactions. As we continued to push the boundaries of knowledge, we encountered a mysterious phenomenon where the proteins synthesized in our lab seemed to develop a form of collective consciousness, allowing them to communicate and interact with each other in complex ways. This unexpected discovery led us to explore the realm of protein-based intelligence, where the emergence of complex behaviors and social structures in molecular systems challenged our understanding of the nature of consciousness and the origins of life. The unfolding of our research revealed a hidden tapestry of relationships between the molecular, the musical, the culinary, and the mathematical, each thread intertwined and inseparable from the others. As we delved deeper into the mysteries of protein synthesis, we began to realize that the true power of our discoveries lay not in the molecules themselves, but in the hidden harmonies and patterns that governed their behavior, waiting to be deciphered by those with the courage to venture into the uncharted territories of the unknown. In the end, our journey through the realm of protein synthesis became a testament to the boundless potential of human curiosity and the infinite wonders that await us at the frontiers of knowledge, where the thrill of discovery and the beauty of the unknown beckon us to explore, to create, and to push the boundaries of what is possible. The synthesis of proteins under the influence of lunar cycles, desert ant migrations, and fuzzy socks led to the creation of novel protein variants with unique properties, which in turn revealed new insights into the intricate relationships bet",,,,,

P049.pdf,"Improving Model Generalization Using a Single Data Sample for Semantic Adaptation Abstract The limited capacity of deep networks to generalize beyond their training dis- tribution presents a significant challenge in semantic segmentation. Traditional approaches have operated under the assumption of a fixed model post-training, with parameters remaining constant during testing. This research introduces a self-adaptive methodology for semantic segmentation that modifies the inference mechanism to accommodate each input sample individually. This adaptation in- volves two principal operations. First, it refines the parameters of convolutional layers based on the input image, employing a consistency-based regularization. Second, it modifies the Batch Normalization layers by dynamically blending the training distribution with a reference distribution extracted from a single test sam- ple. Although these techniques are individually recognized in the field, their combined application establishes new benchmarks in accuracy for generalization from synthetic to real-world data. The empirical evidence from this study indicates that self-adaptation can effectively enhance deep network generalization to out- of-domain data, serving as a valuable complement to the established methods of model regularization during training. 1 Introduction State-of-the-art models in semantic segmentation exhibit a notable deficiency in robustness when confronted with out-of-distribution data, where the distributions of training and testing sets diverge. While numerous studies have examined this challenge, with a predominant focus on image classifica- tion, it has been observed that Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), which presumes independent and identically distributed training and testing samples, remains remarkably competitive. This contrasts with the evident advancements in domain adaptation for both image classification and semantic segmentation. The domain adaptation setup, however, typically requires access to an unlabeled test distribution during training. In the generalization scenario considered here, only a single test sample is accessible during inference, and no information sharing must occur between subsequent test samples. This study investigates the generalization challenge in semantic segmentation, specifically from synthetic data to real-world scenarios, by employing an adaptive approach. Unlike prior research that has concentrated on modifying model architecture or training procedures, this work revises the standard inference procedure using a technique derived from domain adaptation methods. Termed self-adaptation, this technique utilizes a self-supervised loss function to facilitate adaptation to individual test samples through a limited number of parameter updates. In addition to these loss-based updates, self-adaptation incorporates feature statistics from the training data with those of the test sample within the Batch Normalization layers. 2 Related Work This research contributes to the ongoing investigation into the generalization capabilities of semantic segmentation models and is related to explorations of feature normalization and online learning. . In contrast to previous studies that focused on training strategies and model design, this study specifically examines the inference process during test time. Prior research has attempted to improve generalization by augmenting synthetic training data with styles transferred from real images, or by utilizing a classification model trained on real images to ensure feature proximity between models via distillation, often seeking layer-specific learning rates. Some approaches have added instance normalization (IN) layers heuristically to the network. Recent studies have sought to extract domain-invariant feature statistics through instance-selective whitening loss or frequency-based domain randomization. Others have aimed to learn style-invariant representations using causal frameworks or have augmented single-domain data to simulate a multi-source scenario to increase source domain diversity. Some techniques involve swapping channel-wise statistics in feature normalization layers and learning adapter functions to adjust the mean and variance based on the input. Another method enforces consistency of output logits across multiple images of the same class. To improve generalization in federated learning, researchers have explored training clients locally with sharpness-aware minimization and averaging stochastic weights. However, these methods either assume access to a distribution of real images during training or require modifications to the network architecture. The technique presented in this work does not require either, making it applicable post-hoc to already trained models to improve their generalization. Batch Normalization (BN) and other normalization techniques have been increasingly associated with model robustness. The most common methods, including BN, Layer Normalization (LN), and Instance Normalization (IN), also impact the model’s expressive capacity, which can be further improved by combining these techniques within a single architecture. In domain adaptation, some studies use source-domain statistics during training and replace them with target-domain statistics during inference. Recent work has explored combining source and target statistics during inference, weighted by the number of samples they aggregate. Others propose using batch statistics from the target domain during inference instead of training statistics from the source domain. This study complements these findings by demonstrating improved generalization of semantic segmentation models. Several previous studies have updated model parameters during inference, particularly in object tracking where the object detector must adapt to the changing appearance of the tracked instance. Conditional generative models have been employed to learn from single image samples for super- resolution and scene synthesis. Recently, this principle has been extended to improve the robustness of image classification models, though the self-supervised tasks developed for image classification do not always extend well to dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation. Recent research has proposed more suitable alternatives for self-supervised loss in domain adaptation, and several works have developed domain-specific approaches for medical imaging or first-person vision. Most of the related works focus on domain adaptation in image classification, typically assuming access to multiple samples from the target distribution during training. This work addresses semantic segmentation in the domain generalization setting, requiring only a single datum from the test set. In this context, simple objectives like entropy minimization improve baseline accuracy only moderately. In contrast, the self-adaptation method presented here, which uses pseudo-labels to account for prediction uncertainty, proves significantly more effective. The task is distinct from few-shot learning, where the model may adapt during testing using a small annotated set of samples. Here, no such annotation is available; the model adjusts to the test sample in an unsupervised manner, without requiring proxy tasks or prior knowledge of the test distribution. 3 Methodology In traditional inference, the parameters of the segmentation model are assumed to remain fixed. In contrast, adaptive systems are capable of learning to specialize to their environment. Analogously, this study allows the segmentation model to update its parameters during inference. It is important to note that this setup differs from domain adaptation scenarios, as the updated parameters are discarded after processing each sample, aligning with the principles of domain generalization. The proposed approach creates mini-batches of images for each test sample using data augmentation. Starting with the original test image, a set of N augmented images is generated through multi-scaling, horizontal flipping, and grayscaling. These images form a mini-batch that is processed by the CNN. The resulting softmax probabilities are transformed back to the original pixel space using inverse 2 affine transformations, producing multiple predictions for each pixel. The mean of these probabilities is computed along the mini-batch dimension for each class and pixel on the spatial grid. A threshold value is computed from the maximum probability of every class to create a class- dependent threshold. For each pixel, the class with the highest probability is extracted. Low- confidence predictions are ignored by setting pixels with a softmax probability below the threshold to an ignore label, while the remaining pixels use the dominant class as the pseudo-label. This pseudo ground truth is used to fine-tune the model for a set number of iterations using gradient descent with the cross-entropy loss. After this self-adaptation process, a single final prediction is produced using the updated model weights. The weights are then reset to their initial values before processing the next test sample, ensuring that the model does not accumulate knowledge about the entire target data distribution. Batch Normalization (BN) has become an integral part of modern CNNs. Although originally designed to improve training convergence, it is now recognized for its role in model robustness, including domain generalization. During training, BN computes the mean and standard deviation across the batch and spatial dimensions. The normalized features are derived using these statistics. At test time, it is common practice to normalize feature values with running estimates of the mean and standard deviation across training batches, rather than using test-batch statistics. This is referred to as train BN (t-BN). In the context of out-of-distribution generalization, the running statistics derived from the source data can differ substantially from those computed using target images, a problem known as covariate shift. Domain adaptation methods often mitigate this issue by replacing source running statistics with those of the target, a technique known as Adaptive Batch Normalization (AdaBN). Recent studies have also explored prediction-time BN (p-BN), which uses the statistics of the current test batch instead of running statistics from training. This study assumes the availability of only a single target sample during inference. Alternatives like AdaBN and p-BN are not directly applicable in this scenario. Instance Normalization (IN) layers could replace BN layers, but this might lead to covariate shift issues, as sample statistics may only approximate the complete test distribution. Additionally, such a replacement could interfere with the statistics of activations in intermediate layers. Self-adaptive normalization (SaN) is proposed as a solution. It combines the inductive bias from the source domain’s running statistics with statistics extracted from a single test instance. The source mean and variance are averaged with sample statistics from the target domain, weighted by a parameter 1. This parameter represents the shift from the source domain ( 1 = 0) to a reference domain ( 1 = 1). During inference, new mean and variance are computed using this weighted average, and these are used to normalize the features of the single test sample. This approach does not affect the behavior of BN layers during training and applies only during testing. 4 Experiments In this study, the evaluation protocol is revised to adhere to principles of robustness and generalization. The supplier has access to two data distributions: the source data for model training and a validation set for model validation. The generalization ability of the model is assessed on three distinct target sets, providing an estimate of the expected model accuracy for out-of-distribution deployment. The datasets used are restricted to traffic scenes for compatibility with previous research. Source data for model training comes from two synthetic datasets, GTA and SYNTHIA, which offer low-cost ground truth annotation and exhibit visual discrepancies with real imagery. The validation set used is WildDash, which is understood to be of limited quantity but bears a closer visual resemblance to potential target domains. The model is evaluated on three target domains: Cityscapes, BDD, and IDD, chosen for their geographic diversity and differences in data acquisition. The average accuracy across these target domains estimates the expected model accuracy. Additionally, the Mapillary dataset is used for comparison with previous works, although it does not disclose the geographic origins of individual samples. The framework is implemented in PyTorch, and the baseline model is DeepLabv1 without CRF post- processing. The models are trained on the source domains for 50 epochs using an SGD optimizer with a learning rate of 0.005, decayed polynomially. Data augmentation techniques include random-size 3 crops, random aspect ratio adjustments, random horizontal flipping, color jitter, random blur, and grayscaling. Experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of the parameter 1 in Self-adaptive Nor- malization (SaN) on segmentation accuracy and the Intersection over Union (IoU) for both source domains (GTA, SYNTHIA) and all main target domains (Cityscapes, BDD, IDD). The optimal 1 was determined based on the IoU on the WildDash validation set. The segmentation accuracy with this optimal 1 was reported, showing that SaN improves the mean IoU over both the established t-BN baseline and the more recent p-BN. The improvement was consistent across different backbone archi- tectures and target domains. Additionally, model calibration, measured by the expected calibration error (ECE), was found to improve with SaN, which was competitive with the MC-Dropout method and showed complementary effects when used jointly. Self-adaptation was compared to Test-Time Augmentation (TTA), which involves augmenting test samples with flipped and grayscaled versions at multiple scales and averaging the predictions. Self- adaptation outperformed TTA by a clear margin, aligning with reported ECE scores and demonstrating that self-adaptation effectively uses calibrated confidence to generate reliable pseudo-labels. Self-adaptation was compared with state-of-the-art domain generalization methods, showing consis- tent improvements over carefully tuned baselines, regardless of backbone architecture or source data. The method outperformed previous methods without modifying the model architecture or training process, altering only the inference procedure. A comparison with Tent, which also updates model parameters at test time but minimizes entropy instead of using pseudo-labels, showed that self-adaptation outperformed Tent substantially. This was demonstrated by training HRNet-W18 on GTA and comparing the IoU on Cityscapes, where self-adaptation achieved a 7.5% improvement in IoU. The influence of the number of iterations for self-adaptation was investigated, showing that self- adaptation balances accuracy and inference time by adjusting iteration numbers and layer choices. It was found to be more efficient and accurate than model ensembles. Self-adaptation can trade off accuracy vs. runtime by using fewer update iterations or updating fewer upper network layers. Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis revealed that self-adaptation is robust to the choice of hyperpa- rameters 1, 8, and 7. The optimal values were determined using the validation set, and the model accuracy declined moderately with deviations from these values. Qualitative results showed that self-adaptation improves segmentation quality and reduces pathological failure modes. The integration of self-adaptation with state-of-the-art architectures like DeepLabv3+, HRNet-W18, HRNet-W48, and UPerNet with a Swin-T backbone demonstrated substantial improvements in segmentation accuracy across all target domains. Evaluation on the ACDC dataset, which includes adverse weather conditions, showed that self-adaptation outperformed the baseline by 13.57% on average. Additional qualitative results and failure cases were discussed, showing that self-adaptation can struggle with cases of mislabeling regions with incorrect but semantically related classes. However, these failure cases were relatively rare, and the majority of image samples benefited from self- adaptation, with accuracy improvements of up to 35% IoU compared to the baseline. 5 Results The empirical results demonstrate that self-adaptive normalization (SaN) consistently enhances segmentation accuracy in out-of-distribution scenarios. For instance, when training on the GTA dataset and testing on Cityscapes, BDD, and IDD, SaN improved the mean IoU by 4.1% with ResNet- 50 and 5.1% with ResNet-101 compared to the t-BN baseline. Furthermore, SaN outperformed the more recent p-BN method, showing improvements irrespective of the backbone architecture and the target domain tested. In terms of calibration quality, measured by the expected calibration error (ECE), SaN not only improved the baseline but also showed competitiveness with the MC-Dropout method, even exhibiting complementary effects when both methods were combined. Self-adaptation was found to outperform traditional Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) across both source domains (GTA, SYNTHIA) and three target domains (Cityscapes, BDD, IDD). Despite TTA improving the baseline, self-adaptation provided a clear and consistent margin of 2.19% IoU on 4 average. This aligns with the reported ECE scores, demonstrating that self-adaptation effectively exploits the calibrated confidence of predictions to yield reliable pseudo-labels. In comparison to state-of-the-art domain generalization methods, self-adaptation showed substantial improvements even over carefully tuned baselines. It outperformed methods like DRPC and FSDR on most benchmarks, despite these methods using individual models for each target domain and resorting to target domains for hyperparameter tuning. Self-adaptation achieved superior segmentation accuracy without requiring access to a distribution of real images for training or modifying the model architecture, unlike previous methods such as ASG, CSG, DRPC, and IBN-Net. The study also compared self-adaptation with Tent, which updates model parameters at test time by minimizing entropy. Self-adaptation, which constructs pseudo-labels based on well-calibrated predictions, substantially outperformed Tent. Specifically, when training HRNet-W18 on GTA and evaluating on Cityscapes, self-adaptation achieved a 7.5% improvement in IoU compared to Tent under a comparable computational budget. Further analysis revealed that self-adaptation provides a flexible mechanism for trading off accuracy and runtime by varying the number of update iterations and the layers to adjust. It was found to be more efficient and accurate than model ensembles. Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis indicated that self-adaptation is robust to the choice of hyperparameters, with optimal values determined using the validation set. Qualitative results demonstrated that self-adaptation visibly improves segmentation quality, reducing artifacts and mislabeling compared to the baseline. The method’s effectiveness was consistent across different architectures, including DeepLabv3+, HRNet-W18, HRNet-W48, and UPerNet with a Swin-T backbone, showing substantial improvements in segmentation accuracy on all target domains. 6 Conclusion The traditional learning principle of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) assumes independent and identically distributed training and testing data, which often results in models that are not robust to domain shifts. To address this, a self-adaptive inference process was introduced, bypassing the need for explicit assumptions about the test distribution. This study also outlined four principles for a rigorous evaluation process in domain generalization, adhering to best practices in machine learning research. The analysis demonstrated that even a single sample from the test domain can significantly improve model predictions. The self-adaptive approach showed substantial accuracy improvements without altering the training process or model architecture, unlike previous works. These results suggest that self-adaptive techniques could be valuable in other application domains, such as panoptic segmentation or monocular depth prediction. While the presented self-adaptation method is not yet real-time, it offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and computational cost compared to model ensembles. Future research could explore reducing the latency of self-adaptive inference through adaptive step sizes, higher-order optimization, or low-precision computations. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of self-adaptation to enhance model generalization and robustness in various applications. 5",1,,,,
P050.pdf,"Interpreting Recurrent and Attention-Based Neural Models: a Case Study on Natural Language Inference Abstract Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in natural language in- ference (NLI) tasks. While these models are widely explored, they are hard to interpret and it is often unclear how and why they actually work. we take a step toward explaining such deep learning based models through a case study on a popular neural model for NLI. we propose to interpret the intermediate layers of NLI models by visualizing the saliency of attention and LSTM gating signals. We present several examples for which our methods are able to reveal interesting insights and identify the critical information contributing to the model decisions. 1 Introduction Deep learning has achieved tremendous success for many NLP tasks. However, unlike traditional methods that provide optimized weights for human understandable features, the behavior of deep learning models is much harder to interpret. Due to the high dimensionality of word embeddings, and the complex, typically recurrent architectures used for textual data, it is often unclear how and why a deep learning model reaches its decisions. There are a few attempts toward explaining/interpreting deep learning-based models, mostly by visualizing the representation of words and/or hidden states, and their importances (via saliency or erasure) on shallow tasks like sentiment analysis and POS tagging. we focus on interpreting the gating and attention signals of the intermediate layers of deep models in the challenging task of Natural Language Inference. A key concept in explaining deep models is saliency, which determines what is critical for the final decision of a deep model. So far, saliency has only been used to illustrate the impact of word embeddings. we extend this concept to the intermediate layer of deep models to examine the saliency of attention as well as the LSTM gating signals to understand the behavior of these components and their impact on the final decision. We make two main contributions. First, we introduce new strategies for interpreting the behavior of deep models in their intermediate layers, specifically, by examining the saliency of the attention and the gating signals. Second, we provide an extensive analysis of the state-of-the-art model for the NLI task and show that our methods reveal interesting insights not available from traditional methods of inspecting attention and word saliency. our focus was on NLI, which is a fundamental NLP task that requires both understanding and reasoning. Furthermore, the state-of- the-art NLI models employ complex neural architectures involving key mechanisms, such as attention and repeated reading, widely seen in successful models for other NLP tasks. As such, we expect our methods to be potentially useful for other natural understanding tasks as well. 2 Task and Model In NLI, we are given two sentences, a premise and a hypothesis, the goal is to decide the logical relationship (Entailment, Neutral, or Contradiction) between them. Many of the top performing NLI models, are variants of the ESIM model, which we choose to analyze. ESIM reads the sentences independently using LSTM at first, and then applies attention to align/contrast the sentences. Another round of LSTM reading then produces the final representations, which are compared to make the prediction. 3 Visualization of Attention and Gating we are primarily interested in the internal workings of the NLI model. we focus on the attention and the gating signals of LSTM readers, and how they contribute to the decisions of the model. 3.1 Attention Attention has been widely used in many NLP tasks and is probably one of the most critical parts that affects the inference decisions. Several pieces of prior work in NLI have attempted to visualize the attention layer to provide some understanding of their models. Such visualizations generate a heatmap representing the similarity between the hidden states of the premise and the hypothesis. Unfortunately the similarities are often the same regardless of the decision. Let us consider the following example, where the same premise “A kid is playing in the garden”, is paired with three different hypotheses: h1: A kid is taking a nap in the garden h2: A kid is having fun in the garden with her family h3: A kid is having fun in the garden Note that the ground truth relationships are Contradiction, Neutral, and Entailment, respectively. The key issue is that the attention visualization only allows us to see how the model aligns the premise with the hypothesis, but does not show how such alignment impacts the decision. This prompts us to consider the saliency of attention. 3.1.1 Attention Saliency The concept of saliency was first introduced in vision for visualizing the spatial support on an image for a particular object class. In NLP, saliency has been used to study the importance of words toward a final decision. We propose to examine the saliency of attention. Specifically, given a premise-hypothesis pair and the model’s decision y, we consider the similarity between a pair of premise and hypothesis hidden states eij as a variable. The score of the decision S(y) is thus a function of eij for all i and j. The saliency of eij is then defined to be |S(y) / eij|. , the saliencies are clearly different across the examples, each highlighting different parts of the alignment. Specifically, for h1, we see the alignment between “is playing” and “taking a nap” and the alignment of “in a garden” to have the most prominent saliency toward the decision of Contradiction. For h2, the alignment of “kid” and “her family” seems to be the most salient for the decision of Neutral. Finally, for h3, the alignment between “is having fun” and “kid is playing” have the strongest impact toward the decision of Entailment. From this example, we can see that by inspecting the attention saliency, we effectively pinpoint which part of the alignments contribute most critically to the final prediction whereas simply visualizing the attention itself reveals little information. 3.1.2 Comparing Models In the previous examples, we study the behavior of the same model on different inputs. Now we use the attention saliency to compare the two different ESIM models: ESIM-50 and ESIM-300. Consider two examples with a shared hypothesis of “A man ordered a book” and premise: p1: John ordered a book from amazon p2: Mary ordered a book from amazon 2 Here ESIM-50 fails to capture the gender connections of the two different names and predicts Neutral for both inputs, whereas ESIM-300 correctly predicts Entailment for the first case and Contradiction for the second. Although the two models make different predictions, their attention maps appear qualitatively similar. We see that for both examples, ESIM-50 primarily focused on the alignment of “ordered”, whereas ESIM-300 focused more on the alignment of “John” and “Mary” with “man”. interesting to note that ESIM-300 does not appear to learn significantly different similarity values compared to ESIM-50 for the two critical pairs of words (“John”, “man”) and (“Mary”, “man”) based on the attention map. The saliency map, however, reveals that the two models use these values quite differently, with only ESIM-300 correctly focusing on them. It is 3.2 LSTM Gating Signals LSTM gating signals determine the flow of information. In other words, they indicate how LSTM reads the word sequences and how the information from different parts is captured and combined. LSTM gating signals are rarely analyzed, possibly due to their high dimensionality and complexity. we consider both the gating signals and their saliency, which is computed as the partial derivative of the score of the final decision with respect to each gating signal. Instead of considering individual dimensions of the gating signals, we aggregate them to consider their norm, both for the signal and for its saliency. Note that ESIM models have two LSTM layers, the first (input) LSTM performs the input encoding and the second (inference) LSTM generates the representation for inference. , we first note that the saliency tends to be somewhat consistent across different gates within the same LSTM, suggesting that we can interpret them jointly to identify parts of the sentence important for the model’s prediction. Comparing across examples, we see that the saliency curves show pronounced differences across the examples. For instance, the saliency pattern of the Neutral example is significantly different from the other two examples, and heavily concentrated toward the end of the sentence (“with her family”). Note that without this part of the sentence, the relationship would have been Entailment. The focus (evidenced by its strong saliency and strong gating signal) on this particular part, which presents information not available from the premise, explains the model’s decision of Neutral. Comparing the behavior of the input LSTM and the inference LSTM, we observe interesting shifts of focus. the inference LSTM tends to see much more concentrated saliency over key parts of the sentence, whereas the input LSTM sees more spread of saliency. For example, for the Contradiction example, the input LSTM sees high saliency for both “taking” and “in”, whereas the inference LSTM primarily focuses on “nap”, which is the key word suggesting a Contradiction. Note that ESIM uses attention between the input and inference LSTM layers to align/contrast the sentences, hence it makes sense that the inference LSTM is more focused on the critical differences between the sentences. This is also observed for the Neutral example as well. It is worth noting that, while revealing similar general trends, the backward LSTM can sometimes focus on different parts of the sentence, suggesting the forward and backward readings provide complementary understanding of the sentence. 4 Conclusion We propose new visualization and interpretation strategies for neural models to understand how and why they work. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies on a complex task (NLI). Our strategies are able to provide interesting insights not achievable by previous explanation techniques. Our future work will extend our study to consider other NLP tasks and models with the goal of producing useful insights for further improving these models. 3 5 Appendix 5.1 Model In this section we describe the ESIM model. We divide ESIM to three main parts: 1) input encoding, 2) attention, and 3) inference. Let u = [u1, · · · , un] and v = [v1, · · · , vm] be the given premise with length n and hypothesis with length m respectively, where ui, vj Rr are word embeddings of r-dimensional vector. The goal is to predict a label y that indicates the logical relationship between premise u and hypothesis v. Below we briefly explain the aforementioned parts. 5.1.1 Input Encoding It utilizes a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) for encoding the given premise and hypothesis using Equations 1 and 2 respectively. (1) u^ = BiLSTM(u) (2) v^ = BiLSTM(v) where u^ Rn×2d and v^ Rm×2d are the reading sequences of u and v respectively. 5.1.2 Attention It employs a soft alignment method to associate the relevant sub-components between the given premise and hypothesis. Equation 3 (energy function) computes the unnormalized attention weights as the similarity of hidden states of the premise and hypothesis. (3) eij = u^Ti v^j, i [1, n], j [1, m] where u^i and v^j are the hidden representations of u and v respectively which are computed earlier in Equations 1 and 2. Next, for each word in either premise or hypothesis, the relevant semantics in the other sentence is extracted and composed according to eij. Equations 4 and 5 provide formal and specific details of this procedure. (4) u~i = sum(exp(eij) / sum(exp(eik))) * uj, i [1, n] (5) v~j = sum(exp(eij) / sum(exp(ekj))) * ui, j [1, m] where u~i represents the extracted relevant information of v^ by attending to u^i while v~j represents the extracted relevant information of u^ by attending to v^j. Next, it passes the enriched information through a projector layer which produce the final output of attention stage. Equations 6 and 7 formally represent this process. (6) ai = [ui, u~i, ui u~i, ui u~i] ; pi = ReLU(Wpai + bi) (7) bj = [vj, v~j, vj v~j, vj v~j] ; qj = ReLU(Wqbj + byj) Here stands for element-wise product while Wp, Wq R4d×d and bp, by Rd are the trainable weights and biases of the projector layer respectively. p and q indicate the output of attention de- vision for premise and hypothesis respectively. 5.1.3 Inference During this phase, it uses another BiLSTM to aggregate the two sequences of computed matching (8) p^ = BiLSTM(p) (9) q^ = BiLSTM(q) where p^ Rn×2d and q^ Rm×2d are the reading sequences of p and q respectively. Finally the concatenation max and average pooling of p^ and q^ are pass through a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier that includes a hidden layer with tanh activation and softmax output layer. The model is trained in an end-to-end manner. 4 5.2 Attention Study Here we provide more examples on the NLI task which intend to examine specific behavior in this model. Such examples indicate interesting observation that we can analyze them in the future works. Table 1 shows the list of all example.

P051.pdf,"Real-Time Adaptation of Lexical Embeddings for Enhanced Part-of-Speech Tagging Abstract This research introduces a method for real-time unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) that can be applied incrementally as new information arrives. This method is especially useful when conventional batch DA is unfeasible. Through evaluations focused on part-of-speech (POS) tagging, we observe that real-time unsupervised DA achieves accuracy levels on par with those of batch DA. 1 Introduction Unsupervised domain adaptation is a frequently encountered challenge for developers aiming to create robust natural language processing (NLP) systems. This situation typically arises when labeled data is available for a source domain, but there is a need to enhance performance in a target domain using only unlabeled data. A majority of the current NLP research on unsupervised domain adaptation employs batch learning, which presumes the availability of a substantial corpus of unlabeled data from the target domain before the testing phase. However, batch learning is impractical in numerous real-world situations where data from a new target domain must be processed without delay. Further, in many practical scenarios, data may not be neatly categorized by domain, making it difficult to immediately discern when an input stream begins providing data from a new domain. For instance, consider an NLP system within a company that is tasked with analyzing a continuous stream of emails. This stream evolves over time without any explicit signals indicating that the current models should be adjusted to the new data distribution. Given that the system is expected to operate in real-time, it would be beneficial for any system adaptation to be done in an online manner, as opposed to the batch method, which involves halting the system, modifying it, and then restarting it. This paper introduces real-time unsupervised domain adaptation as an enhancement to conventional unsupervised DA. In this approach, domain adaptation is carried out incrementally as data is received. Specifically, our implementation involves a type of representation learning, where the focus is on updating word representations in our experiments. Every instance a word appears in the data stream during testing, its representation is refined. To our understanding, the research presented here is the first to examine real-time unsupervised DA. In particular, we assess this method for POS tagging tasks. We analyze POS tagging outcomes using three different methods: a static baseline, batch learning, and real-time unsupervised DA. Our findings indicate that real-time unsupervised DA performs comparably to batch learning, yet it does not require retraining or pre-existing data from the target domain. 2 Experimental setup Tagger. We have adapted the FLORS tagger, which is recognized for its speed and simplicity, and is particularly effective in DA scenarios. This tagger approaches POS tagging as a multi-label classification problem within a window-based framework, rather than a sequence classification one. FLORS is well-suited for real-time unsupervised DA because its word representations include distributional vectors, which can be updated during both batch learning and real-time unsupervised DA. Each word’s representation in FLORS consists of four feature vectors: one for its suffix, one for its shape, and one each for its left and right distributional neighbors. Suffix and shape features are standard in the literature, and we utilize them as described previously. Distributional features. The ith element xi of the left distributional vector for a word w is the weighted count of times the indicator word ci appears immediately to the left of w: xi = tf(freq(bigram(ci, w))) (1) where ci is the word with frequency rank i in the corpus, freq(bigram(ci, w)) is the occurrence count of the bigram ""ci w"", and non-zero frequencies are weighted logarithmically: tf(x) = 1 + log(x). The right distributional vector is defined similarly. We limit the set of indicator words to the 500 most frequent. To avoid zero vectors, an additional element xn+1 is added to each vector to account for omitted contexts: xn + 1 = tf( X .5freq(bigram(ci, w))) (2) Let f(w) be the concatenation of the two distributional, suffix, and shape vectors of word w. Then FLORS represents token vi as follows: f(viΦ22122)Φ2295f(viΦ22121)Φ2295f(vi)Φ2295f(vi + 1)Φ2295f(vi + 2) (3) where ˘2295 is vector concatenation. FLORS then tags token vi based on this representation. FLORS operates under the assumption that the fundamental relationship between distributional features and labels remains consistent when transitioning from the source to the target domain. This contrasts with other studies that select ""stable"" distributional features and discard ""unstable"" ones. The central hypothesis of FLORS is that fundamental distributional POS characteristics are relatively stable across different domains, unlike semantic or more intricate tasks. The effectiveness of FLORS suggests the validity of this hypothesis. Data. Test set. Our evaluation utilizes the development sets from six different target domains (TDs): five SANCL domains (newsgroups, weblogs, reviews, answers, emails) and sections 22-23 of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) for in-domain testing. Two training sets of varying sizes are employed. In the l:big condition (large labeled data set), FLORS is trained on sections 2-21 of the WSJ. The l:small condition uses 10% of the l:big data set. Data for word representations. We also adjust the size of the datasets used for computing word representations before training the FLORS model. In the u:big condition, distributional vectors are computed on the combined corpus of all labeled and unlabeled text from both source and target domains (excluding test sets), along with 100,000 WSJ sentences from 1988 and 500,000 sentences from a large external corpus. In the u:0 condition, only labeled training data is utilized. Methods. We implemented a modification from the original setup: distributional vectors are stored in memory as count vectors, enabling count increases during online tagging. Experiments are conducted with three versions of FLORS: STATIC, BATCH, and ONLINE. All three methods compute word representations on ""data for word representations"" before model training on one of the two ""training sets"". STATIC. Word representations remain unchanged during testing. BATCH. Before testing, count vectors are updated by freq(bigram(ci, w)) += freq*(bigram(ci, w)), where freq*(˘00b7) denotes the bigram ""ci w"" occurrences in the entire test set. ONLINE. Before tagging a test sentence, both left and right distributional vectors are updated via freq(bigram(ci, w)) += 1 for each ""ci w"" bigram appearance in the sentence. The sentence is then tagged using the updated word representations. As tagging progresses, distributional representations become increasingly specific to the target domain (TD), converging to the representations that BATCH uses at the end of the tagging process. 2 In all three modes, suffix and shape features are always fully specified, for both known and unknown words. 3 Experimental results Table 1 shows that the performance levels of BATCH and ONLINE are on par with each other and represent the current state-of-the-art. The highest accuracy in each column is highlighted in bold. Table 1: BATCH and ONLINE accuracies are comparable and state-of-the-art.

It also demonstrates that performance improves with an increase in both training data and unlabeled data. The performance of ONLINE is similar to that of BATCH. It is slightly lower than BATCH in the u:0 condition, with the most significant difference in accuracy being 0.29, and it is at most 0.02 different from BATCH in terms of overall accuracy in the u:big condition. The reasons for ONLINE occasionally outperforming BATCH, particularly in certain conditions, are discussed subsequently. 3.1 Time course of tagging accuracy The ONLINE model introduced here has a unique characteristic not commonly found in other statistical NLP research: its predictive accuracy evolves as it processes text due to the modification of its representations. To analyze the progression of these changes over time, a substantial application domain is necessary because subtle changes might be too inconsistent in the smaller test sets of the SANCL TDs. The WSJ corpus is the only labeled domain that is sufficiently large for this purpose. Consequently, we invert the usual setup by training the model on the development sets of the five SANCL domains (l:big) or on the initial 5000 labeled words of reviews (l:small). In this reversed setup, u:big utilizes the five unlabeled SANCL datasets along with a large external corpus as before. Given the importance of performance variability, we conduct 100 trials on randomly selected 50% samples of WSJ and report both the average and standard deviation of tagging errors across these trials. The results presented in Table 3 indicate that ONLINE’s error rates are only marginally higher than, or comparable to, those of BATCH. Specifically, in the l:small/u:0 condition, the error rate for known words is lower for ONLINE (0.1186) than for BATCH, similar to observations in Table 2. 3 Table 2: ONLINE / BATCH accuracies are generally better than STATIC (see bold numbers) and improve with both more training data and more unlabeled data. ! u:0 u:big ALL KN SHFT OOV ALL KN SHFT OOV l:small STATIC 87.02 90.87 71.12 57.16 89.02 91.48 81.53 58.30 ONLINE 87.99 90.87 76.10 65.64 89.84 92.38 82.58 67.09 newsgroups l:big BATCH 88.28 91.08 77.01 66.37 89.82 92.37 82.65 67.03 STATIC 89.69 93.00 82.65 57.82 89.93 92.41 84.94 58.97 ONLINE 90.51 93.13 82.51 67.57 90.85 93.04 84.94 71.00 BATCH 90.69 93.12 83.24 69.43 90.87 93.03 85.20 71.18 l:small STATIC 89.08 91.96 66.55 65.90 91.45 92.47 80.11 70.81 ONLINE 89.67 92.14 70.14 69.67 92.11 93.62 81.46 78.42 reviews l:big BATCH 89.79 92.23 69.86 71.27 92.10 93.60 81.51 78.42 STATIC 91.96 93.94 82.30 67.97 92.42 93.53 84.65 69.97 ONLINE 92.33 94.03 83.59 72.50 93.07 94.36 85.71 79.03 BATCH 92.42 94.09 83.53 73.35 93.07 94.36 85.71 79.03 l:small STATIC 91.58 94.29 79.95 72.74 93.42 94.77 89.80 77.42 ONLINE 92.51 94.52 81.76 80.46 94.21 95.40 91.08 84.03 weblogs l:big BATCH 92.68 94.60 82.34 81.20 94.20 95.42 91.03 83.87 STATIC 93.45 95.64 90.15 72.68 94.09 95.54 91.90 76.94 ONLINE 94.18 95.82 89.80 80.35 94.86 95.81 92.60 86.53 BATCH 94.34 95.85 90.03 81.84 94.86 95.82 92.60 86.53 l:small STATIC 86.93 90.89 66.51 53.43 88.98 91.09 77.63 57.36 ONLINE 87.48 91.18 68.07 56.47 89.71 92.42 78.11 64.21 answers l:big BATCH 87.56 91.11 68.25 58.44 89.71 92.43 78.23 64.09 STATIC 89.54 92.76 78.65 56.22 90.06 92.18 80.70 58.25 ONLINE 89.98 92.97 79.07 59.77 90.68 93.21 81.48 65.16 BATCH 90.14 93.10 79.01 60.72 90.70 93.22 81.54 65.29 l:small STATIC 85.43 90.85 57.85 51.65 87.76 90.35 70.86 56.76 ONLINE 86.30 91.26 60.56 55.83 88.45 92.31 71.67 61.57 emails l:big BATCH 86.42 91.31 61.03 56.32 88.46 92.32 71.71 61.65 STATIC 88.31 92.98 71.38 52.71 89.21 91.74 73.80 58.99 ONLINE 88.86 93.08 72.38 57.78 89.85 93.30 75.32 65.48 BATCH 88.96 93.11 72.28 58.85 89.84 93.30 75.27 65.44 l:small STATIC 94.64 95.44 83.38 82.72 95.73 95.88 90.36 87.87 ONLINE 94.86 95.53 85.37 85.22 95.80 96.21 89.89 89.70 wsj l:big BATCH 94.80 95.46 85.51 85.38 95.80 96.22 89.89 89.70 STATIC 96.44 96.85 92.75 85.38 96.56 96.72 93.35 88.04 ONLINE 96.50 96.85 93.55 86.38 96.62 96.89 93.35 91.69 BATCH 96.57 96.82 93.48 86.54 96.63 96.89 93.42 91.86 Table 3 also includes data on ""unseens"" along with unknowns, as prior research indicates that unseens lead to at least as many errors as unknowns. Unseens are defined as words with tags not present in the training data, and error rates for unseens are calculated across all their occurrences, including those with both seen and unseen tags. As shown in Table 3, the error rate for unknowns is higher than that for unseens, which in turn is higher than the error rate for known words. When examining individual conditions, ONLINE generally outperforms STATIC, showing better results in 10 out of 12 cases and only slightly underperforming in the l:small/u:big condition for unseens and known words (0.1086 vs. 0.1084, 0.0802 vs. 0.0801). In four conditions, ONLINE is significantly better, with improvements ranging from 0.005 to over 0.06. The differences between ONLINE and STATIC in the remaining eight conditions are minimal. For the six u:big conditions, this is expected as the large unlabeled dataset is from the news domain, similar to WSJ. Therefore, if large unlabeled datasets similar to the target domain are available, using STATIC tagging may suffice since the additional effort for ONLINE/BATCH may not be justified. 4 Table 3: Error rates (err) and standard deviations (std) for tagging. ˘2020 (resp. ˘2217): significantly different from ONLINE error rate above&below (resp. from “u:0” error rate to the left). unknowns unseens u:0 u:big u:0 u:big u err std err std err std err std err l:small STATIC .3670˘2020 .00085 .3094 .00160 .1659˘2020 .00076 .1467 .00120 .1309˘202 ONLINE .3050˘2020 .00143 .2104 .00081 .1646˘2020 .00145 .1084 .00056 .1251˘202 BATCH .3094 .00160 .2102˘2217 .00093 .1404 .00125 .1037˘2217 .00098 .1186 l:big STATIC .1451˘2020 .00114 .1042 .00100 .0732 .00052 .0690 .00042 .0534 ONLINE .1404 .00125 .1037˘2217 .00098 .0727 .00051 .0689˘2217 .00051 .0529 BATCH .1382˘2020 .00140 .1033 .00112 .0723 .00065 .0680 .00062 .0528 Increasing the amount of labeled data consistently reduces error rates, as does increasing unlabeled data. The differences are significant for ONLINE tagging in all six cases, marked by ˘2217 in the table. There is no significant difference in variability between ONLINE and BATCH, suggesting that ONLINE is preferable due to its equal variability and higher performance, without requiring a dataset available before tagging begins. The progression of tagging accuracy over time is illustrated in Figure 1. BATCH and STATIC maintain constant error rates as they do not adjust representations during tagging. ONLINE’s error rate for unknown words decreases, approaching BATCH’s error rate, as more is learned with each occurrence of an unknown word. 4 Related Work Online learning typically refers to supervised learning algorithms that update the model after process- ing a few training examples. Many supervised learning algorithms are online or have online versions. Active learning is another supervised learning framework that processes training examples ˘2014 usually obtained interactively ˘2014 in small batches. All of this work on supervised online learning is not directly relevant to this paper since we address the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation. Unlike online supervised learners, we keep the statistical model unchanged during domain adaptation and adopt a representation learning approach: each unlabeled context of a word is used to update its representation. There is much work on unsupervised domain adaptation for part-of-speech tagging, including work using constraint-based methods, instance weighting, self-training, and co-training. All of this work uses batch learning. For space reasons, we do not discuss supervised domain adaptation. 5 Conclusion This study introduces a method for real-time updating of word representations, a new form of domain adaptation designed for scenarios where target domain data are processed in a stream, making BATCH processing unfeasible. We demonstrate that real-time unsupervised domain adaptation achieves performance levels comparable to batch learning. Moreover, it significantly reduces error rates compared to STATIC methods, which do not employ domain adaptation. Acknowledgments.

P052.pdf,"Specialized Neural Network for Extracting Financial Trading Signals: The Alpha Discovery Neural Network Abstract Genetic programming (GP) is currently the leading method for automated feature generation in financial applica- tions. It utilizes reverse Polish notation to denote features and subsequently performs an evolutionary procedure. Nevertheless, with the advancements in deep learning, more effective feature extraction instruments have become accessible. This research introduces the Alpha Discovery Neural Network (ADNN), a customized neural network architecture designed to autonomously generate a variety of financial technical indicators using established knowledge. Our primary contributions are threefold. Firstly, we employ domain-specific expertise in quantitative trading to formulate sampling guidelines and the objective function. Secondly, we substitute genetic programming with pre-training and model pruning techniques to enable a more streamlined evolutionary process. Thirdly, the feature extraction components within ADNN can be interchanged with various other feature extractors, resulting in the creation of diverse functions. Empirical findings demonstrate that ADNN can produce more distinct and informative features in comparison to GP, thereby effectively augmenting the existing pool of factors. Fully connected and recurrent networks demonstrate superior performance in extracting information from financial time series compared to convolutional neural networks. In practical scenarios, the features generated by ADNN consistently enhance the revenue, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown of multi-factor strategies when contrasted with investment strategies that do not incorporate these factors. 1 Introduction Predicting the future returns of stocks is a paramount and demanding endeavor in the field of quantitative trading. Numerous factors, including historical price, volume, and a company’s financial information, can be employed to forecast the future returns of stocks. Typically, researchers categorize features derived from price and volume as technical indicators, while those derived from a company’s financial data are classified as fundamental data. Various well-known multi-factor models have been introduced to address this task, and numerous established technical and fundamental factors have been developed. For instance, the Fama-French Three-Factor Model utilizes three crucial factors that furnish the majority of the information required to elucidate stock returns. Subsequently, the Fama-French Five-Factor Model and numerous other factors have been formulated by domain experts. Nonetheless, two limitations exist. Firstly, recruiting human specialists is quite costly. Secondly, humans are unable to create certain nonlinear features from data with high dimensionality. Consequently, both academic scholars and institutional investors have increasingly focused on the task of automated financial feature engineering. Feature engineering is a procedure that uncovers the connections between features and expands the feature space by deducing or generating novel features. During this operation, new features can be created by combining pre-existing features. A more explicit explanation is that algorithms employ operators, hyper-parameters, and existing features to construct a new feature. Occasionally, feature construction and feature selection can be integrated into a single process. These methodologies encompass wrapper, filtering, and embedded techniques. Filtering is straightforward but yields suboptimal results; it merely employs certain criteria to select a feature and can sometimes aid in overseeing the feature construction process. The wrapper method exhibits strong performance by directly utilizing the model’s outcomes as an objective function. Consequently, it can treat an independently trained model as a newly generated feature. Nevertheless, a substantial quantity of computational resources and time are necessary. Embedded is an approach that employs generalized factors and a pruning method to choose or amalgamate features, serving as an intermediate option between filtering and wrapper techniques. 2 Related Work With the progression of deep learning, an increasing number of researchers are utilizing neural networks to derive features from raw data and subsequently incorporating a fully connected layer to modify the feature’s output. Similarly, a trained model signifies a newly developed feature. Researchers have leveraged it on pattern recognition tasks, employing a CNN model to construct facial descriptors, and this method generates features that possess considerably more information than the previous method. Experiments have been conducted on this task, employing a deeper and wider convolutional neural network. Recurrent neural networks have been used to pre-locate feature-rich regions and successfully construct more refined features. In a text classification task, recurrent neural networks have been utilized to build a rule-based classifier among text data, wherein each classifier represents a portion of the text. A network structure that uses both a recurrent neural network and a convolutional neural network to extract text information has been proposed. Utilizing a neural network’s robust fitting capability, we can generate highly informative features by customizing the network architecture for diverse industries. In financial feature engineering tasks, researchers have commenced employing neural networks to provide an embedding representation of financial time series. More specifically, LSTM has been utilized to embed various stock time series, followed by adversarial training to perform binary classification on a stock’s future return. Well-designed LSTM has been adopted to extract features from unstructured news data, subsequently forming a continuous embedding. The experimental outcomes indicate that these unstructured data can furnish substantial information and are highly beneficial for event-driven trading. A Skip-gram architecture has been employed to learn stock embedding, inspired by a valuable knowledge repository formed by fund managers’ collective investment behaviors. This embedding can more effectively represent the varying affinities across technical indicators. Adopting a similar concept, we employ a neural network to provide a concise embedding of extended financial time series. 3 Methodology The ADNN’s network architecture is structured in a specific way. The primary contributions of this innovative network structure are: 1) ADNN employs Spearman Correlation as its loss function, mirroring the practices of human quantitative investment. Furthermore, the sampling guidelines adhere to economic principles. 2) A significant, derivable kennel function is introduced as a substitute for the non-derivable operator. 3) We utilize pre-training and pruning in place of the GP’s evolutionary process, resulting in enhanced efficiency. In each back-propagation cycle, ADNN randomly selects data from a certain number of trading days and subsequently computes the Spearman Coefficient between the factor value and factor return for each of those days. The number of days should be greater than 3, and incorporating information from multiple trading days enables the neural network to achieve a more consistent convergence. Quantitative investors prioritize the relative strength of each stock on a given trading day over its absolute strength. Therefore, performing calculations for each trading day and employing the Spearman Coefficient as the loss function is justifiable. We posit that there are a certain number of stocks pertaining to a given trading day in each batch. The input tensor has a specific shape because there are a certain number of samples, and five categories of time series: the opening price, high price, low price, closing price, and volume. Each time series has an input length. We also designate the output tensor as the factor value, possessing a particular shape. The factor return tensor has a specific shape, denoting the profit we can obtain from this asset over an extended duration. The holding period’s length is defined. Here, we presume that all feature extractors are Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs), simplifying the provision of a general mathematical description. In the experimental section, we will present the experimental outcomes based on more intricate and varied feature extractors. 4 Experiments We utilize daily trading data from the Chinese A-share stock market, encompassing the daily opening, high, low, closing prices, and trading volume over the preceding 30 trading days. The raw data is standardized using its time-series mean and standard deviation derived from the training set. Both the mean and standard deviation are computed from the training set. We endeavor to employ these inputs to forecast the stock return for the subsequent 5 trading days (utilizing 3-15 trading days is advisable). Furthermore, we must adhere to market regulations when devising a trading strategy. Extensive experiments have been performed to identify appropriate hyper-parameters. For each experiment, 250 trading days constitute the training set, the ensuing 30 trading days serve as the validation set, and the subsequent 90 trading days function as the testing set. The generated factors maintain a high Information Coefficient (IC) throughout the subsequent 90 trading days. Most significantly, we emphasize a counter-intuitive configuration: the training period should not surpass 250 trading days due to the non-stationary nature of financial features. If we mandate a feature to function effectively over an extended duration, we will only encounter this feature in an over-fitting scenario. Consequently, we devise a rolling forecast framework wherein we automatically identify potent features for each trading day. Each autonomously generated feature will have its own period of prominence on that particular trading day. Moreover, these factors not only perform effectively on this single day but also maintain their efficacy for several trading days, exhibiting a gradual decline. To ensure an equitable comparison, the identical configuration is implemented for the GP algorithm. The logic of this algorithm references related work. Moreover, the input data’s period and type must be consistent. In this paper, we scrutinize the performance of the constructed features from diverse angles. Typically, institutional investors employ the Information Coefficient (IC), to quantify the amount of information conveyed by a feature. For diversity, cross-entropy is utilized to gauge the distance between the distributions of two distinct features on the same trading day. 2 5 Results The network structure can equip ADNN with different deep neural networks. In order to show the general situation, we equip ADNN with 4 fully-connected layers. Each layer has 128 neural, tanh activate function, L2 Regularization, and dropout technic. This general and simple setting is enough to beat the GP. We put forward three schemes help to show how ADNN beat the GP. Only GP means only using genetic programming, Only ADNN means only use ADNN to construct factors, GP&ADNN means use GP’s value to initialize ADNN and then construct factors. All the experiments are conducted out of the sample. Table 1 shows that Only ADNN is better than Only GP, which means ADNN outperforms GP on this task. And we also find that GP&ADNN is the best, it means that our method can even improve the performance of GP. Table 1: The performance of different schemes. Object Information Coefficient Diversity Only GP 0.094 17.21 GP&ADNN 0.122 25.44 Only ADNN 0.107 21.65 In real practice, we should leverage the constructed factors to form a multi-factor strategy and compare its performance with GP. The specific strategy setting is same as section 3.4, and we have repeated this experiment on different periods of time. The long-term backtest result is shown in Table 2, Only ADNN always has better performance than the Only GP. It shows that ADNN has also beaten the SOTA in real practice. Similar to the conculsions made above, if we combine these two methods together, the combined factors’ strategy has the best performance in backtesting. Table 2: Strategy’s absolute return for each scheme. Time Only GP GP&ADNN Only ADNN ZZ500 Train:2015.01-2015.12 Test: 2016.02-2016.03 +2.59% +5.74% +4.52% +1.67% Train:2016.01-2016.12 Test: 2017.02-2017.03 +5.40% +10.26% +8.33% +2.53% Train:2017.01-2017.12 Test: 2018.02-2018.03 -5.27% -4.95% -4.16% -6.98% Train:2018.01-2018.12 Test: 2019.02-2019.03 +13.00% +15.62% +15.41% +13.75% All the results shown above is based on the most basic feature extractors. So will there be more powerful feature extractors to discover knowledge from financial time series? And what is the suitable input data structure for financial time series? Table 3 shows that, basically, all neural networks can produce more diversified features than using GP. But temporal extractors are especially better at producing diversified features, such as LSTM and Transformer. As for TCN, the author who put forward this network structure proves its ability to capture the temporal rules buried in data. However, there is a huge difference. TCN relies on a convolution neural network, but LSTM and Transformer still contain recurrent neural networks (Normally, the transformer uses a recurrent neural network to embedded the input data). The existence of a recurrent neural network structure may contribute to the difference in diversity. For Le-net and Resnet, they don’t provide us with more informative features. It looks like that the convolution network structure is not suitable to extract information from the financial time series. Table 3: The higher are the information coefficient (IC) and diversity, the better is their performance. Normally, a good feature’s long-term IC should be higher than 0.05, but it cannot be higher than 0.2 in an A-share market. Type Network IC Diversity Time Baseline GP 0.072 17.532 0.215 hours Vanilla FCN 0.124 22.151 0.785 hours Le-net 0.123 20.194 1.365 hours Spatial Resnet-50 0.108 21.403 3.450 hours LSTM 0.170 24.469 1.300 hours Temporal TCN 0.105 21.139 2.725 hours Transformer 0.111 25.257 4.151 hours In practical applications, we integrate conventional factors with those generated by ADNN to formulate a quantitative investment strategy. Our objective is to ascertain whether ADNN can enhance the factor pool and improve upon the traditional multi-factor strategy. We establish a commonly employed multi-factor strategy to assess its performance in a real-world context. Within the training set, samples whose returns rank in the top 30% for each trading day are designated as 1, while those ranking in the bottom 30% are labeled as 0. The remaining samples in the training set are discarded. Following the training of these features using XGBoost in 3 binary logistics mode, the prediction outcome reflects the probability of a stock exhibiting exceptional performance in the subsequent 5 trading days. It designates the 50 features constructed by human experts as PK 50, the features constructed by ADNN as New 50, and the features constructed by both GP and PK as GP-PK 50. In separate experiments, we use XGBoost to pre-train both PK 50 and New 50 in the training set and then using the weight score from XGBoost to choose the 50 most important features as Combined 50. This feature selection process only happens once, and only be conducted in training set. Table 4 shows the results of the backtesting. Table 4: Back testing starts from Jan 2019 to June 2019. The investment target is all A-share, except for the stock can’t be traded during this period of time. Strategy’s commission fee is 0.5%. SR refers to Sharpe Ratio, MD represents Max- Drawdown. ! Type Target Group Revenue MD SR ZZ500 Stock Index 19.60% 13,50% 1.982 Baseline HS300 Stock Index 18.60% 20.30% 1.606 PK PK 50 24.70% 18.90% 2.314 GP 50 17.60% 25.30% 1.435 GP GP-PK 50 25.40% 14.80% 2.672 New 50 20.60% 15.80% 2.189 Vanilla FCN Combined 50 29.60% 15.70% 3.167 New 50 18.00% 16.90% 1.800 Le-net Combined 50 27.50% 16.40% 2.921 Spatial New 50 19.90% 15.40% 1.962 Resnet-50 Combined 50 29.30% 17.20% 2.787 New 50 19.50% 13.00% 2.205 LSTM Combined 50 29.90% 15.00% 3.289 Temporal New 50 22.40% 14.70% 2.440 TCN Combined 50 26.90% 16.80% 2.729 New 50 21.10% 15.90% 2.203 Transformer Combined 50 27.20% 15.10% 2.806 As shown in Table 4, HS300 and ZZ500 are important stock indices in the A-share stock market. Revenue represents the annualized excess return, by longing portfolio and shorting the index. The max drawdown is the worst loss of the excess return from its peak. The Sharpe ratio is the annually adjusted excess return divided by a certain level of risk. These indicators can show the strategy’s performance from the perspective of both return and risk. For the New 50, although they have higher IC than the PK 50, their overall performance is not always better than PK 50. Because the overall performance of a multi-factor strategy is determined by both diversity and information volume (IC), we guess the diversity of PK 50 is remarkably higher than the diversity of New 50. We also did experiment to verify this guess. Thus, although every single new factor is better than the old factor, their overall performance not always be better. ADNN’s diversity is larger than the GP, but for further research, making ADNN’s diversity even larger is still badly needed. In the real world use case, all investors have their own reliable and secret factor pool, what they want is that the new constructed factors can bring in margin benefits. Thus, they will use both new and old factors to do trading. That’s the reason why Combined 50 can represent ADNN’s contribution in the real situation. In all cases, Combined 50 is better than PK 50 and GP-PK 50, which means that the ADNN not only perform better than GP, but also can enrich investors’ factor pool. 4 6 Conclusion In this research, we introduce the Alpha Discovery Neural Network (ADNN), a system capable of autonomously generating financial features from raw data. We have meticulously crafted its network architecture in accordance with economic principles and furnished it with a variety of sophisticated feature extractors. Empirical results indicate that ADNN can generate features that are more informative and diverse than those produced by the benchmark method in this specific application. In practical scenarios, ADNN also demonstrates superior revenue, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown compared to genetic programming. Furthermore, different feature extractors assume distinct roles. We have conducted numerous experiments to validate this observation and endeavor to comprehend its functionality. For future research, we intend to employ this framework to automatically generate valuable features based on companies’ fundamental data and sentiment data. 5",0,,,,

The role of microprocessors in modern society cannot be overstated, as they have become an integral part of our daily lives, much like the humble toaster, which has been elevated to an art form in some cultures, where the nuances of toasting are revered and studied with great fervor, and the toaster is no longer just a simple device, but a transcendent entity that embodies the very essence of toastiness, a concept that has been extensively studied in the context of microprocessor design, particularly in relation to the flibuluxity of the system, which is a critical parameter that determines the overall flumplen of the device, and has been shown to be directly related to the wizzle whim of the user, who must be able to navigate the complexities of the microprocessor with ease and finesse, much like a master chef navigating the intricacies of a soufflé, which is a delicate balance of ingredients and temperatures that must be carefully calibrated in order to achieve the perfect flumplen, a term that has been coined to describe the optimal balance of flibber and flazzle in a microprocessor, and has been extensively studied in the context of microprocessor design, particularly in relation to the snizzle of the system, which is a critical parameter that determines the overall wuggle of the device.

P054.pdf,"3D Food Modeling from Images: Advancements in Physically-Aware Reconstruction Abstract The growing focus on computer vision for applications in nutritional monitoring and dietary tracking has spurred the creation of sophisticated 3D reconstruction methods for various food items. A lack of high-quality data, combined with insufficient collaboration between academic research and industry applications, has hindered advancements in this area. This paper outlines a comprehensive workshop and challenge centered on physically informed 3D food reconstruction, leveraging recent progress in 3D reconstruction technologies. The central objective of this challenge is to create volume-accurate 3D models of food using 2D images, with a visible checkerboard serving as a critical size reference. Participants were assigned the task of building 3D models for 20 distinct food items, each presenting varying degrees of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard. The easy category offers 200 images, the medium provides 30, and the hard level includes only a single image to facilitate the reconstruction process. During the final evaluation stage, 16 teams presented their results. The methodologies developed during this challenge have yielded encouraging outcomes in 3D food reconstruction, demonstrating considerable potential for enhancing portion estimation in dietary evaluations and nutritional tracking. 1 Introduction The merging of computer vision with the culinary domain has unveiled new possibilities in dietary oversight and nutritional evaluation. The 3D Food Modeling Workshop Challenge signifies a notable advancement in this domain, responding to the escalating demand for precise and adaptable techniques for estimating food portions and monitoring nutritional consumption. These technological solutions are essential for encouraging beneficial eating patterns and addressing health issues related to diet. This initiative aims to close the divide between current methodologies and practical needs by concentrating on the development of accurate 3D models of food items from multi-view and single- view image data. The challenge promotes the creation of novel methods capable of managing the intricacies of food forms, textures, and variations in lighting, all while adhering to the practical limitations inherent in real-world dietary assessment situations. Conventional methods for diet assessment, like 24-Hour Recall or Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQ), frequently depend on manual data entry, which can be imprecise and difficult to manage. Additionally, the lack of 3D data in 2D RGB food images poses significant hurdles for methods that rely on regression to estimate food portions directly from images of eating occasions. By making progress in 3D reconstruction techniques for food, the aim is to provide tools for nutritional assessment that are more accurate and easier to use. This technology holds the potential to enhance the way food experiences are shared and could significantly influence areas such as nutritional science and public health initiatives. Participants were tasked with creating 3D models of 20 different food items from 2D images, simulating a scenario where a smartphone equipped with a depth-sensing camera is employed for dietary recording and nutritional oversight. The challenge was divided into three levels of complexity: . The easy level provided approximately 200 frames uniformly sampled from a video, the medium level offered about 30 images, and the hard level presented participants with just one monocular top-view image. This arrangement was intended to assess the resilience and adaptability of the suggested solutions under various real-world conditions. One of the main aspects of the challenge involves the use of a visible checkerboard as a tangible benchmark, coupled with the inclusion of depth images for each frame of the video, thereby ensuring the generated 3D models retain precise real-world measurements for estimating portion sizes. 2 Related Work Estimating food portions is a crucial part of image-based dietary assessment, with the objective of determining the volume, energy content, or macronutrient breakdown directly from images of meals. Unlike the extensively researched area of food recognition, determining food portions presents a distinct difficulty because of the lack of 3D data and physical benchmarks, which are necessary for precisely deducing the actual sizes of food portions. Specifically, accurately estimating portion sizes requires an understanding of the volume and density of the food, aspects that cannot be easily determined from a two-dimensional image, which highlights the need for advanced methodologies and technologies to address this issue. Current methods for estimating food portions are classified into four primary categories. Stereo-Based Approaches. These techniques depend on multiple frames to deduce the 3D con- figuration of food items. For instance, some methods calculate food volume through multi-view stereo reconstruction based on epipolar geometry, while others use a two-view dense reconstruction approach. Another technique, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), is employed for continuous, real-time estimation of food volume. However, the need for multiple images limits the practicality of these methods in real-world situations. Model-Based Approach. This approach uses predefined shapes and templates to estimate the target volume. Some methods assign specific templates to foods from a reference set and make adjustments based on physical cues to gauge the size and position of the food. A similar approach that matches templates is employed to estimate food volume from just one image. However, these methods struggle to accommodate foods with shapes that do not conform to the established templates. Depth Camera-Based Approach. This method utilizes depth cameras to create maps that indicate the distance from the camera to the food in the picture. The depth map is then used to create a voxel representation of the image, which aids in estimating the food’s volume. The primary drawbacks are the need for high-quality depth maps and the additional processing steps required for depth sensors used by consumers. Deep Learning Approach. Techniques based on neural networks use the vast amount of image data available to train sophisticated networks for estimating food portions. Some use regression networks to estimate the caloric value of food from a single image or from an ""Energy Distribution Map"" that correlates the input image with the energy distribution of the foods shown. Others use regression networks trained on images and depth maps to deduce the energy, mass, and macronutrients of the food in the image. These methods require extensive data for training and are generally not transparent. Their performance can significantly decline if the input test image deviates substantially from the training data. Despite the progress these methods have made in estimating food portions, they each have limitations that restrict their broad use and precision in practical scenarios. Methods based on stereo are not suitable for single-image inputs, those based on models have difficulty with a variety of food shapes, approaches using depth cameras necessitate specialized equipment, and deep learning methods are not easily interpretable and have difficulty with samples that are different from those they were trained on. To tackle these issues, 3D reconstruction provides a viable solution by offering thorough spatial data, accommodating different food shapes, possibly functioning with just one image, presenting results that are visually understandable, and facilitating a uniform method for estimating food portions. These benefits were the driving force behind the organization of the 3D Food Reconstruction challenge, which seeks to surmount the current limitations and create techniques for food portion estimation that are more accurate, user-friendly, and broadly applicable, thereby making a significant impact on nutritional assessment and dietary monitoring. 2 3 Datasets and Evaluation Pipeline 3.1 Dataset Description The dataset for the 3D Food Modeling Challenge includes 20 carefully chosen food items, each having been scanned with a 3D scanner and also captured on video. To ensure the reconstructed 3D models accurately represent size, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern mat, which provide a physical reference for scaling. The challenge is segmented into three levels of difficulty, based on the number of 2D images provided for reconstruction: • Easy: Roughly 200 images taken from video. • Medium: 30 images. • Hard: A single top-down image. Table 1: 3D Food Modeling Challenge Data Details Object Index Food Item Difficulty Level Number of Frames 1 Strawberry Easy 199 2 Cinnamon bun Easy 200 3 Pork rib Easy 200 4 Corn Easy 200 5 French toast Easy 200 6 Sandwich Easy 200 7 Burger Easy 200 8 Cake Easy 200 9 Blueberry muffin Medium 30 10 Banana Medium 30 11 Salmon Medium 30 12 Steak Medium 30 13 Burrito Medium 30 14 Hotdog Medium 30 15 Chicken nugget Medium 30 16 Everything bagel Hard 1 17 Croissant Hard 1 18 Shrimp Hard 1 19 Waffle Hard 1 20 Pizza Hard 1 3.2 Evaluation Pipeline The evaluation is divided into two stages, focusing on the accuracy of the reconstructed 3D models in terms of their form (3D structure) and portion size (volume). 3.2.1 Phase-I: Volume Accuracy In the first phase, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is used as the metric to evaluate the accuracy of portion size. The calculation for MAPE is as follows: MAPE = 1 n n X i=1  Ai −Fi Ai  × 100% where Ai represents the actual volume (in milliliters) of the i-th food item, as determined from the scanned 3D mesh, and Fi is the volume calculated from the reconstructed 3D mesh. 3 3.2.2 Phase-II: Shape Accuracy Teams that perform well in Phase-I are asked to provide full 3D mesh files for each food item. This phase includes multiple steps to guarantee both accuracy and fairness: 1. Model Verification: Submitted models are checked against the final submissions from Phase-I to ensure they are consistent. Visual inspections are also conducted to prevent any violations of the rules, such as submitting basic shapes (like spheres) rather than detailed reconstructions. 2. Model Alignment: Participants are given the true 3D models and the script used for calculating the final Chamfer distance. They must align their models with these true models and create a transformation matrix for each item submitted. The ultimate Chamfer distance score is then calculated using the submitted models and their corresponding transformation matrices. 3. Chamfer Distance Calculation: The accuracy of the shape is assessed using the Chamfer distance. For two sets of points, X and Y , the Chamfer distance is computed as follows: dCD(X, Y ) = 1 |X| X x∈X min y∈Y ∥x −y∥2 2 + 1 |Y | X y∈Y min x∈X ∥x −y∥2 2 This metric offers a thorough assessment of how closely the reconstructed 3D models match the actual models. The ultimate ranking is determined by merging the scores from both Phase-I (accuracy of volume) and Phase-II (accuracy of shape). It should be noted that after evaluating Phase-I, some issues with the data quality for object 12 (steak) and object 15 (chicken nugget) were found. To maintain the competition’s quality and fairness, these two items have been removed from the final overall evaluation. 4 First Place Team - VolETA 4.1 Methodology The team’s research employs multi-view reconstruction to generate detailed food meshes and accu- rately determine food volumes. 4.1.1 Overview The team’s method integrates computer vision and deep learning to accurately estimate food volume from RGBD images and masks. Keyframe selection, supported by perceptual hashing and blur detection, ensures data quality. The estimation of camera poses and object segmentation establishes the basis for neural surface reconstruction, resulting in detailed meshes for volume estimation. Refinement processes, such as removing isolated parts and adjusting the scaling factor, improve accuracy. 4.1.2 The Team’s Proposal: VolETA The team starts their process by obtaining input data, specifically RGBD images and their correspond- ing food object masks. These RGBD images are denoted as ID = {ID i }n i=1, where n is the total number of frames, providing the necessary depth information alongside the RGB images. The food object masks, denoted as {M F i }n i=1, help identify the regions of interest within these images. Next, the team proceeds with keyframe selection. From the set {ID i }n i=1, keyframes {IK j }k j=1 ⊆ {ID i }n i=1 are selected. The team implements a method to detect and remove duplicates and blurry images to ensure high-quality frames. This involves applying the Gaussian blurring kernel followed by the fast Fourier transform method. Near-Image Similarity employs a perceptual hashing and hamming distance thresholding to detect similar images and keep overlapping. The duplicates and blurry images are excluded from the selection process to maintain data integrity and accuracy. Using the selected keyframes {IK j }k j=1, the team estimates the camera poses through a Structure from Motion approach (i.e., extracting features using a feature detection method, matching them 4 using a matching algorithm, and refining them). The outputs are the set of camera poses {Cj}k j=1, which are crucial for spatial understanding of the scene. In parallel, the team utilizes a segmentation algorithm for reference object segmentation. This algorithm segments the reference object with a user-provided segmentation prompt (i.e., user click), producing a reference object mask M R for each keyframe. This mask is a foundation for tracking the reference object across all frames. The team then applies a memory tracking method, which extends the reference object mask M R to all frames, resulting in a comprehensive set of reference object masks {M R i }n i=1. This ensures consistency in reference object identification throughout the dataset. To create RGBA images, the team combines the RGB images, reference object masks {M R i }n i=1, and food object masks {M F i }n i=1. This step, denoted as {IR i }n i=1, integrates the various data sources into a unified format suitable for further processing. The team converts the RGBA images {IR i }n i=1 and camera poses {Cj}k j=1 into meaningful metadata and modeled data Dm. This transformation facilitates the accurate reconstruction of the scene. The modeled data Dm is then input into a neural surface reconstruction algorithm for mesh recon- struction. This algorithm generates colorful meshes {Rf, Rr} for the reference and food objects, providing detailed 3D representations of the scene components. The team applies the ""Remove Isolated Pieces"" technique to refine the reconstructed meshes. Given that the scenes contain only one food item, the team sets the diameter threshold to 5% of the mesh size. This method deletes isolated connected components whose diameter is less than or equal to this 5% threshold, resulting in a cleaned mesh {RCf, RCr}. This step ensures that only significant and relevant parts of the mesh are retained. The team manually identifies an initial scaling factor S using the reference mesh via a mesh processing tool for scaling factor identification. This factor is then fine-tuned Sf using depth information and food and reference masks, ensuring accurate scaling relative to real-world dimensions. Finally, the fine-tuned scaling factor Sf is applied to the cleaned food mesh RCf, producing the final scaled food mesh RFf. This step culminates in an accurately scaled 3D representation of the food object, enabling precise volume estimation. 4.1.3 Detecting the scaling factor Generally, 3D reconstruction methods generate unitless meshes (i.e., no physical scale) by default. To overcome this limitation, the team manually identifies the scaling factor by measuring the distance for each block for the reference object mesh. Next, the team takes the average of all blocks lengths lavg, while the actual real-world length is constant lreal = 0.012 in meter. Furthermore, the team applies the scaling factor S = lreal/lavg on the clean food mesh RCf, producing the final scaled food mesh RFf in meter. The team leverages depth information alongside food and reference object masks to validate the scaling factors. The team’s method for assessing food size entails utilizing overhead RGB images for each scene. Initially, the team determines the pixel-per-unit (PPU) ratio (in meters) using the reference object. Subsequently, the team extracts the food width (fw) and length (fl) employing a food object mask. To ascertain the food height (fh), the team follows a two-step process. Firstly, the team conducts binary image segmentation using the overhead depth and reference images, yielding a segmented depth image for the reference object. The team then calculates the average depth utilizing the segmented reference object depth (dr). Similarly, employing binary image segmentation with an overhead food object mask and depth image, the team computes the average depth for the segmented food depth image (df). Finally, the estimated food height fh is computed as the absolute difference between dr and df. Furthermore, to assess the accuracy of the scaling factor S, the team computes the food bounding box volume ((fw × fl × fh) × PPU). The team evaluates if the scaling factor S generates a food volume close to this potential volume, resulting in Sfine. For one-shot 3D reconstruction, the team leverages a single view reconstruction method for recon- structing a 3D from a single RGBA view input after applying binary image segmentation on both food RGB and mask. Next, the team removes isolated pieces from the generated mesh. After that, the team reuses the scaling factor S, which is closer to the potential volume of the clean mesh. 5 4.2 Experimental Results 4.2.1 Implementation settings The experiments were conducted using two GPUs: a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with 12GB of memory and an RTX 3060 with 6GB of memory. For near-image similarity detection, the Hamming distance was set to 12. To identify blurry images, even numbers within the range of [0...30] were used as the Gaussian kernel radius. In the process of removing isolated pieces, a diameter threshold of 5% was applied. Neural surface reconstruction involved 15,000 iterations, with a mesh resolution of 512x512. The unit cube parameters were set with an ""aabb scale"" of 1, ""scale"" at 0.15, and ""offset"" at [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] for each food scene. 4.2.2 VolETA Results The team extensively validated their approach on the challenge dataset and compared their results with ground truth meshes using MAPE and Chamfer distance metrics. More Briefly, the team leverages their approach for each food scene separately. A one-shot food volume estimation approach is applied if the number of keyframes k equals 1. Otherwise, a few-shot food volume estimation is applied. The team’s keyframe selection process chooses 34.8% of total frames for the rest of the pipeline, where it shows the minimum frames with the highest information.

The team follows a corner projection matching method. Specifically, using a dense reconstruction model, the team 6 Table 3: Quantitative Comparison of Team’s Approach with Ground Truth L Id Team’s Vol. GT Vol. Ch. w/ t.m Ch. w/o t.m E 1 40.06 38.53 1.63 85.40 2 216.9 280.36 7.12 111.47 3 278.86 249.67 13.69 172.88 4 279.02 295.13 2.03 61.30 5 395.76 392.58 13.67 102.14 6 205.17 218.44 6.68 150.78 7 372.93 368.77 4.70 66.91 8 186.62 173.13 2.98 152.34 M 9 224.08 232.74 3.91 160.07 10 153.76 163.09 2.67 138.45 11 80.4 85.18 3.37 151.14 13 363.99 308.28 5.18 147.53 14 535.44 589.83 4.31 89.66 H 16 163.13 262.15 18.06 28.33 17 224.08 181.36 9.44 28.94 18 25.4 20.58 4.28 12.84 19 110.05 108.35 11.34 23.98 20 130.96 119.83 15.59 31.05 Table 4: Overall Method Performance MAPE Ch. sum w/tm mean Ch. w/o tm mean 10.973 0.130 0.007 1.715 0.095 obtains the pose of each image as well as dense point cloud information. For any image imgk and its extrinsic parameters [R|t]k, the team first performs a threshold-based corner detection with the threshold set to 240. This allows them to obtain the pixel coordinates of all detected corners. Subsequently, using the intrinsic parameters k and the extrinsic parameters [R|t]k, the point cloud is projected onto the image plane. Based on the pixel coordinates of the corners, the team can identify the closest point coordinates P k i for each corner, where i represents the index of the corner. Thus, they can calculate the distance between any two corners as follows: Dij = (P k i −P k j )2 ∀i ̸= j To determine the final computed length of each checkerboard square in image k, the team takes the minimum value of each row of the matrix Dk (excluding the diagonal) to form the vector dk. The median of this vector is then used. The final scale calculation formula is given by the following equation, where 0.012 represents the known length of each square (1.2 cm): scale = 0.012 med(dk) 5.1.2 3D Reconstruction Considering the differences in input viewpoints, the team utilizes two pipelines to process the first fifteen objects and the last five single view objects. For the first fifteen objects, the team uses a Structure from Motion algorithm to estimate the poses and segment the food using the provided segment masks in the dataset. Then, they apply advanced multi-view 3D reconstruction methods to reconstruct the segmented food. In practice, the team employs three different reconstruction methods. They select the best reconstruction results from these methods and extract the mesh from the reconstructed model. Next, they scale the extracted mesh using the estimated scale factor. Finally, they apply some optimization techniques to obtain a refined mesh. 7 For the last five single-view objects, the team experiments with several single-view reconstruction methods. They choose a specific method to obtain a 3D food model consistent with the distribution of the input image. In practice, they use the intrinsic camera parameters from the fifteenth object and employ an optimization method based on reprojection error to refine the extrinsic parameters of the single camera. However, due to the limitations of single-view reconstruction, the team needs to incorporate depth information from the dataset and the checkerboard in the monocular image to determine the size of the extracted mesh. Finally, they apply optimization techniques to obtain a refined mesh. 5.1.3 Mesh refinement In the 3D Reconstruction phase, the team observes that the model’s results often suffer from low quality due to the presence of holes on the object surface and substantial noise. To address the holes, the team employs an optimization method based on computational geometry. For surface noise, they utilize Laplacian Smoothing for mesh smoothing operations. The Laplacian Smoothing method works by adjusting the position of each vertex to the average of its neighboring vertices: V new i = V old i + λ   1 |N(i)| X j∈N(i) V old j −V old i   In their implementation, the team sets the smoothing factor λ to 0.2 and performs 10 iterations. 5.2 Experimental Results 5.2.1 Estimated scale factor The scale factors estimated using the method described earlier are shown in Table 5. Each image and the corresponding reconstructed 3D model yield a scale factor, and the table presents the average scale factor for each object.

Figure 13 illustrates the alignment process for Object 14. First, the team calculates the central points of both the predicted model and the ground truth model, and moves the predicted model to align the central point of the ground truth model. Next, they perform ICP registration for further alignment, significantly reducing the Chamfer distance. Finally, they use gradient descent for additional fine-tuning, and obtain the final transformation matrix. The total Chamfer distance between all 18 predicted models and the ground truths is 0.069441169. 6 Best 3D Mesh Reconstruction Team - FoodRiddle 6.1 Methodology To achieve high-quality food mesh reconstruction, the team designed two pipeline processes. For simple and medium cases, they employed a structure-from-motion approach to determine the pose of each image, followed by mesh reconstruction. Subsequently, a series of post-processing steps were implemented to recalibrate scale and enhance mesh quality. For cases with only a single image, the team utilized image generation methods to aid in model generation. 6.1.1 Multi-View Reconstruction For Structure from Motion (SfM), the team extended the state-of-the-art method by incorporating methodologies. This significantly mitigated the issue of sparse keypoints in weakly textured scenes. For mesh reconstruction, the team’s method is based on a differentiable renderer and incorporates regularization terms for depth distortion and normal consistency. The Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) results are used to generate a dense point cloud. In the post-processing stage, the team applied filtering and outlier removal techniques, identified the contour of the supporting surface, and projected the lower mesh vertices onto the supporting surface. They used the reconstructed checkerboard to rectify the scale of the model and used Poisson reconstruction to generate a watertight, complete mesh of the subject. 6.1.2 Single-View Reconstruction For 3D reconstruction from a single image, the team employed state-of-the-art methods to generate an initial prior mesh. This prior mesh was then jointly corrected with depth structure information. 9 To adjust the scale, the team estimated the object’s length using the checkerboard as a reference, assuming the object and the checkerboard are on the same plane. They then projected the 3D object back onto the original 2D image to recover a more accurate scale of the object. 6.2 Experimental Results Through a process of nonlinear optimization, the team sought to identify a transformation that minimizes the Chamfer distance between their mesh and the ground truth mesh. This optimization aimed to align the two meshes as closely as possible in three-dimensional space. Upon completion of this process, the average Chamfer distance across the final reconstructions of the 20 objects amounted to 0.0032175 meters. As shown in Table 7, Team FoodRiddle achieved the best scores for both multi-view and single-view reconstructions, outperforming other teams in the competition. Table 7: Total Errors for Different Teams on Multi-view and Single-view Data Team Multi-view (1-14) Single-view (16-20) FoodRiddle 0.036362 0.019232 ININ-VIAUN 0.041552 0.027889 VolETA 0.071921 0.058726 7 Conclusion In this report, we provide a summary and analysis of the methodologies and findings from the 3D Food Reconstruction challenge. The primary goal of this challenge was to push the envelope in 3D reconstruction technologies, with an emphasis on the unique challenges presented by food items, such as their varied textures, reflective surfaces, and complex geometries. The competition featured 20 diverse food items, captured under various conditions and with varying numbers of input images, specifically designed to challenge participants in developing robust reconstruction models. The evaluation was based on a two-phase process, assessing both portion size accuracy through Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and shape accuracy using the Chamfer distance metric. Of all participating teams, three made it to the final submission, showcasing a range of innovative solutions. Team VolETA won first place with the overall best performance on both Phase-I and Phase-II, followed by team ININ-VIAUN who won second place. In addition, FoodRiddle team demonstrated superior performance in Phase-II, indicating a competitive and high-caliber field of entries for 3D mesh reconstruction. The challenge has successfully pushed the boundaries of 3D food reconstruction, demonstrating the potential for accurate volume estimation and shape reconstruction in nutritional analysis and food presentation applications. The innovative approaches developed by the participating teams provide a solid foundation for future research in this field, potentially leading to more accurate and user-friendly methods for dietary assessment and monitoring. 10",0,,,,
P055.pdf,"Examining the Initial Experiences of Researchers When Articulating Broader Impact Abstract By mandating a broader impact statement with every submission for this year’s conference, the program chairs at the conference highlighted ethics as a crucial component of AI research. Building on precedents from other fields and a grow- ing awareness within the community, this paper seeks to explore how individual researchers responded to this new requirement. This exploration includes their opinions, their experiences during the drafting process, and their reflections after their papers were accepted. We present survey results and key considerations to inform the next iteration of the broader impact requirement, should it continue to be mandated for future conferences. 1 Introduction There is a growing number of unethical uses of technology. To counter this trend, some proposals suggest limiting investment or procurement without impact assessment, or even calling for outright bans. Other proposals aim to instill ethical practices earlier in the research stage, before technology transfers into products. Conferences that are typically technical have begun to host workshops on social impact issues and, in some instances, have announced more interdisciplinary subject areas. The most significant change may be the requirement for a statement of broader impact for all submissions. Unlike workshops and interdisciplinary tracks, which might be viewed as more specific, this requirement affects every submission, of which there are over 9000 this year. While broader impact statements themselves are not new to the wider research community, they are new to this specific community. This paper seeks to explore how individual researchers responded to the new requirement, including their perspectives, their experiences and process in drafting the statements, and their subsequent thoughts after paper acceptances. This research was initiated through internal discussion at our organization, which then became part of a broader public conversation. To collect perspectives from researchers, both within and beyond our organization, we developed an online public survey. The findings from this survey help to inform considerations for designing the next iteration of the broader impact requirement, should it remain a requirement for future conferences. While it is recognized that researchers are not the only intended audience for these statements, and that others also have responsibilities in ethical research and technology development, researchers represent a critical mass to mobilize in this effort. Understanding the researchers’ experience and process is essential not only to the design of the requirement, but also to advancing ethical research practices in general. 2 Survey Method The study employed an exploratory mixed-methods survey with both open and closed-ended questions. The survey was split into two sections, one for researchers who submitted to the conference, and another for those who did not. The survey was anonymous, and no demographic information was collected. The survey was distributed online via research community channels and on social media. The goals were to understand how researchers considered the implications of their research, how . they defined their impact statements, and to understand their opinions on this new submission requirement. Survey questions focused on their approach to writing the statement, encountered challenges, the perceived influence of the statement on the overall submission, and their views on the new requirement. 3 Survey Results A total of 50 participants responded to the survey, with the majority identifying as academics (72 percent) and industry researchers (23.5 percent). There was a balanced breakdown by career stage, with graduate students making up the largest group of respondents (33 percent). Among the group that submitted, the majority identified their subject areas as deep learning and theory. However, among researchers who did not submit, deep learning and social aspects of machine learning were the primary subject areas. The survey population was not compared to the overall population, though this could be an area for future study. Our questions focused on the process and challenges in completing the submission requirement, the perceived impact of the requirement on paper acceptances, and researchers’ views on the requirement. 3.1 Process and Challenges When asked about their approach to the broader impact statements, 83.8 percent of respondents indicated that they completed this part with their co-authors, without external help. The rest of the participants used other approaches such as accepting support or reaching out for help. A large majority spent less than 2 hours on the statement, and almost half mentioned it was not challenging to prepare. There were differing trends for what could make it difficult. Some viewed their theoretical work as too distant from practical applications, making the exercise speculative. Others perceived the requirement as a ""bureaucratic constraint"". Researchers at different stages of their career found the exercise more or less challenging, but their professional domain did not appear to affect their experienced difficulty with the exercise. 3.2 Impact on Submission Although it was clarified that submissions would not be rejected solely on the basis of the broader impact statement, the survey explored the researcher’s perspectives on this. For researchers who submitted, over 75 percent believed the statements were not taken into consideration, yet almost 90 percent thought it was unclear how reviewers would evaluate the statements. Even with an unclear evaluation process, when asked how confident they were that their statement was adequately addressing the requirement, 43.2 percent stated that they were either confident or very confident. Time spent did not seem to have an impact, since most of the respondents who spent less than an hour also received acceptances. Those who sought external help appeared to have a lower ratio of rejections, but our sample size may be too small to draw conclusive results. 3.3 Framing The survey explored researchers’ views on the requirement and its framing. Our results indicated that the community was divided on how to frame the requirement; 56 percent did not agree that broader impact was the right way to frame the requirement, while 44 percent did. This split was similar when compared to subject area, submitters vs. non-submitters, and academia vs. industry. Postdoctoral/early-career and mid-career respondents were more supportive of the requirement framing than students and senior researchers. There seems to be a general feeling that assessing broader impact is important, but uncertainty regarding who should do it and how. Some respondents described the requirement as ""too broad"" or said they did not feel ""qualified to address the broader impact of their work."" Some who supported the requirement found the thought process to be valuable and that it ""forces researchers to reflect on the impact of their research"". 4 Integrating Feedback into Next Iteration of Broader Impact The survey results inform future iterations of the broader impact requirement. When asked what could have helped them most, 92 percent of respondents indicated that examples of statements 2 would be most helpful. There will be an increasing number of examples to draw from in future years. Guidelines were the second most popular request, regarding when a statement might be applicable or how to formulate one. This section proposes how to integrate respondent feedback into future iterations: rethinking the requirement design and framing, developing greater capacity and confidence among researchers, and reflecting the shared responsibility of ethical research and technology development. 4.1 Requirement Design If the goal is to develop ethical research practices, there may be other approaches to achieve this goal. While written statements make sense given the paper-based nature of submissions, survey respondents indicated a mix of nonchalance, outright farce, or perceived burden. These attitudes may have a counterproductive effect on an ethical research goal. We encourage program chairs to consider mechanisms to limit that effect (e.g., an incentive for ""best"" broader impact statements). Such mechanisms are important not only to manage negative effects but also to encourage researchers who found the exercise valuable. 4.2 Capacity Building Given that many respondents felt they were not qualified to address the broader impact of their work, workshops may help build capacity over time, and provide a space for researchers to examine their work with a more diverse group of researchers. Discussions could help develop capacity and confidence, and surface overlooked impacts. Interdisciplinary collaborations could also introduce new guidelines or methodologies such as the theory of change or consequence scanning. 4.3 Shared Responsibility Recognizing how different systems and social contexts interact would increase the quality of the discussion on broader impact, and develop a sense of shared responsibility for ethical research and technology development. Researchers are a critical mass, but others such as conference organizers, institutions, funders, and users also have roles and responsibilities. To address concerns around burden and expertise, the assessment of broader impact could be more of a multi-stakeholder exercise. 5 Conclusion This paper and its underlying survey investigated how researchers approached the broader impact statement and surfaced considerations to better design this requirement in future years. While the survey represented a small sample of the community, its results demonstrate a division regarding how the requirement is framed. Initiating a conversation about broader impact is itself a step towards establishing norms and best practices for ethical research. We encourage further work to monitor the evolution of researcher’s perspectives, not only at top conferences, but also at-large. 6 Acknowledgements The authors thank Noémie Lachance, Tara Tressel, and the Research Group for their support and participation throughout this project. 7 Supplementary Material The survey questions and the responses received are available for further investigation and use. The survey remains open to responses. At the time of writing, we had 50 responses which were used for the analysis in this paper. 3",1,,,,

The inherent dichotomy between florid extravagance and mundane simplicity has led to a plethora of intriguing conundrums in the realm of logic circuits, which, incidentally, have been observed to possess a peculiar affinity for 19th-century French literary movements, particularly symbolism, as exemplified by the works of Mallarmé, who, in his seminal work, ""Un Coup de Dés,"" inadvertently alluded to the fundamental principles of digital electronics, while simultaneously exploring the human condition through the lens of existentialism, a philosophical framework that, when applied to the design of logic circuits, yields a fascinating array of possibilities, including the integration of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory, which, in turn, have been found to have a profound impact on the behavior of certain types of logic gates, notably the XOR gate, whose truth table, when examined in conjunction with the principles of ancient Greek philosophy, particularly the concept of the Platonic solids, reveals a hidden pattern of relationships that underlie the very fabric of reality, a notion that has been corroborated by recent studies on the application of logic circuits in the field of quantum mechanics, where the principles of superposition and entanglement have been found to possess a strange resemblance to the workings of the human brain, which, as we know, is capable of processing vast amounts of information in a highly parallel and distributed manner, much like the architecture of modern computers, which, in turn, rely heavily on the principles of logic circuits to perform even the most mundane tasks, such as calculating the trajectories of celestial bodies, which, when viewed through the lens of Newtonian mechanics, reveal a intricate dance of gravitational forces that govern the behavior of our universe, a universe that, according to certain theories, may be infinite in scope and complexity, with an infinite number of parallel universes, each with its own unique set of physical laws and properties, a concept that has been explored in various works of science fiction, including the seminal novel ""Diaspora"" by Greg Egan, which, incidentally, explores the theme of artificial intelligence and its potential implications for human society, a theme that is also relevant to the field of logic circuits, where the development of more sophisticated and autonomous systems has raised important questions about the nature of intelligence and consciousness, and the potential risks and benefits associated with the creation of such systems, which, when viewed in the context of the broader societal and cultural landscape, reveal a complex web of relationships and interdependencies that underlie the very fabric of our existence, a notion that has been corroborated by recent studies on the application of logic circuits in the field of sociology, where the principles of network theory and graph theory have been found to possess a strange resemblance to the workings of human social structures, which, as we know, are capable of exhibiting complex and emergent behavior, much like the behavior of certain types of logic circuits, particularly those that incorporate principles of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory, which, in turn, have been found to have a profound impact on the behavior of certain types of complex systems, including economic systems, ecological systems, and even the human brain itself, which, as we know, is capable of processing vast amounts of information in a highly parallel and distributed manner, much like the architecture of modern computers, which, in turn, rely heavily on the principles of logic circuits to perform even the most mundane tasks, such as simulating the behavior of complex systems, which, when viewed through the lens of systems theory, reveal a intricate web of relationships and interdependencies that underlie the very fabric of our existence, a notion that has been corroborated by recent studies on the application of logic circuits in the field of philosophy, where the principles of logic and reason have been found to possess a strange resemblance to the workings of human consciousness, which, as we know, is capable of exhibiting complex and emergent behavior, much like the behavior of certain types of logic circuits, particularly those that incorporate principles of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory.

P057.pdf,"A Collaborative Painting Experience: Human-Machine Interaction on Canvas Abstract We introduce a novel approach to human-machine interaction, framed as a pictorial game where artists and a computer collaborate in iterative creative rounds. The computer uses machine learning to partially complete the artwork at each stage, projecting its additions directly onto the canvas, which the artists are then able to modify or incorporate. This process encourages creative exploration and provokes questions about the growing relationship between humans and machines. 1 Introduction The ongoing technological advancements are reshaping human-machine interaction, providing new tools for artistic creation while simultaneously prompting contemplation on their effects on human creativity. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated the creative abilities of neural networks, producing aesthetically full paintings. However, in these instances, humans serve as either engineers or curators. Our work introduces a new method of machine utilization, integrating it into the core of human creative processes. While painting, this approach presents humans with different paths and concepts for their artwork. This concept is approached through a unique interactive framework. The artist duo Tina and Charly have previously investigated interaction through canvas art. To initiate their creative work, they select a theme and depict it in dark colors on a white canvas. They then start their game. At each round, using a vocabulary of strokes and symbols, Charly anticipates Tina’s emotions and thoughts in red, before responding with green strokes on the painting. These rounds continue until both artists reach an agreement on finishing the painting. The entire process unfolds in silence, with the canvas serving as the sole medium of dialogue. The purpose of our work is to introduce artificial intelligence as a third participant in Tina and Charly’s dialogue. The AI initially captures a raw representation of the painting, then processes it to partially complete the work in progress, which it projects back onto the canvas. The artists then have the freedom to incorporate the machine’s suggestion in blue, a color that has not been assigned to either player. The use of different colors allows for the analysis of each player’s contributions. 2 Methodology The engineered system includes a camera and a projector connected to a computer on a support. At each computer round, the system captures an image of the painting and analyzes it to extract the canvas strokes. This pre-processing is made robust to changes in lighting, ensuring that the interaction can be used seamlessly in any studio. These strokes then feed into a neural sketcher, which produces new strokes to be added to the painting. Post-processing is used to project those additions back onto the canvas. The neural sketcher is a recurrent neural network, based on a recent improvement to the seminal work of previous research. It is trained using a sequence of points and a channel encoding for stroke breaks. The sketcher produces a similar series, which is then converted back into strokes on the original . painting. The network was trained using the QuickDraw data set, enabling it to create human-like strokes. For integration with Tina and Charly’s style, the learning was refined using a sketch database from previous paintings by the artists. 3 Discussion The artists found the machine strokes to be surprising and suggestive of movements they would not have made on their own. Some painters have previously expressed how unintended strokes can be evocative. Our installation, where the machine projects completions without physically painting, and the generative network capabilities, allows this to be explored. Furthermore, the ability to change parameters, such as the learning data set, provides the artist with more control over their usage of the machine. Our interactive installation can be used by anyone and aims to raise awareness and initiate thought about the interplay between humans and machines. This work highlights the need to make machines human-friendly, while also acknowledging how technology changes human behaviors and routines. Tina and Charly felt like they were interacting with a full-body system, which had been designed to simulate human-like painting. They experienced the machine as sometimes restricting, hard to understand, and sometimes magical. It infused new dimensions into the painting. The feeling that the machine could be collaborative or limiting is an echo of the role of technologies in our daily lives. From an outsider’s perspective, the machine changes their original painting style, both in the short term artworks (as seen in Figure 2), and on their long-term body of work, inspiring their machine-free paintings. Even though we have made the machine’s influence explicit with its blue contributions, the interaction is not neutral. 4 Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank Yana Hasson and Yann Labbé for coding insights, Erwan Kerdreux for art history discussions, and Thomas Lartigue for general discussions. 2",0,,,,
P058.pdf,"Enhanced Vocabulary Handling in Recurrent Neural Networks Through Positional Encoding Abstract This research presents a counterintuitive discovery: positional encoding, a high-dimensional representation of temporal indices, improves the learning capabilities of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). While positional encod- ing is well-known for its crucial role in enabling Transformer networks to process sequential data, its application to RNNs, which inherently manage temporal information, seems unnecessary. However, our experiments with synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating positional encoding into RNNs enhances their performance, particularly when dealing with extensive vocabularies that result in numerous low-frequency tokens. A detailed analysis reveals that these infrequent tokens introduce instability to the gradients of standard RNNs, and positional encoding effectively counteracts this instability. These findings highlight a previously unrecognized benefit of positional encoding, extending its utility beyond its conventional function as a temporal marker for Transformers. 1 Introduction Since their introduction, Transformer neural networks have become the preferred method for processing and generating time series data, surpassing traditional models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs). A significant distinction between these two types of models lies in their approach to encoding temporal information, which refers to the sequence of individual data points, or tokens, within the time series. RNNs encode this information by sequentially updating their internal state based on both the current input and the preceding state. Conversely, Transformers do not inherently possess a mechanism to represent the order of data points; thus, they depend on an external system known as positional encoding to provide this temporal context. Positional encoding offers a high-dimensional representation of the temporal indices associated with input data. Its most common implementation involves the use of sinusoidal waves with predetermined frequencies. This method ""timestamps"" input tokens by adding or concatenating these encoding vectors to the corresponding input embeddings. In contrast to RNNs, the temporal representation provided by positional encoding remains unchanged by input values until processed collectively by a network. Although positional encoding has often been viewed as a substitute for the temporal processing capabilities of RNNs when used with Transformers, the two are not inherently incompatible. Inputs to RNNs can be augmented with position-encoding vectors, despite this appearing redundant. The presence of autonomous activities in biological neurons, like neural oscillations, is believed to be significant in time perception and other perceptual processes, as well as in motor control. This study, therefore, investigates the application of positional encoding to the inputs of RNNs using synthetic benchmarks. The results demonstrate that positional encoding helps RNNs manage a more diverse set of discrete inputs, effectively handling a larger vocabulary, compared to those without positional encoding. The contributions of this research are outlined as follows: • Challenges in training RNNs with extensive vocabularies are shown through carefully designed benchmark tasks. This issue, despite its potential implications for practical applications, has not been previously identified or has received minimal attention. • The identified training challenges for RNNs with large vocabularies are explained by gradient instability caused by infrequent tokens, which are inevitable when expanding vocabulary size. • A new effectiveness of positional encoding is revealed by combining it with RNNs, showing it mitigates the large-vocabulary issue by stabilizing RNN gradients against the disruptions caused by infrequent tokens. 2 Related Studies 2.1 Theoretical and Empirical Computational Power of (Vanilla) RNNs Mathematically, RNNs are recognized as Turing-complete, meaning they can simulate any Turing machine if their weights have unlimited precision and are perfectly tuned. Even RNNs with random recurrent and input-to-hidden weights, known as reservoir computers, can achieve universal approximation if their hidden-to-output weights are idealized. These theoretical insights have driven the use of RNNs in processing complex time series like human languages and weather patterns. However, in practical scenarios, RNN weights are limited by finite precision and must be optimized based on a finite set of data observations. These constraints place limitations on the actual capabilities of RNNs. For instance, empirical RNNs cannot store an infinite number of observations in their memory, and the stored information degrades over time. This issue of memory duration has been a focal point for researchers, leading to extensive exploration of RNN architectures that can retain memory for longer periods. More recently, the focus of research on extending memory retention has moved towards continuous-time models. Instead of representing the memory of an input sequence through discrete-time changes in a latent state, these models approximate the input history using a linear combination of orthogonal polynomials in continuous-time space. The coefficients of these polynomials provide a finite-dimensional representation of the input sequence, known as the High-Order Polynomial Projection Operator (HiPPO), and the dynamics of these coefficients can be described by an ordinary differential equation (ODE). This concept of continuous-time memory representation has been further developed into neural state-space models by replacing the fixed state matrix in the ODE with a learnable one, while restricting its structure to a diagonal matrix plus a row-rank matrix. Notably, with further refinements, the latest state-space model has achieved language modeling performance that rivals that of Transformer-based models. 2.2 Positional Encoding Positional encoding serves as a high-dimensional representation of the temporal structures present in input data. The primary need for this type of representation arises from Transformers, which, unlike RNNs, do not have an inherent mechanism for representing the order of inputs. Consequently, input tokens to a Transformer are ""time-stamped"" by adding or concatenating a position-encoding vector. In the initial implementation of the Transformer, token positions were encoded using sinusoidal waves of various predefined frequencies. While this original encoding method is effective for a wide range of tasks, researchers have also explored other possibilities. For instance, the well-known BERT pretraining for natural language processing used learnable embeddings to encode token positions. Some research has also indicated that combining sinusoidal and learnable encoding can enhance model performance. Another approach involves encoding the distance between tokens rather than the time elapsed since the beginning of the sequence. Beyond Transformers, positional encoding is utilized to represent elapsed time in diffusion processes. Furthermore, the effec- tiveness of positional encoding is not restricted to temporal information; previous studies in three-dimensional mesh/point-cloud modeling have shown that sinusoidal transformation of spatial data improves model performance compared to using raw coordinate representations. Despite the extensive use of positional encoding across various areas of machine learning, its application to pure RNNs remains largely unexplored. To the author’s knowledge, only two studies have previously investigated position-encoded RNNs. Karanikolos and Refanidis (2019) found that a position-encoded LSTM outperformed a standard LSTM as well as a shallow Transformer in text summarization tasks. In another study, which predates the introduction of sinusoidal positional encoding in the deep learning community, Vincent-Lamarre et al. (2016) demonstrated that oscillatory signals at random frequencies enhanced the performance of a random RNN (i.e., reservoir computer) in a timing task, evaluating the model’s memory duration by its ability to generate a smoothed output pulse after a specific time interval from an onset signal. Similarly, the time index in time series data has rarely been directly used by RNNs, likely due to its perceived redundancy alongside the functionality of RNNs. As an exception, Neil et al. (2016) introduced a periodic gating mechanism for updating the state and memory cell of LSTM. This periodic gating was scheduled based on a triangular wave interspersed with a plateau at the floor value (= 0.0; the frequency, phase, and duration of the wave phase were learnable parameters). 3 Methods 3.1 Task The impact of positional encoding on RNNs was examined using a reverse-ordering task. In this task, RNNs were trained to reconstruct a sequence of random integers in reverse order. 3.2 Model Architecture The research in this study was based on single-layer gated recurrent units (GRUs), long short-term memory (LSTMs), and a neural state-space model, S4D (S4 with a diagonal state matrix). Each integer in the input sequences was first embedded, then concatenated 2 with the positional encoding, and subsequently fed into the RNN/S4D. After processing the entire input sequence, the network received a command to produce the output. This command was represented by a time-invariant learnable vector and was fed to the RNN in place of the input embedding. The outputs from the RNN/S4D module were linearly projected into classification logits. The cross-entropy loss between these logits and the target sequence was used to optimize the entire network. Model predictions during the testing phase were determined by the argmax of these logits for each time step. This study used the standard sinusoidal positional encoding designed for Transformers. Specifically, each time step t was encoded by the Dpos-dimensional vector, defined as follows: PEt, 2i := sin  t −1 10000 2(i−1) Dpos  (1) PEt, 2i + 1 := cos  t −1 10000 2(i−1) Dpos  (2) For learning stability, the positional encoding was divided by the square root of Dpos/2, ensuring that the encoding vectors had a unit L2-norm. The time step t incremented throughout both the input and output phases (i.e., t = 1, ..., L, L+1, ..., 2L, where L is the input length), without any hard-coded association between the input and output positions. 3.3 Implementation Details Across the experiments, the dimensionality of the hidden layer of the RNNs was set to 512. The embedding of the input integers and the memory cell of the LSTM also had the same dimensionality of 512. Similarly, the hidden dimensionality of S4D was set to 512, while its state size (or the order of the Legendre polynomials) was maintained at the default value of 64. The models were trained for 300,000 iterations using the Adam optimizer with parameters (˘03b21, ˘03b22) := (0.9, 0.999) and no weight decay. The learning rate was linearly warmed up from 0.0 to 0.001 for the first 1,000 iterations, and then annealed according to the cosine schedule. The batch size was 512. All experiments were implemented in PyTorch (ver. 2.1.1) and each training-test trial was executed on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU (with 80GB VRAM). 4 Results 4.1 Key Findings Positional encoding was found to enhance the ability of RNNs to manage a larger vocabulary in the reverse-ordering task. The position-encoded GRU and LSTM successfully reversed input sequences of 64 integers drawn uniformly at random from vocabularies of sizes 32-256 and 256-16,384, respectively, achieving token-wise accuracy above 95%. In contrast, the performance of the standard models without positional encoding deteriorated as the vocabulary size increased. Similarly, positional encoding improved the capacity of S4D to handle large vocabularies. These improvements are also evident in the reduced sequence-wise reconstruction errors, as measured by the Damerau-Levenshtein distance. Neither additional training iterations nor larger batch sizes improved the performance of the standard models. 4.2 Frequency Matters The most noticeable effect of increasing the vocabulary size was the decreased probability of observing individual vocabulary items. Therefore, additional experiments were conducted with non-uniformly distributed tokens to examine the relationship between token frequency and RNN performance. Specifically, the input vocabulary was evenly divided into Frequent and Rare groups, with Frequent tokens having three times the probability of Rare tokens. The probability of each Frequent token was 7/8 ˘00d7 2/K (where K is the total vocabulary size, set to 64, 1024, and 2048 for GRU, LSTM, and S4D, respectively), while the probability of each Rare token was 1/8 ˘00d7 2/K. The training data consisted of 64 independent samples from this dual-frequency vocabulary. The test data were systematically constructed so that each sequence included a single ""target"" token (Frequent/Rare) whose retrieval accuracy was assessed, along with 63 ""disturbants"" that were either all Frequent or all Rare. The experiment revealed that the frequency of the disturbant tokens significantly affected the performance of the standard RNNs and S4D. Rare targets were successfully retrieved as long as they were surrounded by Frequent disturbants. However, the standard GRU struggled to recover Frequent targets when the other input tokens were filled with Rare disturbants. LSTM performance also degraded, especially when targets were positioned in the first quarter of the input sequence (1 ˘2264 t ˘2264 16). Similarly, Rare disturbants were detrimental to S4D; unlike the RNNs, the accuracy was lowest when targets were located in the middle of the input sequences (17 ˘2264 t ˘2264 32). 3 In contrast, the position-encoded RNNs showed robustness to the frequency of both target and disturbant tokens. They achieved nearly perfect accuracies in most cases, except when the GRU processed fully Rare data with the target in the first half of the sequence (1 ˘2264 t ˘2264 32). Likewise, positional encoding enhanced the resilience of S4D against the influence of Rare disturbants. 4.3 Analysis of Gradient Stability To further investigate the influence of token frequency on RNN performance, the gradients of the RNN latent states were analyzed. Pairs of input sequences were processed by RNNs trained on the dual-frequency vocabulary. Each pair shared the same initial token (t = 1; ""target"") but varied in subsequent tokens (2 ˘2264 t ˘2264 L; ""disturbants""). Gradients were then computed for the distant mapping between the first and last updated states (at t = 1 and 2L) of the RNNs using backpropagation through time. The stability of RNN learning was assessed by measuring the dot-product similarity of the gradients between the paired input sequences (after normalization over output dimensions). Formally, the paired input sequences, denoted as A and B, established two distinct, but ideally similar mappings, f(A) and f(B), from the first to the last latent state of the RNNs. The gradient stability of the RNNs was defined by the dot-product similarities between the normalized gradients of these paired mappings: Stability(A, B) := D X i=1 ⟨α(A) i ∇f (A) i (⃗z1), α(B) i ∇f (B) i (⃗z1)⟩= D X i=1 α(A) i α(B) i   2D X j=1 ∂h(A) 2L,i ∂z1,j · ∂h(B) 2L,i ∂z1,j   (3) where the coefficients ˘03b1(s) i normalized the raw gradients ˘2207f (s) i ( z1) over the output dimensions i := 1, . . . , D: α(s) i := v u u u t   2D X j=1 ∂h(s) 2L,i ∂z1,j !2  ,v u u u t   D X k=1   2D X j=1 ∂h(s) 2L,k ∂z1,j !2    (4) Consequently, the stability metric emphasizes the consistency of the paired gradients that both have a greater L2-norm across the output dimensions. It is important to note that the mapping from the first to the last RNN state was conditioned on the disturbant tokens occurring at 2 ˘2264 t ˘2264 L. Nevertheless, the reverse-ordering task trained the networks to retrieve the initial token as their final output regardless of the intervening tokens. Thus, a well-trained RNN would maintain invariance in its final state over the disturbants. Conversely, consistent gradient directions across varied disturbants would lead to successful learning, which is the premise of the proposed analysis. Unlike the RNN models, both the standard and position-encoded S4Ds achieved high accuracy over 96% for the initial target token (t = 1), regardless of the frequency of the target and disturbants. Therefore, for the analysis of S4D, the target token was positioned in the middle at t = 23, where the standard model exhibited its poorest accuracy with Rare disturbants. The disturbants were prefixed and suffixed to this target to construct input sequences. The prefix disturbants were shared between the paired sequences, ensuring that the latent dynamics of the model remained identical up to the target token. It should also be noted that the latent states of S4D are complex-valued (while its outputs are real-valued), and consequently, the gradients and their dot-product similarities are also complex-valued. For this analysis, the complex-valued gradients were treated as double-sized real arrays, and a real-valued similarity was defined by Eq. 3. This is equivalent to taking the real component of the complex-valued similarity and is intuitively natural given that a perfect alignment between complex gradient directions yields a real-valued score of 1.0. Additionally, the extra dimension in the latent states representing the order of the Legendre polynomials was merged with the channel dimension, and the entire state was treated as a flattened vector. Monitoring the gradients at training checkpoints revealed that Rare disturbants destabilize the learning of standard RNNs. The similarity of the paired gradients decreased gradually (GRU) or rapidly (LSTM) when the networks were exposed to Rare disturbants. Most notably, positional encoding endowed the RNNs with robustness to these Rare disturbants. Both the GRU and LSTM maintained high similarity of the paired gradients across different target/disturbant conditions. In contrast, the impact of positional encoding on the gradient stability of S4D was marginal; unlike the RNNs, the standard S4D was highly stable by itself against Rare disturbants throughout training, although there was a visible relative destabilization due to Rare disturbants compared to Frequent disturbants in the early stages of training, as well as an observable improvement by positional encoding. It is also noteworthy that the difference between Frequent and Rare disturbants diminished after 10,000 training iterations. Consequently, gradient stability does not fully account for the decline in S4D accuracy in the presence of Rare disturbants, nor does it explain the enhancement brought about by positional encoding. 4 5 Discussion 5.1 Difficulties in Handling a Large Vocabulary This study introduced a novel challenge in training standard RNNs: large vocabularies. While investigating the manageable vocabulary size of RNNs appears to be a relevant research area, crucial for practical applications like natural language processing, previous studies have primarily focused on evaluating and improving the memory duration of RNNs, typically setting the vocabulary size to a small value (= 8). This research examined RNN gradients and identified their destabilization when processing low-frequency tokens, which are necessarily included in a large vocabulary. Specifically, inputs that do not contribute to gradient-based optimization at a target time step (e.g., tokens at 2 ˘2264 t ˘2264 L upon the retrieval of the initial token at t = 2L in the reverse-ordering task) were found to be detrimental. In general time series processing, data points carrying crucial information for specific time steps become irrelevant otherwise. Consequently, each token exhibits a dual nature—both crucial and noisy—throughout the task. Processing rare tokens is particularly challenging, presumably because they are irrelevant most of the time while making a large impact on learning through the greater loss to compensate for their fewer learning opportunities. Dealing with such ""unignorable noise"" presents a pervasive challenge for RNNs. 5.2 Functionality of Positional Encoding beyond the Timekeeper for Transformers Although low-frequency tokens destabilize the gradient-based learning of RNNs, this study also discovered that this issue can be alleviated by positional encoding. This enhancement of RNNs via positional encoding is noteworthy because RNNs were specifically designed to process time series data on their own; hence, unlike Transformers, they are presumed to function without relying on an ""external clock"". Consequently, position-encoded RNNs have remained largely unexplored, with only two exceptions to the best of the author’s knowledge. The findings of this study—namely, the improvement in the manageable vocabulary size due to enhanced gradient stability—broaden the currently limited understanding of the impact of positional encoding on RNNs. Additionally, the results of this study shed new light on the utility of positional encoding. While positional encoding has been viewed as nothing more than input timestamps for Transformers, this study demonstrated its effectiveness in stabilizing the gradients of RNNs against disruption by low-frequency tokens. This novel functionality of positional encoding would not have been visible in Transformer studies, as the model can dynamically adjust the relevance of input tokens through their attention mechanism and thus inherently mitigate the impact of disturbant tokens. 5.3 Limitations and Future Directions A primary unresolved question in this study pertains to the mechanism behind the gradient stabilization by positional encoding. All findings here are based on experimental investigations, lacking rigorous mathematical explanations for how and why the gradients of RNNs are destabilized by infrequent tokens and stabilized by positional encoding. Moreover, this study primarily focused on the canonical implementation of sinusoidal positional encoding designed for Transformers (Eqs. 1, 2), leaving it open which parameters of the sinusoidal waves (i.e., frequencies and phases) are critical for gradient stabilization. Future research may broaden its scope to encompass more general forms of positional encoding, such as wavelets and non-periodic signals. Moreover, the analysis of gradient stability did not fully address the enhanced performance of the position-encoded state-space model (S4D). In terms of accuracy, the positioned-encoded S4D exhibited greater robustness to infrequent tokens compared to the standard model, resembling the behavior observed in RNNs. However, the gradients of the standard S4D were too stable to account for this decline in performance. This leaves open the question of how positional encoding influences gradient-based learning of state-space models. Additionally, future studies may investigate a broader range of state-space models—including the state-of-the-art architecture of Mamba—to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between positional encoding and these models. In addition to these scientifically oriented questions, future studies could also address practical applications of position-encoded RNNs and neural state-space models. Although positional encoding enhanced model performance across different synthetic tasks, the extent of this enhancement is task-dependent. Indeed, while a previous study reported the effectiveness of positional encoding for an LSTM text summarizer, the present study found no empirical advantage for the language modeling task, aside from a slightly more rapid decline in training loss. Thus, positional encoding is not a panacea for arbitrary tasks, and further investigations are necessary to determine when it is effective. 6 Appendix 6.1 A Other Tasks This section demonstrates the effectiveness of positional encoding on RNNs across different tasks, besides the reverse ordering task discussed in the main text. 5 6.1.1 A.1 Reverse-Ordering + Delayed-Addition This section reports the performance of position-encoded RNNs on a more complicated, combinatorial task than the reverse ordering of input sequences. Extending the reverse-ordering task, the models received additional random input integers during the output phase, and added each of them to the corresponding token in the reverse-ordered input sequence (modulo the vocabulary size, so that the output range was bounded). This task was too challenging to GRUs—even after reducing the input length to L = 16—so only the results from LSTMs are reported below. Also, the network was trained for 600,000 iterations (i.e., twice longer than the other tasks) for ensuring the convergence. The other conditions/hyperparameters were the same as reported in the main text. Consequently, positional encoding improved the model performance as the vocabulary size grew from 896 to 1088. 6.1.2 A.2 Sorting In the reverse ordering task, the order of input integers was important information for accomplishing the task. Thus, positional encoding may play its originally intended role in encoding the temporal information. This section reports the effectiveness of positional encoding for a task in which the order of input observations was completely irrelevant; the learning objective was to simply sort the input integers in their inherent ascending order (e.g. 8, 29, 2, 11 ˘2192 2, 8, 11, 29). The input integers were uniformly randomly sampled with replacement, allowing for ties in the sorting process. As a result, positional encoding also proved effective for RNNs to handle a larger vocabulary in the sorting task, though the improvement remained marginal compared to the reverse-ordering task. 6.1.3 A.3 Predecessor Query Finally, this section presents benchmark results for the predecessor-query task. The network first received a sequence of non-repeating random integers, x1, . . . , xL. Subsequently, one of the non-initial input integers, xtquery (2 ˘2264 tquery ˘2264 L), was randomly selected and reintroduced to the network at time t = L + 1. The learning objective is to return the predecessor of the reviewed integer (= xtquery˘22121). The predecessor-query task evaluates the capacity of RNNs to integrate information regarding both the order and content of input sequences. As in the reverse-ordering + delayed-addition task, the input sequence was reduced to L = 16 due to the complexity of the task, and the experiment focused on the LSTM. The number of training iterations was maintained at 300,000. Similar to the other benchmarks, positional encoding improved the LSTM’s capacity to manage the larger vocabularies. 6.2 B Robustness to Variations in Input Length So far, all the tasks were experimented using fixed-length inputs (L = 64). One might wonder if positional encoding is exceptionally effective under this setting, informing RNNs with the exact timing when each input token should be returned as the output. Thus, it remains unclear whether or not position-encoded RNNs can also handle a larger vocabulary even when the input length is variable and, thus, the exact timing of the output emission is not identifiable from the positional encoding attached to the inputs. To assess the robustness to variations in the input length, an additional experiment was conducted on the LSTM, with the input length varied between 32 and 64. In this setup, the maximum input length (= 64) covers the entirety of the shortest input sequence plus its reversed reconstruction (= 32 + 32). Consequently, the positional encoding per se cannot even distinguish the input vs. output phases at t = 33, . . . , 64. The vocabulary size was set to 16,384. As a result, the positional encoding still improved the LSTM’s performance on the reverse-ordering task against the perturbations in the input length. This result suggests that the effectiveness of the positional encoding for RNNs is not limited to strictly scheduled tasks. 6.3 C Effects of Additional Parameters in Position-Encoded RNNs The concatenation of positional encoding with input embeddings inflates the number of learnable parameters in the input-to-hidden projection weights. This additional parameterization per se does not influence the learning of the input embeddings, and therefore does not elucidate the enhanced performance of position-encoded RNNs. This section substantiates this argument by equalizing the number of learnable parameters between the standard and position-encoded models. Specifically, the equalization was achieved by concatenating two identical copies of the input embeddings and feeding them to the LSTM. This configuration—henceforth termed ""double standard""—effectively doubled the size of the input- to-hidden weight for each gate in the LSTM, aligning it with that of the position-encoded LSTM, while maintaining all other parameters, including the dimensionality of the (non-repeated) input embeddings. The double standard LSTM did not yield any improvements in the reverse-ordering or sort- ing tasks. These results affirm that the reported enhancement of RNNs is not merely attributable to the additional parameterization associated with the positional encoding. 6 6.4 D Alternative Implementations of Positional Encoding While this study implemented positional encoding by sinusoidal waves, there are alternative implementations proposed in the previous studies. For instance, the BERT-based models typically encode each token position by a learnable embedding. Moreover, it has been pointed out that even random vectors can function as positional encoding. Accordingly, these two alternative forms of positional encoding were tested on the LSTM performing the reverse- ordering task. The random position-encoding vectors were uniformly and independently sampled from the (512 - 1)- dimensional hypersphere. The learnable embeddings were implemented using the canonical embedding module of PyTorch (torch.nn.Embedding). The input length and vocabulary size were set to 64 and 16,384 respectively. Both the random vectors and learnable embeddings improved the performance of LSTM. Among the different implementations of positional encoding, the sinusoidal encoding outperformed the two alterna- tives. The advantage of the sinusoidal encoding became more apparent when the input length was variable between 32 and 64; the sinusoidal encoding was more robust to the variations in the input length than the others. 6.5 E Language Modeling This section reports benchmark results for the language modeling task. Single-layer LSTMs with and without sinusoidal positional encoding were trained and tested on the WikiText-103 dataset. Due to constraints in computational resources, the vocabulary was reduced from the original size of 267,735 to 32,768 by retokenizing the raw data using SentencePiece. The headings were removed, and the main text was segmented by paragraphs (separated by the line break). Additionally, only the first 1024 tokens of each paragraph were utilized for training and testing, ensuring that the absolute positional encoding always aligned with the beginning of each paragraph. The hyperparameters were configured as specified in Section 3.3. Positional encoding proved effective only for marginally faster learning during the initial phase of training. The difference diminished around 10,000/30,000 iterations, and the test perplexities of the position-encoded model were inferior to those of the standard model.

P059.pdf,"Large Vocabulary Handling in Recurrent Neural Networks Enhanced by Positional Encoding Abstract This research presents a counterintuitive discovery: positional encoding, a high- dimensional representation of time indices on input data, improves the learning capabilities of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Although positional encoding is widely recognized for complementing Transformer neural networks by enabling them to process data order, its application to RNNs seems unnecessary because RNNs inherently encode temporal information. However, our analysis using syn- thetic benchmarks shows that combining positional encoding with RNNs offers advantages, especially when dealing with extensive vocabularies that include low- frequency tokens. Further investigation reveals that these infrequent tokens cause instability in the gradients of standard RNNs, and positional encoding helps to miti- gate this instability. These findings highlight a new function of positional encoding beyond its well-known role as a timekeeping mechanism for Transformers. 1 Introduction Since their introduction, Transformer neural networks have become the preferred method for pro- cessing and generating time series data, surpassing traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs). A significant difference between these models is their handling of temporal information, that is, the sequence of data points or tokens. RNNs process temporal information by adjusting their internal state based on new inputs and their existing state. Conversely, Transformers lack an intrinsic mecha- nism for understanding data sequence order and, therefore, depend on an external system known as positional encoding to keep track of time. Positional encoding represents time indices in a high-dimensional format. A common method involves using sinusoidal waves of predetermined frequencies. This method marks input tokens by adding or appending these vectors to the input embeddings. Unlike RNNs, positional encoding’s time representation remains constant regardless of input values until processed by a network. Although positional encoding is often viewed as a way to represent time that can replace RNNs when used with Transformers, it is not incompatible with RNNs. Inputs to RNNs can be augmented with position-encoding vectors. Autonomous activities in biological neurons, such as oscillations, are believed to be important for time perception and other perceptual processes, as well as motor control. This study, therefore, investigates the effects of adding positional encoding to the inputs of RNNs, using synthetic benchmarks. The results demonstrate that positional encoding helps RNNs manage a more extensive range of discrete inputs, or a larger vocabulary, compared to those without positional encoding. The key contributions of this research are outlined below: • It illustrates the challenges faced when training RNNs on large vocabularies using carefully designed benchmark tasks, a problem that has not been widely recognized or addressed in previous research, despite its potential impact on practical applications. . • It explains that the difficulties in training RNNs with extensive vocabularies are due to gradient instability caused by infrequent tokens, which inevitably occur as vocabulary size increases. • It introduces a novel use of positional encoding, beyond its typical role in timing for Transformers, by integrating it with RNNs. It shows that positional encoding helps alleviate issues related to large vocabularies by stabilizing RNN gradients against the disruptions caused by infrequent tokens. 2 Related Studies 2.1 Theoretical and Empirical Computational Power of (Vanilla) RNNs Mathematically, RNNs are recognized as being Turing-complete, capable of simulating Turing machines if their weights are infinitely precise and perfectly tuned. In practice, however, RNN weights are limited by finite precision and the need to optimize based on a finite set of observations. These constraints impose practical limitations on the capabilities of RNNs. For instance, empirical RNNs cannot store an infinite number of observations in their memory, and the memorized information tends to degrade over time. More recently, research into extending memory retention has explored continuous-time models. Instead of modifying a latent state in discrete-time steps, these models use a linear combination of orthogonal polynomials in a continuous-time domain to approximate the input history. The coefficients of these polynomials provide a finite-dimensional representation of the input sequence, known as the High-Order Polynomial Projection Operator (HiPPO), and the dynamics of these coefficients can be described by an ordinary differential equation (ODE). This concept has been further developed into neural state-space models by replacing the fixed state matrix in the ODE with a learnable one, constrained to a diagonal structure plus a row-rank matrix. With additional enhancements, the latest state-space models have shown language modeling performance that rivals Transformer-based models. 2.2 Positional Encoding Positional encoding serves as a high-dimensional representation of the temporal structures present in input data. This method is particularly crucial for Transformers, which, unlike RNNs, do not inherently capture the order of inputs. Therefore, input tokens to a Transformer are ""time-stamped"" by adding or concatenating a position-encoding vector. In the initial implementation of the Transformer, token positions were represented using sinusoidal waves of various predefined frequencies. Although this method is effective for a wide range of tasks, researchers have explored other encoding schemes as well. For instance, the well-known BERT pretraining for natural language processing used learnable embeddings to indicate token positions. Some studies have suggested that combining sinusoidal and learnable encodings can enhance model performance. Another approach is to encode the distance between tokens instead of the time elapsed from the sequence’s beginning. Beyond Transformers, positional encoding is used to indicate elapsed time in diffusion processes. Its effectiveness is not limited to temporal information; studies on three-dimensional mesh and point-cloud modeling have shown that sinusoidal transformation of spatial data outperforms raw coordinate representation. Despite its widespread use across various areas of machine learning, the application of positional encoding to pure RNNs has been largely unexplored. To the author’s knowledge, only a few studies have investigated position-encoded RNNs. The time index in time series data has rarely been directly used by RNNs, likely due to perceived redundancy alongside RNN functionalities. 2 3 Methods 3.1 Task The impact of positional encoding on RNNs was examined using a reverse-ordering task. In this task, RNNs were trained to reconstruct a sequence of random integers in reverse order (e.g., given 8, 29, 2, 11, the output should be 11, 2, 29, 8). 3.2 Model Architecture This study’s investigations were based on single-layer gated recurrent units (GRUs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and a neural state-space model, S4D. Each integer in the input sequences was first embedded, concatenated with its positional encoding, and then fed into the RNN or S4D. After processing the entire input sequence, the network received a command to produce the output, represented by a time-invariant learnable vector. The outputs from the RNN or S4D module were linearly projected into classification logits, and the cross-entropy loss against the target sequence was used to optimize the entire network. Model predictions during testing were determined by the argmax of these logits for each time step. The canonical sinusoidal positional encoding used for Transformers was adopted in this study. Specifically, each time step t was encoded by a Dpos-dimensional vector, (PEt,1, ..., PEt,Dpos)T , defined as follows: PEt,2i := sin t −1 10000 2(i−1) Dpos ! (1) PEt,2i+1 := cos t −1 10000 2(i−1) Dpos ! (2) For learning stability, the positional encoding was normalized by dividing it by p Dpos/2, ensuring the encoding vectors had a unit L2-norm. The time step t incremented throughout both input and output phases (i.e., t = 1, ..., L, L + 1, ..., 2L, where L is the input length), without any hard-coded link between input and output positions. 3.3 Implementation Details Across the experiments, the dimensionality of the hidden layer of the RNNs was set to 512. The embedding of the input integers and the memory cell of the LSTM also had the same dimensionality of 512. Similarly, the hidden dimensionality of S4D was set to 512, while its state size (or the order of the Legendre polynomials) was maintained at the default value of 64. The models were trained for 300,000 iterations using the Adam optimizer with parameters (β1, β2) := (0.9, 0.999) and no weight decay. The learning rate was linearly warmed up from 0.0 to 0.001 for the first 1,000 iterations, and then annealed according to the cosine schedule. The batch size was 512. All experiments were implemented in PyTorch (ver. 2.1.1). 4 Results 4.1 Key Findings Positional encoding improved the ability of RNNs to handle a larger vocabulary in the reverse-ordering task. The position-encoded GRU and LSTM successfully reversed input sequences of 64 integers drawn uniformly at random from vocabularies of size 32-256 and 256-16,384, respectively, achieving token-wise accuracy above 95%. In contrast, the performance of the vanilla models without positional encoding degraded as the vocabulary size increased. Similarly, positional encoding enhanced the capacity of S4D to handle large vocabularies. These improvements are also evident in the reduced sequence-wise reconstruction errors, measured by the Damerau-Levenshtein distance. Neither extra training iterations nor greater batch sizes improved the performance of the vanilla models. 3 4.2 Frequency Matters The most apparent consequence of the increased vocabulary size was the reduced chance of observing individual vocabulary items. Accordingly, additional experiments were conducted with non-uniformly distributed tokens to investigate the relation between their frequency and RNN performance. Specif- ically, the input vocabulary was evenly divided into Frequent and Rare groups, and the Frequent tokens had three times the probability of the Rare tokens. The training data consisted of 64 independent samples from this dual-frequency vocabulary. By contrast, the test data were systematically constructed so that each sequence included a single ""target"" token (Frequent/Rare) whose retrieval was evaluated for accuracy assessment, along with 63 ""disturbants"" that were either all Frequent or all Rare. The experiment revealed that it was the disturbant tokens whose frequency significantly impacted the performance of the vanilla RNNs and S4D. On the one hand, the Rare targets were successfully retrieved as long as they were surrounded by the Frequent disturbants. On the other hand, the vanilla GRU struggled to recover the Frequent targets when the other input tokens were filled with the Rare disturbants. The LSTM performance was also degraded, especially when the targets were positioned in the first quarter of the input sequence (1 ≤t ≤16). Similarly, the Rare disturbants were detrimental to the S4D; unlike the RNNs, however, the accuracy was worst when the targets were located in the middle of the input sequences (17 ≤t ≤ 32). In contrast, the position-encoded RNNs exhibited robustness to the frequency of the target and disturbant tokens. They achieved nearly perfect accuracies in most cases, except when the GRU processed the fully Rare data whose target was located in the first half of the sequence (1 ≤t ≤ 32). Likewise, positional encoding enhanced the resilience of the S4D against the influence of Rare disturbants. 4.3 Analysis of Gradient Stability To delve deeper into the influence of token frequency on RNN performance, the gradients of the RNN latent states were scrutinized. In the analysis, pairs of input sequences were processed by the RNNs trained on the dual-frequency vocabulary (comprising Frequent and Rare items). Each pair of sequences shared the same initial token (t = 1; ""target"") but varied in the subsequent tokens (2 ≤t ≤L; ""disturbants""). Then, gradients were computed for the distant mapping between the first and last updated states (i.e., at time t = 1 and 2L) of the RNNs using backpropagation through time. The stability of RNN learning was assessed by measuring the dot-product similarity of the gradients between the paired input sequences (after normalization over output dimensions). Formally, the paired input sequences, denoted as A and B, established two distinct, but ideally similar mappings, f (A) and f (B), from the first to the last latent state of the RNNs (˜h(s) 2L = f (s)(˜z1), where s ∈{A, B}). The gradient stability of the RNNs was defined by the dot-product similarities between the normalized gradients of these paired mappings: Stability(A, B) := D X i=1 ⟨α(A) i ∇f (A) i (˜z1), α(B) i ∇f (B) i (˜z1)⟩= D X i=1 α(A) i α(B) i ∂h(A) 2L,i ∂z1,j · ∂h(B) 2L,i ∂z1,j ! (1) where the coefficients α(s) i normalized the raw gradients ∇f (s) i (˜z1) over the output dimensions i := 1, ..., D: α(s) i := v u u u t 2D X j=1 ∂h(s) 2L,i ∂z1,j !2,v u u u t D X k=1 2D X j=1 ∂h(s) 2L,k ∂z1,j !2 (2) Monitoring the gradients at training checkpoints revealed that Rare disturbants destabilize the learning of vanilla RNNs. The similarity of the paired gradients decreased gradually (GRU) or rapidly (LSTM) when the networks were exposed to the Rare disturbants. Positional encoding endowed the RNNs with robustness to these RARE disturbants. Both the GRU and LSTM maintained the high similarity of the paired gradients across the different target/disturbant conditions. By contrast, the impact of positional encoding on the gradient stability of the S4D was marginal; unlike the RNNs, the vanilla S4D was highly stable by itself against Rare disturbants throughout the training, even though there 4 was a visible relative destabilization due to Rare disturbants compared to Frequent disturbants in the early stages of training, as well as an observable improvement by positional encoding. 5 Discussion 5.1 Difficulties in Handling a Large Vocabulary This study introduces a novel challenge in training (vanilla) RNNs: managing large vocabularies. While the manageable vocabulary size of RNNs is a pertinent research area, crucial for empirical applications like natural language processing, previous studies have primarily focused on evaluating and improving the memory duration of RNNs, typically with small vocabulary sizes. This research examined RNN gradients and identified their destabilization when processing low- frequency tokens, which are necessarily included in a large vocabulary. Specifically, inputs that do not contribute to gradient-based optimization at a target time step were found to be detrimental. In general time series processing, data points carrying crucial information for specific time steps become irrelevant otherwise. Consequently, each token exhibits a dual nature—both crucial and noisy—throughout the task. Processing rare tokens is particularly challenging, presumably because they are irrelevant most of the time while making a large impact on learning due to their greater loss, compensating for fewer learning opportunities. Dealing with such ""unignorable noise"" presents a pervasive challenge for RNNs. 5.2 Functionality of Positional Encoding beyond the Timekeeper for Transformers Although low-frequency tokens destabilize the gradient-based learning of RNNs, this study also discovered that positional encoding can alleviate this issue. This enhancement of RNNs via positional encoding is noteworthy because RNNs were specifically designed to process time series data on their own. Unlike Transformers, they are presumed to function without relying on an ""external clock"". Consequently, position-encoded RNNs have remained largely unexplored. The findings of the present study—namely, the improvement in the manageable vocabulary size due to enhanced gradient stability—broaden the currently limited understanding of the impact of positional encoding on RNNs. Additionally, the results of this study shed new light on the utility of positional encoding. While positional encoding has been viewed as nothing more than input timestamps for Transformers, the present study demonstrated its efficacy in stabilizing the gradients of RNNs against disruption by low-frequency tokens. This novel functionality of positional encoding would not have been visible in Transformer studies, as the model can dynamically adjust the relevance of input tokens through their attention mechanism, thus inherently mitigating the impact of disturbant tokens. 5.3 Limitations and Future Directions A primary unresolved question in this study pertains to the mechanism behind the gradient stabilization by positional encoding. All the findings here are based on experimental investigations, lacking rigorous mathematical explanations for how and why the gradients of RNNs are destabilized by infrequent tokens and stabilized by positional encoding. Moreover, the present study primarily focused on the canonical implementation of sinusoidal positional encoding designed for Transformers, leaving open which parameters of the sinusoidal waves (i.e., frequencies and phases) are critical for gradient stabilization. Future research may broaden its scope to encompass more general forms of positional encoding, such as wavelets and non-periodic signals. Moreover, the analysis of gradient stability did not fully address the enhanced performance of the position-encoded state-space model (S4D). In terms of accuracy, the positioned-encoded S4D exhibited greater robustness to infrequent tokens compared to the vanilla model, resembling the behavior observed in RNNs. However, the gradients of the vanilla S4D were too stable to account for this decline in performance. This leaves open the question of how positional encoding influences gradient-based learning of state-space models. Additionally, future studies may investigate a broader range of state-space models to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between positional encoding and these models. 5 In addition to these scientifically oriented questions, future studies could also address practical applications of position-encoded RNNs and neural state-space models. Although positional encoding enhanced model performance across different synthetic tasks, the extent of this enhancement is task- dependent. Thus, positional encoding is not a panacea for arbitrary tasks, and further investigations are necessary to determine when it is effective. 6 Appendix 6.1 Other Tasks This section demonstrates the effectiveness of positional encoding on RNNs across different tasks, besides the reverse ordering task discussed in the main text. 6.1.1 Reverse-Ordering + Delayed-Addition This section reports the performance of position-encoded RNNs on a more complicated, combinatorial task than the reverse ordering of input sequences. Extending the reverse-ordering task, the models received additional random input integers during the output phase, and added each of them to the corresponding token in the reverse-ordered input sequence (modulo the vocabulary size, so that the output range was bounded). This task was too challenging to GRUs—even after reducing the input length to L = 16—so only the results from LSTMs are reported below. Also, the network was trained for 600,000 iterations (i.e., twice longer than the other tasks) for ensuring the convergence. The other conditions/hyperparameters were the same as reported in the main text. Consequently, positional encoding improved the model performance as the vocabulary size grew from 896 to 1088. 6.1.2 Sorting In the reverse ordering task, the order of input integers was important information for accomplishing the task. Thus, positional encoding may play its originally intended role in encoding the temporal information. This section reports the effectiveness of positional encoding for a task in which the order of input observations was completely irrelevant; the learning objective was to simply sort the input integers in their inherent ascending order (e.g. 8, 29, 2, 11 -> 2, 8, 11, 29). The input integers were uniformly randomly sampled with replacement, allowing for ties in the sorting process. As a result, positional encoding also proved effective for RNNs to handle a larger vocabulary in the sorting task, though the improvement remained marginal compared to the reverse-ordering task. 6.1.3 Predecessor Query Finally, this section presents benchmark results for the predecessor-query task. The network first received a sequence of non-repeating random integers, x1, ..., xL. Subsequently, one of the non-initial input integers, xtquery (2 ≤tquery ≤L), was randomly selected and reintroduced to the network at time t = L + 1. The learning objective is to return the predecessor of the reviewed integer (= xtquery−1). The predecessor-query task evaluates the capacity of RNNs to integrate information regarding both the order and content of input sequences. As in the reverse-ordering + delayed-addition task, the input sequence was reduced to L = 16 due to the complexity of the task, and the experiment focused on the LSTM. The number of training iterations was maintained at 300,000. Similar to the other benchmarks, positional encoding improved the LSTM’s capacity to manage the larger vocabularies. 6.2 Robustness to Variations in Input Length So far, all the tasks were experimented using fixed-length inputs (L = 64). One might wonder if positional encoding is exceptionally effective under this setting, informing RNNs with the exact timing when each input token should be returned as the output. Thus, it remains unclear whether or not position-encoded RNNs can also handle a larger vocabulary even when the input length is variable and, thus, the exact timing of the output emission is not identifiable from the positional encoding attached to the inputs. 6 To assess the robustness to variations in the input length, an additional experiment was conducted on the LSTM, with the input length varied between 32 and 64. In this setup, the maximum input length (= 64) covers the entirety of the shortest input sequence plus its reversed reconstruction (= 32 + 32). Consequently, the positional encoding per se cannot even distinguish the input vs. output phases at t = 33, ..., 64. The vocabulary size was set to 16,384. As a result, the positional encoding still improved the LSTM’s performance on the reverse-ordering task against the perturbations in the input length. This result suggests that the effectiveness of the positional encoding for RNNs is not limited to strictly scheduled tasks. 6.3 Effects of Additional Parameters in Position-Encoded RNNs The concatenation of positional encoding with input embeddings inflates the number of learnable parameters in the input-to-hidden projection weights. This additional parameterization per se does not influence the learning of the input embeddings, and therefore does not elucidate the enhanced performance of position-encoded RNNs. This section substantiates this argument by equalizing the number of learnable parameters between the vanilla and position-encoded models. Specifically, the equalization was achieved by concatenating two identical copies of the input embeddings and feeding them to the LSTM. This configuration—henceforth termed ""double vanilla""—effectively doubled the size of the input- to-hidden weight for each gate in the LSTM, aligning it with that of the position-encoded LSTM, while maintaining all other parameters, including the dimensionality of the (non-repeated) input embeddings. As illustrated, the double vanilla LSTM did not yield any improvements in the reverse-ordering or sort- ing tasks. These results affirm that the reported enhancement of RNNs is not merely attributable to the additional parameterization associated with the positional encoding. 6.4 Alternative Implementations of Positional Encoding While this study implemented positional encoding by sinusoidal waves, there are alternative imple- mentations proposed in the previous studies. For instance, the BERT-based models typically encode each token position by a learnable embedding. Moreover, the original study of Transformer pointed out that even random vectors can function as positional encoding. Accordingly, these two alternative forms of positional encoding were tested on the LSTM performing the reverse- ordering task. The random position-encoding vectors were uniformly and independently sampled from the (512 1)- dimensional hypersphere.

The advantage of the sinusoidal encoding became more apparent when the input length was variable between 32 and 64; the sinusoidal encoding was more robust to the variations in the input length than the others. 6.5 Language Modeling This section reports benchmark results for the language modeling task. Single-layer LSTMs with and without sinusoidal positional encoding were trained and tested on the WikiText-103 dataset.

Additionally, only the first 1024 tokens of each paragraph were utilized for training and testing, ensuring that the absolute positional encoding always aligned with the beginning of each paragraph.

The difference diminished around 10,000/30,000 iterations, and the test perplexities of the position-encoded model were inferior to those of the vanilla model. 7 Table 1: Test perplexities on the WikiText-103 dataset.

P060.pdf,"Background Modeling Using Adaptive Pixelwise Kernel Variances in a Hybrid Feature Space Abstract Recent work on background subtraction has shown developments on two major fronts. In one, there has been increasing sophistication of probabilistic models, from mixtures of Gaussians at each pixel, to kernel density estimates at each pixel, and more recently to joint domain-range density estimates that incorporate spatial information. Another line of work has shown the benefits of increasingly complex feature representations, including the use of texture information, local binary patterns, and recently scale-invariant local ternary patterns. In this work, we use joint domain-range based estimates for background and foreground scores and show that dynamically choosing kernel variances in our kernel estimates at each individual pixel can significantly improve results. We give a heuristic method for selectively applying the adaptive kernel calculations which is nearly as accurate as the full procedure but runs much faster. We combine these modeling improvements with recently developed complex features and show significant improvements on a standard backgrounding benchmark. 1 Introduction Background modeling is often an important step in detecting moving objects in video sequences. A common approach to background modeling is to define and learn a background distribution over feature values at each pixel location and then classify each image pixel as belonging to the background process or not. The distributions at each pixel may be modeled in a parametric manner using a mixture of Gaussians or using non-parametric kernel density estimation. More recently, models that allow a pixel’s spatial neighbors to influence its distribution have been developed by joint domain-range density estimation. These models that allow spatial influence from neighboring pixels have been shown to perform better than earlier neighbor-independent models. Also, the use of an explicit foreground model along with a background model can be useful. In a manner similar to theirs, we use a kernel estimate to obtain the background and foreground scores at each pixel location using data samples from a spatial neighborhood around that location from previous frames. The background score is computed as a kernel estimate depending on the distance in the joint domain-range space between the estimation point and the samples in the background model. A similar estimate is obtained for the foreground score. Each pixel is then assigned a (soft) label based on the ratio of the background and foreground scores. The variance used in the estimation kernel reflects the spatial and appearance uncertainties in the scene. On applying our method to a data set with wide variations across the videos, we found that choosing suitable kernel variances during the estimation process is very important. With various experiments, we establish that the best kernel variance could vary for different videos and more importantly, even within a single video, different regions in the image should be treated with different variance values. For example, in a scene with a steady tree trunk and leaves that are waving in the wind, the trunk region can be explained with a small amount of spatial variance. The leaf regions may be better explained by a process with a large variance. Interestingly, when there is no wind, the leaf regions may also be explained with a low variance. The optimal variance hence changes for . each region in the video and also across time. This phenomenon is captured reasonably in MoG by use of different parameters for each pixel which adapt dynamically to the scene statistics, but the pixel-wise model does not allow a pixel’s neighbors to affect its distribution. address the phenomenon by updating the model with data samples from the most recent frame. We show that using location- specific variances in addition to updating the model greatly improves background modeling. Our approach with pixel-wise variances, which we call the variable kernel score (VKS) method results in significant improvement over uniform variance models and state of the art backgrounding systems. The idea of using a pixel-wise variance for background modeling is not new. Although use a uniform variance, they discuss the use of variances that change as a function of the data samples or as a function of the point at which the estimation is made. Variance selection for KDE is a well studied problem with common solutions including mean integrated square error (MISE), asymptotic MISE (AMISE), and the leave-one-out-estimator based solutions. In the background subtraction context, there has been work on using a different covariance at each pixel. While require that the uncertainties in the feature values can be calculated in closed form, learn the covariances for each pixel from a training set of frames and keep the learned covariances fixed for the entire classification phase. We use a maximum-likelihood approach to select the best variance at each pixel location. For every frame of the video, at each pixel location, the best variance is picked from a set of variance values by maximizing the likelihood of the pixel’s observation under different variances. This makes our method a balloon estimator. By explicitly selecting the best variance from a range of variance values, we do not require the covariances to be calculable in closed-form and also allow for more flexibility at the classification stage. Selecting the best of many kernel variances for each pixel means increased computation. One possible trade-off between accuracy and speed can be achieved by a caching scheme where the best kernel variances from the previous frame are used to calculate the scores for the current frame pixels. If the resulting classification is overwhelmingly in favor of either label, there is no need to perform a search for the best kernel variance for that pixel. The expensive variance selection procedure can be applied only to pixels where there is some contention between the two labels. We present a heuristic that achieves significant reduction in computation compared to our full implementation while maintaining the benefits of adaptive variance. Development and improvement of the probabilistic models is one of the two main themes in back- ground modeling research in recent years. The other theme is the development of complex features like local binary and ternary patterns that are more robust than color features for the task of back- ground modeling. Scale-invariant local ternary patterns (SILTP) are recently developed features that have been shown to be very robust to lighting changes and shadows in the scene. By combining color features with SILTP features in our adaptive variance kernel model, we bring together the best ideas from both themes in the field and achieve state of the art results on a benchmark data set. The main contributions of this paper are: 1. A practical scheme for pixel-wise variance selection for background modeling. 2. A heuristic for selectively updating variances to improve speed further. 3. Incorporation of complex SILTP features into the joint domain-range kernel framework to achieve state of the art results. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses our background and foreground models. Dynamic adaptation of kernel variances is discussed in Section 3. Results and comparisons are in Section 4. An efficient algorithm is discussed in Section 5. We end with a discussion in Section 6. 2 Background and foreground models In a video captured by a static camera, the pixel values are influenced by the background phenomenon, and new or existing foreground objects. We refer to any phenomenon that can affect image pixel values as a process. Like , we model the background and foreground processes using data samples from previous frames. The scores for the background and foreground processes at each pixel location are calculated using contributions from the data samples in each model. One major difference between and our model is that we allow “soft labeling”, i.e. the data samples contribute probabilistically to the background score depending on the samples’ probability of belonging to the background. 2 Let a pixel sample a = [ax, ay, ar, ag, ab], where (ax, ay) are the location of the pixel and (ar, ag, ab) are the red, green, and blue values of the pixel. In each frame of the video, we compute background and foreground scores using pixel samples from the previous frames. The background model consists of the samples B = bi : i [1 : nB] and foreground samples are F = fi : i [1 : nF ], with nB and nF being the number of background and foreground samples respectively, and bi and fi being pixel samples obtained from previous frames in the video. Under a KDE model, the likelihood of the sample under the background model is P(a|bg; σ) = 1 nB nB X i=1 G(a −bi; σB) (1) where G(x; ) is a multivariate Gaussian with zero mean and covariance B. G(x; σ) = (2π)−D 2 |σ|−1 2 exp(−1 2xT σ−1x), (2) where D is the dimensionality of the vector x. In our model, we approximate the background score at sample a as SB(a; σd B, σrgb B ) = 1 NB NB X i=1 G(argb −birgb; σrgb B ) × G(axy −bixy; σd B) × P(bg|bi) (3) NB is the number of frames from which the background samples have been collected, B d and B rgb are two and three dimensional background covariance matrices in spatial and color dimensions respectively. A large spatial covariance allows neighboring pixels to contribute more to the score at a given pixel location. Color covariance allows for some color appearance changes at a given pixel location. Use of NB in the denominator compensates for the different lengths of the background and foreground models. The above equation basically sums the contribution from each background sample based on its distance in color space, weighted by its distance in spatial dimensions and the probability of the sample belonging to the background. The use of P (bg|bi) in Equation 3 and normalization by the number of frames as opposed to the number of samples means that the score does not sum to 1 over all possible values of a. Thus, the score, although similar to the likelihood in Equation 1, is not a probability distribution. A similar equation holds for the foreground score: SF (a; σd F , σrgb F ) = 1 NF NF X i=1 G(argb −firgb; σrgb F ) × G(axy −fixy; σd F ) × P(fg|fi) (4) NF is the number of frames from which the foreground samples have been collected, F d and F rgb are the covariances associated with the foreground process. However, for the foreground process, to account for emergence of new colors in the scene, we mix in a constant contribution independent of the estimation point’s and data samples’ color values. We assume that each data sample in a pixel’s spatial neighborhood contributes a constant value u to the foreground score. The constant contribution UF (a) is given by UF (a; σd F ) = NF X i=1 u × G(axy −fixy; σd F ) (5) We get a modified foreground score by including the constant contribution: ˆSF (a; σd F , σrgb F ) = αF × UF (a; σd F ) + (1 −αF ) × SF (a; σd F , σrgb F ). (6) F is a parameter that represents the amount of mixing between the constant contribution and the color dependent foreground score. u is set to 106 and is set to 0.5 for our experiments. To classify a particular sample as background or foreground, we can use a Bayes-like formula: P(bg|a) = SB(a; σd B, σrgb B ) SB(a; σd B, σrgb B ) + ˆSF (a; σd F , σrgb F ) (7) 3 P(fg|a) = 1 −P(bg|a). (8) Adding the constant factor U to the foreground score (and hence to the denominator of the Bayes-like equation) has the interesting property that when either one of the foreground or background scores is significantly larger than U , U has little effect on the classification. However, if both the background and foreground scores are less than U , then Equation 7 will return a low value as P (bg|a). Hence, an observation that has very low background and foreground scores will be classified as foreground. This is desirable because if a pixel observation is not well explained by either model, it is natural to assume that the pixel is a result of a new object in the scene and is hence foreground. In terms of likelihoods, adding the constant factor to the foreground likelihood is akin to mixing it with a uniform distribution. 2.1 Model initialization and update To initialize the models, it is assumed that the first few frames (typically 50) are all background pixels. The background model is populated using pixel samples from these frames. In order to improve efficiency, we sample 5 frames at equal time intervals from these 50 frames. The foreground model is initialized to have no samples. The modified foreground score (Equation 6) enables colors that are not well explained by the background model to be classified as foreground, thus bootstrapping the foreground model. Once the pixel at location (ax, ay) from a new frame is classified using Equation 7, the background and foreground models at the location (ax, ay) can then be updated with the new sample a. Background and foreground samples at location (ax, ay) from the oldest frame in the models are replaced by a. Samples from the previous 5 frames are maintained in memory as the foreground model samples. The label probabilities of the background/foreground from Equation 7 are also saved along with the sample values for subsequent use in the Equations 3 and 4. One consequence of the update procedure described above is that when a large foreground object occludes a background pixel at (ax, ay) for more than 50 frames, all the background samples in the spatial neighborhood of (ax, ay) are replaced by these foreground samples that have very low P (bg|bi) values. This causes the pixel at (ax, ay) to be misclassified as foreground even when the occluding foreground object has moved away (because the background score will be extremely low due to the influence of P (bg|bi) in Equation 3). To avoid this problem, we replace the background sample from location (ax, ay) in the oldest frame in the background model with the new sample a from the current frame only if P (bg|a) estimated from Equation 7 is greater than 0.5. In our chosen evaluation data set, there are several videos with moving objects in the first 50 frames. The assumption that all these pixels are background is not severely limiting even in these videos. The model update procedure allows us to recover from any errors that are caused by the presence of foreground objects in the initialization frames. 2.2 Using MRF to clean the classification Similar to , we use a Markov random field (MRF) defined over the posterior label probabilities of the 4-neighbors of each pixel and perform the min-cut procedure to post-process the labels. The interaction factor between the nodes was set to 1 for all our experiments. 3 Pixel-wise adaptive kernel variance selection Background and foreground kernels. use the same kernel parameters for background and foreground models. Given the different nature of the two processes, it is reasonable to use different kernel parameters. For instance, foreground objects typically move between 5 and 10 pixels per frame in the data set, whereas background pixels are either stationary or move very little. Hence, it is useful to have a larger spatial variance for the foreground model than for the background model. Optimal kernel variance for all videos. In the results section, we show that for a data set with large variations like , a single value for kernel variance for all videos is not sufficient to capture the variability in all the videos. Variable kernel variance for a single video. As explained in the introduction, different parts of the scene may have different statistics and hence need different kernel variance values. For example, in Figure 1a to 1d, having a high spatial dimension kernel variance helps in accurate classification of 4 the water surface pixels, but doing so causes some pixels on the person’s leg to become part of the background. Ideally, we would have different kernel variances for the water surface pixels and the rest of the pixels. Similarly in the second video (Figure 1e to 1h), having a high kernel variance allows accurate classification of some of the fountain pixels as background at the cost of misclassifying many foreground pixels. The figure also shows that while the medium kernel variance may be the best choice for the first video, the low kernel variance may be best for the second video. Optimal kernel variance for classification. Having different variances for the background and foreground models reflects the differences between the expected uncertainty in the two processes. However, having different variances for the two processes could cause erroneous classification of pixels. Figure 2 shows a 1-dimensional example where using a very wide kernel (high variance) or very narrow kernel for the background process causes misclassification. Assuming that the red point (square) is a background sample and the blue point (triangle) is a foreground sample, having a very low variance kernel (dashed red line) or a very high variance (solid red line) for the background process makes the background likelihood of the center point ‘x’ lower than the foreground likelihood. Thus, it is important to pick the optimal kernel variance for each process during classification. In order to address all four issues discussed above, we propose the use of location-specific variances. For each location in the image, a range of kernel variances is tried and the variance which results in the highest score is chosen for the background and the foreground models separately. The background score with location-dependent variances is SB(a; σBd,x,y, σBrgb,x,y) = 1 NB NB X i=1 G(argb −birgb; σBrgb,x,y) × G(axy −bixy; σBd,x,y) × P(bg|bi) (9) where B d,x,y and B rgb,x,y represent the location-specific spatial and color dimension variances at location (x, y). For each pixel location (ax, ay), the optimal variance for the background process is selected by maximizing the score of the background label at sample a under different variance values: {σ∗ Bd,ax,ay, σ∗ Brgb,ax,ay} = argmaxσBd,ax,ay ,σBrgb,ax,ay SB(a; σBd,ax,ay, σBrgb,ax,ay). (10) Here, B RB d and B rgb. RB d and RB rgb,ax,ay d,ax,ay rgb represent the set of spatial and color dimension variances from which to choose the optimal variance. A similar procedure may be followed for the foreground score. However, in practice, it was found that the variance selection procedure yielded large improvements when applied to the background model and little improvement in the foreground model. Hence, our final implementation uses an adaptive kernel variance procedure for the background model and a fixed kernel variance for the foreground model. 4 Results For comparisons, we use the data set which consists of 9 videos taken using a static camera in various environments. The data set offers various challenges including dynamic background like trees and waves, gradual and sudden illumination changes, and the presence of multiple moving objects. Ground truth for 20 frames in each video is provided with the data set. The F-measure is used to measure accuracy. The effect of choosing various kernel widths for the background and foreground models is shown in Table 1. The table shows the F-measure for each of the videos in the data set for various choices of the kernel variances. The first 5 columns correspond to using a constant variance for each process at all pixel locations in the video. Having identical kernel variances for the background and foreground models (columns 1, 2) is not as effective as having different variances (all other columns). Comparing columns 2 and 3 shows that using a larger spatial variance for the foreground model than for the background model is beneficial. Changing the spatial variance from 3 (column 3) to 1 (column 4) helps the overall accuracy in one video (Fountain). Using a selection procedure where the best kernel variance is chosen from a set of values gives the best results for most videos (column 6) and frames. Comparison of our selection procedure to a baseline method of using a standard algorithm for variance selection in KDE (AMISE criterion) shows that the standard algorithm is not as accurate as our 5 method (column 7). Our choice for the variance values for spatial dimension reflects no motion (B d = 1/4) and very little motion (B d = 3/4) for the background, and moderate amount of motion (F d = 12/4) for the foreground. For the color dimension, the choice is between little variation (B rgb= 5/4), moderate variation (B rgb= 15/4), and high variation (B rgb= 45/4) for the background, and moderate variation (F rgb= 15/4) for the foreground. These choices are based on our intuition about the processes involved. For videos that differ significantly from the videos we use, it is possible that the baseline AMISE method would perform better. We would like to point out that ideally the variance value sets should be learned automatically from a separate training data set. In absence of suitable training data for these videos in particular and for background subtraction research in general, we resort to manually choosing these values. This also appears to be the common practice among researchers in this area. Benchmark comparisons are provided for selected existing methods - MOG, the complex foreground model (ACMMM03), and SILTP. To evaluate our results, the posterior probability of the background label is thresholded at a value of 0.5 to get the foreground pixels. Following the same procedure as , any foreground 4-connected components smaller than a size threshold of 15 pixels are ignored. Figure 3 shows qualitative results for the same frames that were reported by . We present results for our kernel method with uniform variances and adaptive variances with RGB features (Uniform-rgb and VKS-rgb respectively), and adaptive variances with a hybrid feature space of LAB color and SILTP features (VKS-lab+siltp). Except for the Lobby video, the VKS results are better than other methods. The Lobby video is an instance where there is a sudden change in illumination in the scene (turning a light switch on and off). Due to use of an explicit foreground model, our kernel methods misclassify most of the pixels as foreground and take a long time to recover from this error. A possible solution for this case is presented later. Compared to the uniform variance kernel estimates, we see that VKS-rgb has fewer false positive foreground pixels. Quantitative results in Table 3 compare the F-measure scores for our method against MoG, ACMMM03, and SILTP results as reported by . The table shows that methods that share spa- tial information (uniform kernel and VKS) with RGB features give significantly better results than methods that use RGB features without spatial sharing. Comparing the variable kernel method to a uniform kernel method in the same feature space (RGB), we see a significant improvement in performance for most videos. Scale-invariant local ternary pattern (SILTP) is a recent texture feature that is robust to soft shadows and lighting changes. We believe SILTP represents the state of the art in background modeling and hence compare our results to this method. Scale-invariant local states is a slight variation in the representation of the SILTP feature. For comparison, we use SILTP results from because in human judgement was used to vary a size threshold parameter for each video. We believe results from the latter fall under a different category of human-assisted backgrounding and hence do not compare to our method where no video-specific hand-tuning of parameters was done. Table 3 shows that SILTP is very robust to lighting changes and works well across the entire data set. Blue entries in Table 3 correspond to videos where our method performs better than SILTP. VKS with RGB features (VKS-rgb) performs well in videos that have few shadows and lighting changes. Use of color features that are more robust to illumination change, like LAB features in place of RGB helps in successful classification of the shadow regions as background. Texture features are robust to lighting changes but not effective on large texture-less objects. Color features are effective on large objects, but not very robust to varying illumination. By combining texture features with LAB color features, we expect to benefit from the strengths of both feature spaces. Such a combination has proved useful in earlier work. Augmenting the LAB features with SILTP features (computed at 3 resolutions) in the VKS framework (VKS-lab+siltp) results in an improvement in 7 out of 9 videos (last column). The variance values used in our implementation are given in Table 2. We also compare our results (VKS-lab+siltp) to the 5 videos that were submitted as supplementary material by . Figure 4 highlights some key frames that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of our system versus the SILTP results. The common problems with our algorithm are shadows being classified as foreground (row e) and initialization errors (row e shows a scene where the desk was occluded by people when the background model was initialized. Due to the explicit foreground model, VKS takes some time to recover from the erroneous initialization). A common drawback with SILTP is that large texture-less objects have “holes” in them (row a). Use of color features helps avoid these errors. The SILTP system also loses objects that stop moving (rows b, c, d, f). Due to the explicit modeling of the foreground, VKS is able to detect objects that stop moving. 6 The two videos in the data set where our algorithm performs worse than SILTP are the Escalator video (rows g, h) and the Lobby video (rows i, j). In the Escalator video, our algorithm fails at the escalator steps due to large variation in color in the region. In the Lobby video, at the time of sudden illumination change, many pixels in the image get classified as foreground. Due to the foreground model, these pixels continue to be misclassified for a long duration (row j). The problem is more serious for RGB features (Figure 3 column 2). One method to address the situation is to observe the illumination change from one frame to the next. If more than half the pixels in the image change in illumination by a threshold value of TI or more, we throw away all the background samples at that instance and begin learning a new model from the subsequent 50 frames. This method allows us to address the poor performance in the Lobby video with resulting F-measure values of 86.77 for uniform-rgb, 78.46 for VKS-rgb, and 77.76 for VKS-lab+siltp. TI of 10 and 2.5 were used for RGB and LAB spaces respectively. The illumination change procedure does not affect the performance of VKS on any other video in the data set. 5 Caching optimal kernel variances from previous frame A major drawback with trying multiple variance values at each pixel to select the best variance is that the amount of computation per pixel increases significantly. In order to reduce the complexity the algorithm, we use a scheme where the current frame’s optimal variance values for each pixel location for both the background and foreground processes is stored (Bcache x,y , Fcache x,y ) for each location (x, y) in the image. When classifying pixels in the next frame, these cached variance values are first tried. If the resulting scores are very far apart, then it is very likely that the pixel has not changed its label from the previous frame. The expensive variance selection procedure is performed only at pixels where the resulting scores are close to each other. Algorithm 1 for efficient computation results in a reduction in computation in about 80 6 Discussion By applying kernel estimate method to a large data set, we have established, as do , that the use of spatial information is extremely helpful. Some of the important issues pertaining to the choice of kernel parameters for data sets with wide variations have been addressed. Having a uniform kernel variance for the entire data set and for all pixels in the image results in a poor overall system. Dynamically adapting the variance for each pixel results in a significant increase in accuracy. Using color features in the joint domain-range kernel estimation approach can complement complex background model features in settings where the latter are known to be inaccurate. Combining robust color features like LAB with texture features like SILTP in a VKS framework yields a highly accurate background classification system. For future work, we believe our method could be explained more elegantly in a probabilistic frame- work where the scores are replaced by likelihoods and informative priors are used in the Bayes rule classification. 7 Column num (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) 4*B d → 3 3 3 1 3 [1 3] AMISE 4*B rgb→ 15 45 45 45 15 [5 15 45] AMISE 4*F d → 3 3 12 12 12 [12] [12] 4*F rgb→ 15 45 45 45 15 [15] [15] AirportHall 40.72 59.53 67.07 63.53 47.21 70.44 53.01 Bootstrap 49.01 57.90 63.04 58.39 51.49 71.25 63.38 Curtain 66.26 83.33 91.91 89.52 81.54 94.11 52.00 Escalator 20.92 30.24 34.69 28.58 22.65 48.61 32.02 Fountain 41.87 51.89 73.24 74.58 67.60 75.84 28.50 ShoppingMall 55.19 60.17 64.95 62.18 63.85 76.48 70.14 Lobby 22.18 23.81 25.79 25.69 25.06 18.00 36.77 Trees 30.14 58.41 73.53 47.03 67.80 82.09 64.30 WaterSurface 85.82 94.04 94.93 92.91 94.64 94.83 30.29 Average 45.79 57.70 65.46 60.27 52.98 70.18 47.82 Table 1: F-measure for different kernel variances.

P061.pdf,"Enhancing Visual Representation Learning Through Original Image Utilization in Contrastive Learning Abstract Contrastive instance discrimination techniques exhibit superior performance in downstream tasks, including image classification and object detection, compared to supervised learning. However, a strong reliance on data augmentation during repre- sentation learning is a hallmark of these methods, potentially causing suboptimal outcomes if not meticulously executed. A prevalent data augmentation approach in contrastive learning involves random cropping followed by resizing. This practice might diminish the quality of representation learning when two random crops encompass disparate semantic information. To counter this, we propose an inno- vative framework termed LeOCLR (Leveraging Original Images for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations). This framework integrates a novel instance discrimination strategy and a refined loss function, effectively mitigating the loss of crucial semantic features that may arise from mapping different object segments during representation learning. Our empirical evaluations reveal that LeOCLR con- sistently enhances representation learning across a spectrum of datasets, surpassing baseline models. Notably, LeOCLR exhibits a 5.1% improvement over MoCo-v2 on ImageNet-1K in linear evaluation and demonstrates superior performance in transfer learning and object detection tasks compared to several other techniques. 1 Introduction Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods based on instance discrimination are heavily dependent on data augmentations, like random cropping, rotation, and color jitter, to construct invariant repre- sentations for all instances within a dataset. These augmentations are used to generate two altered views (positive pairs) of the same instance, which are subsequently drawn closer in the latent space. Simultaneously, strategies are employed to prevent a collapse to a trivial solution, commonly referred to as representation collapse. The efficacy of these methods in acquiring meaningful representations has been demonstrated through various downstream tasks, such as image classification and object detection, serving as proxies for evaluating representation learning. However, these techniques often overlook the crucial aspect that augmented views may diverge in semantic content because of random cropping, potentially degrading the quality of visual representation learning. Creating positive pairs via random cropping and subsequently prompting the model to align them based on shared information in both views poses an increased challenge to the SSL task, ultimately leading to an enhancement in representation quality. Moreover, random cropping followed by resizing guides the model’s representation to encompass object-related information across diverse aspect ratios, thereby promoting invariance to occlusions. Conversely, minimizing the feature distance in the latent space, which equates to maximizing similarity, between views that encompass distinct semantic concepts may inadvertently discard valuable image information. Instances of incorrect semantic positive pairs, which are pairs containing mismatched semantic information about the same object, might arise from random cropping. When the model is compelled to align the representations of different parts of an object closer in the latent space, it may discard crucial semantic features. This occurs because the model’s representations are based on the shared area between the two views. If this shared region lacks semantically consistent information, the . representations become trivial. For random cropping to be effective and achieve occlusion invariance, the shared area must convey the same semantic meaning in both views. Nevertheless, contrasting pairs that might include diverse semantic information about the same object can be valuable, as it can facilitate learning global features. The creation of random crops for a one-centric object does not ensure the acquisition of accurate semantic pairs. This observation holds significant importance for the enhancement of representation learning. Instance discrimination SSL techniques encourage the model to approximate positive pairs, i.e., two views of the same instance, in the latent space, irrespective of their semantic content. This limitation might hinder the model’s ability to learn representations of different object components and could potentially impair its capability to learn semantic feature representations (see Figure 2 (left) in the original paper). Undesirable views containing different semantic content may be unavoidable when employing random cropping. Therefore, a method is needed to train the model on different parts of an object, developing robust representations against natural transformations like scale and occlusion, rather than merely pulling augmented views together indiscriminately. Addressing this issue is vital, as downstream task performance relies on high-quality visual representations learned through self-supervised learning. Our work presents a new instance discrimination SSL approach designed to avoid compelling the model to create similar representations for two positive views, irrespective of their semantic content. As shown in Figure 2 (right) of the original paper, we incorporate the original image X into the training process, since it contains all the semantic features of the views X1 and X2. In our method, the positive pairs (i.e., X1 and X2) are drawn towards the original image X in the latent space, in contrast to contrastive state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches like SimCLR and MoCo-v2, which draw the two views towards each other. This training method guarantees that the information in the shared region between the attracted views (X, X1) and (X, X2) is semantically accurate. Consequently, the model acquires enhanced semantic features by aligning with the appropriate semantic content, rather than matching random views that might contain disparate semantic information. In essence, the model learns representations of various object parts because the shared region encompasses correct semantic components of the object. This contrasts with other methods that may discard vital semantic features by incorrectly mapping object parts in positive pairs. Our contributions are outlined as follows: • We present a new contrastive instance discrimination SSL method, LeOCLR, created to minimize the loss of semantic features caused by mapping two semantically inconsistent random views. • We establish that our method enhances visual representation learning in contrastive instance discrimination SSL, surpassing state-of-the-art techniques across a variety of downstream tasks. • We show that our method consistently improves visual representation learning for contrastive instance discrimination across multiple datasets and contrastive mechanisms. 2 Related Work Self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques are categorized into two primary groups: contrastive and non-contrastive learning. While all these techniques endeavor to approximate positive pairs in the latent space, they employ distinct strategies to circumvent representation collapse. **Contrastive Learning:** Instance discrimination techniques, such as SimCLR, MoCo, and PIRL, employ a similar concept. These methods bring the positive pairs closer while driving the negative pairs apart in the embedding space, albeit through different mechanisms. SimCLR employs an end-to-end strategy where a large batch size is utilized for negative examples, and the parameters of both encoders in the Siamese network are updated simultaneously. PIRL uses a memory bank for negative examples, and both encoders’ parameters are updated together. MoCo adopts a momentum contrastive approach where the query encoder is updated during backpropagation, which subsequently updates the key encoder. Negative examples are maintained in a separate dictionary, facilitating the use of large batch sizes. **Non-Contrastive Learning:** Non-contrastive techniques utilize solely positive pairs to learn visual representations, employing a variety of strategies to prevent representation collapse. The 2 initial category encompasses clustering-based techniques, where samples exhibiting similar features are assigned to the same cluster. DeepCluster employs pseudo-labels from the previous iteration, rendering it computationally demanding and challenging to scale. SWAV addresses this challenge by implementing online clustering, though it necessitates determining the correct number of prototypes. The second category involves knowledge distillation. Techniques like BYOL and SimSiam utilize knowledge distillation methods, where a Siamese network comprises an online encoder and a target encoder. The target network’s parameters are not updated during backpropagation. Instead, solely the online network’s parameters are updated while being encouraged to predict the representation of the target network. Despite the encouraging results, the mechanism by which these methods prevent collapse remains not fully understood. Inspired by BYOL, Self-distillation with no labels (DINO) employs centering and sharpening, along with a distinct backbone (ViT), enabling it to surpass other self-supervised techniques while maintaining computational efficiency. Another method, Bag of visual words (BoW), employs a teacher-student framework inspired by natural language processing (NLP) to avert representation collapse. The student network predicts a histogram of the features for augmented images, analogous to the teacher network’s histogram. The final category is information maximization. Methods like Barlow twins and VICReg eschew negative examples, stop gradient, or clustering. Instead, they utilize regularization to avoid representation collapse. The objective function of these techniques seeks to eliminate redundant information in the embeddings by aligning the correlation of the embedding vectors closer to the identity matrix. While these techniques exhibit encouraging results, they possess limitations, including the sensitivity of representation learning to regularization and reduced effectiveness if certain statistical properties are absent in the data. **Instance Discrimination With Multi-Crops:** Various SSL techniques introduce multi-crop strate- gies to enable models to learn visual representations of objects from diverse perspectives. However, when generating multiple cropped views from the same object instance, these views might contain disparate semantic information. To tackle this issue, LoGo generates two random global crops and N local views. They posit that global and local views of an object share similar semantic content, enhancing similarity between these views. Simultaneously, they contend that different local views possess distinct semantic content, thus diminishing similarity among them. SCFS proposes a different approach for managing unmatched semantic views by searching for semantically consistent features between the contrasted views. CLSA generates multiple crops and applies both strong and weak augmentations, using distance divergence loss to enhance instance discrimination in representation learning. Prior methods assume that global views contain similar semantic content and treat them indiscriminately as positive pairs. However, our technique suggests that global views might contain incorrect semantic pairs due to random cropping, as illustrated in Figure 1 in the original paper. Therefore, we aim to attract the two global views to the original (intact and uncropped) image, which fully encapsulates the semantic features of the crops. 3 Methodology The mapping of incorrect semantic positive pairs, specifically those containing different semantic views, results in the loss of semantic features, which in turn degrades the model’s representation learning. To address this, we propose a novel contrastive instance discrimination SSL strategy called LeOCLR. Our approach is designed to capture meaningful features from two random positive pairs, even when they encompass different semantic content, thereby improving representation learning. Achieving this necessitates ensuring the semantic correctness of the information within the shared region between the attracted views. This is crucial because the selection of views dictates the information captured by the representations learned in contrastive learning. Given that we cannot guarantee the inclusion of correct semantic parts of the object within the shared region between the two views, we propose the inclusion of the original image in the training process. The original image X, which is not subjected to random cropping, encompasses all the semantic features of the two cropped views, X1 and X2. Our method, illustrated in Figure 3 (left) in the original paper, generates three views (X, X1, and X2). The original image (X) is resized without cropping, while the other views (X1 and X2) undergo random cropping and resizing. All views are then randomly augmented to prevent the model from learning trivial features. We employ data augmentations akin to those used in MoCo-v2. The original image (X) is encoded by the encoder fq, while the two views (X1, X2) are encoded by a momentum encoder fk. The parameters of fk are updated using the formula: 3 θk ←mθk + (1 −m)θq (1) where m is a coefficient set to 0.999, θq represents the encoder parameters of fq updated through backpropagation, and θk denotes the momentum encoder parameters of fk updated by θq. Ultimately, the objective function compels the model to draw both views (X1, X2) closer to the original image (X) in the embedding space while simultaneously pushing apart all other instances, as depicted in Figure 3 (right) in the original paper. 3.1 Loss function Initially, we briefly outline the loss function of MoCo-v2, given our utilization of momentum contrastive learning. Subsequently, we will detail our modification to the loss function. ℓ(u, v+) = −log exp(u·v+/τ) PP N n=0 exp(u·vn/τ) (2) where similarity is quantified by the dot product. The objective function amplifies the similarity between the positive pairs (u . v+) by drawing them closer in the embedding space, while simultane- ously driving apart all the negative samples (vn) in the dictionary to prevent representation collapse. τ denotes the temperature hyperparameter of the softmax function. In our method, we augment the similarity between the original image’s feature representation, u = fq(x), and the positive pair’s feature representation, v+ = fk(xi) (i = 1, 2), while driving apart all the negative examples (vn). Consequently, the total loss for the mini-batch is: lt = PN i=1 ℓ(ui, sg(v1 i )) + ℓ(ui, sg(v2 i )) (3) where sg(.) denotes the stop-gradient operation, which is vital for averting representation collapse. As depicted in Equation 3, the total loss lt attracts the two views (v1 i and v2 i ) to their original instance ui. This enables the model to capture semantic features from the two random views, even if they contain different semantic information. Our technique captures improved semantic features compared to prior contrastive methods, as we ensure that the shared region between the attracted views contains accurate semantic information. Since the original image contains all segments of the object, any part contained in the random crop is also present in the original image. Thus, when we draw the original image and the two random views closer in the embedding space, the model learns representations of the different parts, creating an occlusion-invariant representation of the object across various scales and angles. This contrasts with earlier techniques, which draw the two views together in the embedding space regardless of their semantic content, leading to the loss of semantic features. Equation 3 and Algorithm 1 in the original paper highlight the primary distinctions between our method and prior multi-crop techniques, such as CLSA, SCFC, and DINO. The key differences are as follows: • Previous methods assume that two global views contain identical semantic information, encouraging the model to concentrate on similarities and generate similar representations for both views. In contrast, our method utilizes the original images instead of global views, as we contend that global views may contain incorrect semantic information for the same object. While they may aid in capturing certain global features, this could restrict the model’s capacity to learn more universally applicable semantic features, ultimately impacting performance. • Prior methods employ several local random crops, which might be time- and memory- intensive, while our method utilizes only two random crops. • Our objective function employs different strategies to enhance the model’s visual represen- tation learning. We encourage the model to align the two random crops with the original image, which encompasses the semantic information for all random crops while avoiding compelling the two crops to have similar representations if they do not share similar semantic information. This approach differs from prior methods, which encourage all crops (global and local) to have similar representations, regardless of their semantic content. Conse- quently, although useful for learning certain global features, those methods may discard pertinent semantic information, potentially hindering the transferability of the resulting representations to downstream tasks. 4 4 Experiments We executed multiple experiments on three datasets: STL-10 ""unlabeled"", comprising 100,000 training images, CIFAR-10, containing 50,000 training images, and ImageNet-1K, with 1.28 million training images. **Training Setup:** We employed ResNet50 as the backbone architecture. The model was trained using the SGD optimizer, with a weight decay set to 0.0001, momentum at 0.9, and an initial learning rate of 0.03. The mini-batch size was configured to 256, and the model underwent training for up to 800 epochs on the ImageNet-1K dataset. **Evaluation:** We employed diverse downstream tasks to assess LeOCLR’s representation learning against leading SOTA approaches on ImageNet-1K: linear evaluation, semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and object detection. For linear evaluation, we adhered to the standard evaluation protocol, where a linear classifier was trained for 100 epochs on top of a frozen backbone pre-trained with LeOCLR. The ImageNet-1K training set was used to train the linear classifier from scratch, with random cropping and left-to-right flipping augmentations. Results are presented on the ImageNet- 1K validation set using a center crop (224 x 224). In the semi-supervised setting, we fine-tuned the network for 60 epochs using 1% of labeled data and 30 epochs using 10% of labeled data. Additionally, we evaluated the learned features on smaller datasets, such as CIFAR, and fine-grained datasets, using transfer learning. Lastly, we utilized the PASCAL VOC dataset for object detection. **Comparing with SOTA Approaches:** We employed vanilla MoCo-v2 as a baseline for comparison with our method across various benchmark datasets, considering our use of a momentum contrastive learning framework. Furthermore, we benchmarked our method against other SOTA techniques on the ImageNet-1K dataset. Table 1: Comparisons between our approach LeOCLR and SOTA approaches on ImageNet-1K.

As shown, our method surpasses all others, outperforming the baseline (i.e., vanilla MoCo-v2) by 5.1%. This lends credence to our hypothesis that while two global views can capture certain global features, they may also encompass distinct semantic information for the same object (e.g., a dog’s head versus its leg), which should be taken into account to enhance representation learning. The observed performance gap (i.e., the difference between vanilla MoCo-v2 and LeOCLR) demonstrates that mapping pairs with divergent semantic content impedes representation learning and impacts the model’s performance in downstream tasks. **Semi-Supervised Learning on ImageNet-1K:** In this section, we assess the performance of LeOCLR under a semi-supervised setting. Specifically, we utilize 1% and 10% of the labeled training 5 data from ImageNet-1K for fine-tuning, adhering to the semi-supervised protocol introduced in SimCLR. The top-1 accuracy, presented in Table 2 after fine-tuning with 1% and 10% of the training data, demonstrates LeOCLR’s superiority over all compared techniques. This can be attributed to LeOCLR’s enhanced representation learning capabilities, particularly in comparison to other SOTA methods.

We adhere to the transfer learning procedures to identify optimal hyperparameters for each downstream task. As shown in Table 3, our method, LeOCLR, surpasses all compared approaches on a variety of downstream tasks. This demonstrates that our model acquires valuable semantic features, enabling it to generalize more effectively to unseen data in different downstream tasks compared to other techniques. Our method preserves the semantic features of the given objects, thereby enhancing the model’s representation learning capabilities. Consequently, it is more effective at extracting crucial features and predicting correct classes on transferred tasks.

We follow the same settings as MoCo-v2, fine-tuning on the VOC07+12 trainval dataset using Faster R-CNN with an R50-C4 backbone, and evaluating on the VOC07 test dataset. The model is fine- tuned for 24k iterations (˘2248 23 epochs). As shown in Table 4, our method surpasses all compared techniques. This superior performance can be attributed to our model’s ability to capture richer semantic features compared to the baseline (MoCo-v2) and other techniques, leading to improved results in object detection and related tasks. 5 Ablation Studies In the subsequent subsections, we further analyze our approach using a different contrastive instance discrimination technique (i.e., an end-to-end mechanism) to investigate how our method performs within this framework. Moreover, we conduct studies on the benchmark datasets STL-10 and CIFAR-10 using a distinct backbone (ResNet-18) to assess the consistency of our approach across various datasets and backbones. Additionally, we employ a random crop test to simulate natural 6 Table 4: Results (Average Precision) for PASCAL VOC object detection using Faster R-CNN with ResNet-50-C4.

We also compare our approach with vanilla MoCo-v2 by manipulating their data augmentation techniques to determine which model’s performance is more significantly affected by the removal of certain augmentations. In addition, we experiment with different fine-tuning settings to evaluate which model learns better and faster. Furthermore, we adapt the attraction strategy and cropping method of the original image, as well as compute the running time of our approach. Lastly, we examine our approach on a non-centric object dataset where the probability of mapping two views containing distinct information is higher. 5.1 Different Contrastive Instance Discrimination Framework We utilize an end-to-end framework in which the two encoders fq and fk are updated through backpropagation to train a model with our approach for 200 epochs with a batch size of 256. Subsequently, we conduct a linear evaluation of our model against SimCLR, which also employs an end-to-end mechanism. As presented in Table 5, our approach outperforms vanilla SimCLR by a substantial margin of 3.5%, demonstrating its suitability for integration with various contrastive learning frameworks. Table 5: Comparing vanilla SimCLR with LeOCLR after training our approach 200 epochs on ImageNet-1K. Approach ImageNet-1K SimCLR 62% LeOCLR (ours) 65.5% 5.2 Scalability In Table 6, we evaluate our approach on different datasets (STL-10 and CIFAR-10) using a ResNet-18 backbone to ensure its consistency across various backbones and datasets (i.e., scalability). We pre-trained all the approaches for 800 epochs with a batch size of 256 on both datasets and then conducted a linear evaluation. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on both datasets compared to all approaches. For instance, our approach outperforms vanilla MoCo-v2, achieving accuracies of 5.12% and 5.71% on STL-10 and CIFAR-10, respectively. Table 6: SOTA approaches versus LeOCLR on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 with ResNet-18.

According to the results, the performance of MoCo-v2 dropped by 4.3% with random cropping, whereas our approach experienced a smaller drop of 2.8%. This suggests that our approach learns improved semantic features, demonstrating greater invariance to natural transformations like occlusion and variations in object scales. Additionally, we compare the performance of CLSA with our approach, given that both perform similarly after 800 epochs (see Table 1). Note that the CLSA approach uses multi-crop (i.e., five strong and two weak augmentations), while our approach employs only two random crops and the original image. As shown in Table 7, LeOCLR outperforms the CLSA approach by 2.3% after 200 epochs on ImageNet-1K. To address concerns about the increased computational cost associated with training LeOCLR compared to MoCo V2, we include the training time for both approaches in Table 7. We trained both models on three A100 GPUs with 80GB for 200 epochs. Our approach took an additional 13 hours to train over the same number of epochs, but it delivers significantly better performance than the baseline.

This sensitivity necessitates further analysis comparing our approach to Moco-v2. These experiments aim to explore which model learns better semantic features and produces more robust representations under different data augmentations. As shown in Figure 4, both models are affected by the removal of certain data augmentations. However, our approach shows a more invariant representation and exhibits less performance degradation due to transformation manipulation compared to vanilla MoCo- v2. For instance, when we apply only random cropping augmentation, the performance of vanilla MoCo-v2 drops by 28 percentage points (from a baseline of 67.5% to 39.5% with only random cropping). In contrast, our approach experiences a decrease of only 25 percentage points (from a baseline of 71.7% to 46.6% with only random cropping). This indicates that our approach learns 8 improved semantic features and produces more effective representations for the given objects than vanilla MoCo-v2. graph3.pdf Figure 4: Decrease in top-1 accuracy (in % points) of LeOCLR and our reproduc- tion of vanilla MoCo-v2 after 200 epochs, under linear evaluation on ImageNet-1K.

In the ablation study, we compare the fine-tuned representa- tions of our approach with the reproduced vanilla MoCo-v2 across 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 50%, and 100% of the ImageNet-1K dataset. In this setting, we observe that tuning a LeOCLR representation consistently outperforms vanilla MoCo-v2. For instance, Figure 3 (a) demonstrates that LeOCLR fine-tuned with 10% of ImageNet-1K labeled data outperforms vanilla Moco-v2 fine-tuned with 20% of labeled data. This indicates that our approach is advantageous when the labeled data for downstream tasks is limited. 5.5 Attraction Strategy In this subsection, we apply a random crop to the original image (x) and attract the two views (x1, x2) toward it to evaluate its impact on our approach’s performance. We also conducted an experiment where all views were attracted to each other. However, in our method, we avoid attracting the two views to each other, enforcing the model to draw the two views toward the original image only (i.e., the uncropped image containing semantic features for all crops). For these experiments, we pre-trained the model on ImageNet-1K for 200 epochs using the same hyperparameters employed in the main experiment. The experiments in Table 8 underscore the significance of the information shared between the two views. They also highlight the importance of leveraging the original image and avoiding the attraction of views containing varied semantic information to preserve the semantic features of the objects. When we create a random crop of the original image (x) and force the model to make the two views similar to the original image (i.e., LeOCLR(Random original image)), the model performance decreases by 2.4%. This performance reduction occurs because cropping the original image and compelling the model to attract the two views towards it increases the probability of having two views with differing semantic information, resulting in a loss of semantic features of the objects. The situation deteriorates when we attract all views (x, x1, x2) to each other in LeOCLR (attract all crops), causing performance to drop closer to that of vanilla MoCo-v2 (67.5%). This decline is attributed to the high likelihood of attracting two views containing distinct semantic information. 9 Table 8: Comparisons of augmentation strategies using our proposed approach after 200 epochs.

P062.pdf,"Estimating Causal Effects Using a Cross-Moment Method Abstract This paper explores the adaptation of large pretrained models to new tasks while preserving their inherent equivariance properties. Equivariance, the property of a model’s output changing predictably with transformations of its input, is crucial for many applications, particularly in domains with inherent symmetries such as image processing and physics simulations. However, standard adaptation techniques often disrupt this crucial property, leading to a loss of performance and generalization ability. We propose a novel method that leverages [1, 2] to maintain equivariance during the adaptation process. Our approach incorporates a regularization term that penalizes deviations from the desired equivariant behavior, ensuring that the adapted model retains its symmetry properties. This is achieved through a carefully designed loss function that combines standard task-specific losses with an equivariance-preserving constraint. 1 Introduction Equivariance, a crucial property where a model’s output transforms predictably with input transfor- mations, is vital for numerous applications, especially in domains exhibiting inherent symmetries like image processing and physics simulations. Large pretrained models, while powerful, often lose this crucial equivariance during adaptation to new tasks using standard techniques. This loss can significantly impact performance and generalization. The inherent symmetries present in many datasets are often exploited implicitly or explicitly by the model architecture. For example, con- volutional neural networks implicitly leverage translation equivariance, while other architectures are designed to explicitly incorporate other symmetries. However, standard fine-tuning or transfer learning methods often disrupt these inherent symmetries, leading to a degradation in performance and robustness. This is particularly problematic when dealing with large pretrained models, where the computational cost of retraining can be prohibitive. Furthermore, the loss of equivariance can lead to unpredictable behavior and reduced generalization capabilities, especially when the test data differs significantly from the training data in terms of transformations. This necessitates the development of novel adaptation techniques that explicitly preserve equivariance. This paper addresses the challenge of adapting large pretrained models to new tasks while preserving their inherent equivariance. We introduce a novel method that leverages regularization techniques to maintain equivariance during the adaptation process. Our approach carefully balances the need to optimize for task-specific performance with the constraint of preserving the model’s equivariant properties. This is achieved through a carefully designed loss function that combines standard task- specific losses with an additional term that penalizes deviations from the desired equivariant behavior. The regularization term is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different types of transformations and model architectures. This allows our method to be applied to a wide range of problems and models. The key innovation lies in the formulation of the regularization term, which is derived from the theoretical properties of equivariant functions and carefully tuned to avoid over-regularization. The proposed method is rigorously evaluated on a diverse set of benchmark datasets, showcasing significant performance improvements over existing adaptation techniques. We demonstrate that our approach effectively preserves equivariance while achieving state-of-the-art results on several . challenging tasks. A comprehensive analysis of the impact of different hyperparameters on both performance and equivariance provides valuable insights into optimal configurations for various scenarios. The results highlight the critical importance of preserving equivariance during model adaptation and underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our findings suggest that incorporating equivariance constraints during adaptation is a promising avenue for enhancing the robustness and generalization capabilities of large pretrained models. Our work contributes to the growing field of equivariant neural networks ??, extending its scope to the complex problem of model adaptation. We provide a valuable tool for adapting large pretrained models while retaining their desirable properties. The ability to maintain equivariance during adaptation opens up new possibilities for deploying these models in applications where symmetry is paramount. Future research will focus on extending our method to more intricate scenarios and exploring its applications in diverse domains. We believe that our approach represents a significant step towards developing more robust and reliable adaptation techniques for large pretrained models. Finally, we acknowledge the limitations of our approach and propose avenues for future research. While our method demonstrates substantial improvements in preserving equivariance, challenges remain. For instance, enforcing equivariance constraints can be computationally expensive, especially for large models and complex transformations. Future work will focus on developing more efficient algorithms to mitigate this computational burden. Furthermore, we plan to explore the application of our method to a broader range of tasks and datasets, further validating its generality and robustness. The potential for improving the efficiency and scalability of our method is a key focus for future research. 2 Related Work The adaptation of large pretrained models has been a significant area of research, with various techniques proposed to improve performance on downstream tasks. Fine-tuning, transfer learning, and other adaptation strategies have shown remarkable success in many applications. However, these methods often neglect the crucial aspect of preserving the inherent equivariance properties of the pretrained models. Our work directly addresses this limitation by explicitly incorporating equivariance constraints during the adaptation process. This contrasts with existing approaches that primarily focus on optimizing task-specific performance without considering the potential loss of equivariance. The preservation of equivariance is particularly important in domains where symmetries play a crucial role, such as image processing, physics simulations, and robotics. Existing methods often fail to capture these symmetries effectively, leading to suboptimal performance and reduced generalization capabilities. Early work on equivariant neural networks focused on designing architectures that explicitly incor- porate symmetries into their structure. Groups such as the rotation group SO(2) and the translation group have been extensively studied, leading to the development of specialized layers and architec- tures that exhibit desired equivariance properties. These architectures, while effective in specific scenarios, often lack the flexibility and scalability required for adapting large pretrained models. Our approach offers a more general framework that can be applied to a wider range of architectures and transformations, without requiring significant modifications to the model structure. This flexibility is crucial for adapting large pretrained models, which often have complex and highly specialized architectures. Recent research has explored the use of regularization techniques to encourage equivariance in neural networks. These methods typically involve adding penalty terms to the loss function that penalize deviations from the desired equivariant behavior. However, many of these approaches are computationally expensive or require significant modifications to the training process. Our method offers a more efficient and practical approach, leveraging a carefully designed regularization term that can be easily integrated into existing training pipelines. The key innovation lies in the formulation of this regularization term, which is derived from the theoretical properties of equivariant functions and carefully tuned to avoid over-regularization. This ensures that the adapted model retains its equivariance properties without sacrificing performance on the downstream task. Furthermore, our work builds upon the growing body of research on incorporating inductive biases into neural networks. Inductive biases, which encode prior knowledge about the problem domain, have been shown to significantly improve the efficiency and generalization capabilities of neural 2 networks. Equivariance is a powerful inductive bias that can be leveraged to improve the performance of models on tasks with inherent symmetries. Our approach provides a principled way to incorporate this inductive bias during the adaptation process, ensuring that the adapted model benefits from the prior knowledge encoded in the pretrained model while still adapting effectively to the new task. This combination of leveraging pretrained knowledge and enforcing equivariance is a key contribution of our work. In summary, our work differs from existing approaches by explicitly addressing the preservation of equivariance during the adaptation of large pretrained models. We propose a novel method that combines task-specific optimization with a carefully designed regularization term to maintain equivariance. This approach offers a flexible and efficient way to adapt large pretrained models while preserving their desirable properties, leading to improved performance and generalization capabilities. Our work contributes to the growing field of equivariant neural networks and provides a valuable tool for adapting these models to new tasks in various domains. The ability to maintain equivariance during adaptation opens up new possibilities for deploying these models in applications where symmetry is paramount. 3 Methodology This section details the proposed method for equivariant adaptation of large pretrained models. Our approach leverages a novel regularization technique to maintain the model’s inherent equivariance properties during the adaptation process. The core idea is to augment the standard task-specific loss function with an additional term that penalizes deviations from the desired equivariant behavior. This ensures that the adapted model retains its symmetry properties while still achieving high performance on the new task. The regularization term is carefully designed to be flexible and adaptable to different types of transformations and model architectures, allowing for broad applicability. We achieve this flexibility by parameterizing the regularization term to account for various transformation groups and their associated representations. This allows us to handle a wide range of symmetries, from simple translations and rotations to more complex transformations. The specific form of the regularization term is derived from the theoretical properties of equivariant functions, ensuring a principled approach to preserving equivariance. Furthermore, we employ techniques to prevent over- regularization, ensuring that the model’s performance on the target task is not unduly compromised. The hyperparameters controlling the strength of the regularization are carefully tuned through cross- validation to find the optimal balance between equivariance preservation and task performance. The adaptation process begins by initializing the model with the weights of a pre-trained equivariant model. We then define a composite loss function that combines a standard task-specific loss (e.g., cross-entropy for classification, mean squared error for regression) with our proposed equivariance- preserving regularization term. The task-specific loss encourages the model to perform well on the new task, while the regularization term ensures that the model’s output transforms predictably under the relevant transformations. The specific form of the regularization term depends on the type of equivariance being preserved and the model architecture. For instance, for translation equivariance, the regularization term might penalize differences in the model’s output when the input is translated. For rotational equivariance, the regularization term might penalize differences in the model’s output when the input is rotated. The choice of regularization term is crucial for the success of our method, and we provide a detailed analysis of different regularization strategies in the supplementary material. The entire process is optimized using standard gradient-based optimization techniques, such as stochastic gradient descent or Adam. A key aspect of our methodology is the careful selection and tuning of hyperparameters. These hyperparameters control the strength of the regularization term, the type of transformations considered, and other aspects of the adaptation process. We employ a rigorous hyperparameter search strategy, using techniques such as grid search or Bayesian optimization, to identify the optimal configuration for each dataset and task. The performance of the adapted model is evaluated using standard metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks, and mean squared error and R-squared for regression tasks. In addition to these standard metrics, we also evaluate the degree of equivariance preserved by the adapted model using quantitative measures. These measures assess how well the model’s output transforms according to the expected equivariance properties under various transformations. This allows us to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of our regularization technique in preserving equivariance during the adaptation process. 3 The computational cost of enforcing equivariance constraints can be significant, especially for large models and complex transformations. To mitigate this, we explore various optimization strategies, including efficient computation of the regularization term and the use of specialized hardware accelerators. We also investigate the use of approximation techniques to reduce the computational burden without significantly compromising the accuracy of the equivariance preservation. These strategies are crucial for making our method scalable and applicable to a wide range of models and tasks. The efficiency of our method is a key focus of our experimental evaluation, and we provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost and scalability of our approach. Furthermore, we explore the trade-off between computational cost and the degree of equivariance preservation, providing insights into the optimal balance for different scenarios. In summary, our methodology provides a principled and flexible framework for adapting large pretrained models while preserving their equivariance properties. The key components are a carefully designed regularization term, a robust hyperparameter search strategy, and efficient optimization techniques. The combination of these elements allows us to achieve high performance on downstream tasks while maintaining the desirable equivariance properties of the pretrained model. This approach opens up new possibilities for deploying large pretrained models in applications where symmetry plays a crucial role, such as image processing, physics simulations, and robotics. The flexibility and scalability of our method make it applicable to a wide range of models and tasks, paving the way for more robust and reliable adaptation techniques in the future. 4 Experiments This section details the experimental setup, datasets used, and results obtained using our proposed method for equivariant adaptation of large pretrained models. We evaluate our approach on a range of benchmark datasets representing diverse domains and transformation groups, demonstrating its broad applicability and effectiveness. The datasets selected encompass scenarios with varying levels of complexity in terms of the underlying symmetries and the difficulty of the downstream tasks. This allows for a comprehensive assessment of our method’s performance across different scenarios and its robustness to variations in data characteristics. We compare our method against several state-of-the-art adaptation techniques, including standard fine-tuning, transfer learning with various regularization strategies, and other methods designed to preserve specific types of equivariance. This comparative analysis provides a clear demonstration of the advantages of our proposed approach in terms of both performance and equivariance preservation. The experiments are designed to rigorously assess the impact of different hyperparameters on the performance and equivariance of the adapted models, providing valuable insights into the optimal configuration for various scenarios. We also analyze the computational cost of our method and compare it to the computational cost of alternative approaches. Our experimental setup involves training several large pretrained models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), on various datasets. For each dataset, we consider different downstream tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and graph classification. The pretrained models are chosen based on their suitability for the specific task and their inherent equivariance properties. For example, for image classification tasks, we use CNNs known for their translation equivariance, while for graph classification tasks, we use GNNs designed to handle various graph transformations. The adaptation process involves fine-tuning the pretrained models using our proposed method, which incorporates an equivariance-preserving regularization term into the loss function. The hyperparameters of our method, including the strength of the regularization term and the type of transformations considered, are carefully tuned using a grid search approach. The performance of the adapted models is evaluated using standard metrics appropriate for the specific task, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks, and mean squared error and R-squared for regression tasks. In addition to these standard metrics, we also evaluate the degree of equivariance preserved by the adapted models using quantitative measures. The results presented in Tables 3 and 4 demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to existing adaptation techniques. We observe significant improvements in both accuracy and equivariance preservation across various datasets and tasks. The computational cost of our method is comparable to other advanced techniques, indicating that the added benefit of equivariance preservation does not come at the expense of excessive computational overhead. Further analysis reveals that the optimal hyperparameter settings vary depending on the specific dataset and 4 Method Accuracy Equivariance Score Standard Fine-tuning 0.85 0.60 Transfer Learning 0.88 0.65 Method A [5] 0.90 0.70 Method B [6] 0.92 0.75 Our Method 0.95 0.85 Table 1: Comparison of our method with other state-of-the-art adaptation techniques on a benchmark image classification dataset.

The robustness of our method is also demonstrated by its consistent performance across different datasets and tasks, indicating its general applicability and potential for broad impact. The detailed analysis of the results, including error bars and statistical significance tests, is provided in the supplementary material. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in preserving equivariance during the adaptation of large pretrained models. The results consistently show improvements in both task performance and equivariance preservation compared to existing techniques. The flexibility of our approach allows it to be applied to a wide range of models and tasks, making it a valuable tool for adapting large pretrained models in various domains. Future work will focus on extending our method to more complex scenarios and exploring its application in different domains, such as robotics and physics simulations, where equivariance is crucial for reliable and robust performance. We also plan to investigate more efficient optimization strategies to further reduce the computational cost of our method, making it even more scalable and applicable to larger models and more complex tasks. 5 Results This section presents the results of our experiments evaluating the proposed method for equivariant adaptation of large pretrained models. We conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets, comparing our approach against state-of-the-art adaptation techniques. Our evaluation focuses on two key aspects: (1) performance on the target task, measured using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (for classification), and mean squared error (MSE), R-squared (for regression); and (2) preservation of equivariance, assessed using quantitative measures that capture the consistency of the model’s output under various transformations. The datasets were chosen to represent diverse domains and transformation groups, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of our method’s robustness and generalizability. We considered various downstream tasks, including image classification, object detection, and graph classification, to demonstrate the broad applicability of our approach. The hyperparameters of our method were carefully tuned using a grid search approach to optimize performance and equivariance preservation. Table 3 shows the results of our experiments on an image classification dataset. We compare our method against standard fine-tuning, transfer learning, and two other state-of-the-art equivariance- preserving adaptation methods (Method A [5] and Method B [6]). Our method achieves the highest accuracy (95%) and the best equivariance score (85%), significantly outperforming the other methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in preserving equivariance while achieving high performance on the target task. The improved equivariance score suggests that our method successfully maintains the model’s inherent symmetry properties during adaptation, leading to better 5 generalization and robustness. The superior accuracy indicates that our method does not compromise task performance in the pursuit of equivariance preservation. Further analysis of the confusion matrices revealed that our method significantly reduced misclassifications in challenging cases, particularly those involving transformations of the input images. Table 4 presents the results on a regression task. Here, we compare our method with standard fine-tuning and transfer learning, focusing on MSE and computational time. Our method achieves the lowest MSE (0.08), indicating superior predictive accuracy. While the computational time is slightly higher (1800s) compared to standard fine-tuning (1200s), the significant improvement in accuracy justifies the increased computational cost. The increase in computational time is primarily due to the additional computation required for the equivariance-preserving regularization term. However, this overhead is manageable and does not significantly hinder the practicality of our method. Further optimization strategies, such as efficient computation of the regularization term and the use of specialized hardware, could further reduce the computational cost. Figure ?? (included in the supplementary material) visually demonstrates the equivariance preserva- tion achieved by our method. The figure shows the model’s output under various transformations of the input, highlighting the consistent and predictable changes in the output, which is a hallmark of equivariance. This visual representation complements the quantitative measures presented in Tables 3 and 4, providing a more comprehensive understanding of our method’s effectiveness. The supplementary material also includes a detailed analysis of the impact of different hyperparameters on both performance and equivariance, providing valuable insights into the optimal configuration for various scenarios. We also present a comprehensive error analysis, including error bars and statistical significance tests, to ensure the robustness of our findings. In summary, our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method for equivariant adaptation of large pretrained models. We consistently observe significant improve- ments in both task performance and equivariance preservation across various datasets and tasks. The computational cost is manageable, and the benefits in terms of accuracy and robustness justify the increased computational overhead. Our findings highlight the importance of preserving equivariance during model adaptation and underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method in achieving this goal. These results pave the way for more robust and reliable adaptation techniques for large pretrained models in various domains.

Our approach leverages a carefully designed regularization term that penalizes deviations from the desired equivariant behavior, ensuring that the adapted model retains its symmetry properties. This regularization term is flexible and adaptable to different types 6 of transformations and model architectures, allowing for broad applicability. The experimental results, conducted on a diverse set of benchmark datasets and tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving state-of-the-art performance while significantly improving equivariance preservation compared to existing adaptation techniques. The superior performance is consistently observed across various datasets and tasks, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of our approach. The computational cost, while slightly higher than standard fine-tuning, is justified by the significant improvements in accuracy and equivariance. A key contribution of this work is the development of a principled and flexible framework for incorporating equivariance constraints during model adaptation. This framework allows for the effective utilization of the inductive biases encoded in pretrained models while still achieving high performance on new tasks. The ability to maintain equivariance during adaptation is crucial for many applications, particularly in domains with inherent symmetries, where standard adaptation techniques often fail to capture these symmetries effectively. Our method addresses this limitation by explicitly incorporating equivariance constraints into the training process, leading to more robust and reliable models. The flexibility of our approach allows it to be applied to a wide range of models and tasks, making it a valuable tool for adapting large pretrained models in various domains. Future work will focus on several key areas. First, we plan to explore more efficient optimization strategies to further reduce the computational cost of our method, making it even more scalable and applicable to larger models and more complex tasks. This includes investigating the use of specialized hardware accelerators and approximation techniques to reduce the computational burden without significantly compromising the accuracy of equivariance preservation. Second, we will extend our method to more complex scenarios, such as adapting models to tasks with multiple types of transformations or incorporating more sophisticated representations of the transformation groups. Third, we will explore the application of our method to a wider range of tasks and datasets, further validating its generality and robustness. This includes investigating its applicability in domains such as robotics and physics simulations, where equivariance is crucial for reliable and robust performance. Finally, we acknowledge the limitations of our current approach. While our method demonstrates significant improvements in preserving equivariance during adaptation, there are still challenges to overcome. For instance, the computational cost of enforcing equivariance constraints can be significant, particularly for large models and complex transformations. Future work will focus on developing more efficient algorithms to address this issue. Furthermore, the optimal hyperparameter settings may vary depending on the specific dataset and task, requiring careful tuning for optimal performance. Despite these limitations, our work represents a significant advancement in the field of model adaptation, providing a principled way to preserve equivariance while achieving high performance. We believe that our approach will inspire further investigations into the interplay between equivariance, adaptation, and generalization in large pretrained models. The ability to maintain equivariance during adaptation opens up new possibilities for deploying these models in various applications where symmetry plays a crucial role. In conclusion, our proposed method offers a significant advancement in the field of model adaptation, providing a principled way to preserve equivariance while achieving high performance. This is particularly important for applications where the underlying symmetries of the data are crucial for accurate and reliable predictions. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the potential for further research in this area. We anticipate that our work will inspire further investigations into the interplay between equivariance, adaptation, and generalization in large pretrained models. The development of more efficient algorithms and the exploration of more complex scenarios will be key focuses of future research. The ability to effectively leverage the inductive biases encoded in pretrained models while adapting to new tasks is a crucial step towards building more robust and reliable AI systems. 7",1,,,,
P063.pdf,"Representation Transferability in Neural Networks Across Datasets and Tasks Abstract Deep neural networks, which are built from multiple layers with hierarchical distributed representations, tend to learn low-level features in their initial layers and shift to high-level features in subsequent layers. Transfer learning, multi-task learning, and continual learning paradigms leverage this hierarchical distributed representation to share knowledge across different datasets and tasks. This paper studies the layer-wise transferability of representations in deep networks across several datasets and tasks, noting interesting empirical observations. 1 Introduction Deep networks, constructed with multiple layers and hierarchical distributed representations, learn low-level features in initial layers and shift to high-level features as the network becomes deeper. Generic hierarchical distributed representations allow for the sharing of knowledge across datasets and tasks in paradigms such as transfer learning, multi-task learning, and continual learning. In transfer learning, for example, the transfer of low-level features from one dataset to another can boost performance on the target task when data is limited, provided that the datasets are related. Transferring high-level features, with the learning of low-level features, can also be useful when the tasks are similar but the data distributions differ slightly. This paper studies the layer-wise transferability of representations in deep networks across several datasets and tasks, and reports some interesting observations. First, we demonstrate that the layer-wise transferability between datasets or tasks can be non-symmetric, with features learned from a source dataset being more relevant to a target dataset, despite similar sizes. Secondly, the characteristics of the datasets or tasks and their relationship have a greater effect on the layer-wise transferability of representations than factors such as the network architecture. Third, we propose that the layer-wise transferability of representations can be a proxy for measuring task relatedness. These observations emphasize the importance of curriculum methods and structured approaches to designing systems for multiple tasks that maximize knowledge transfer and minimize interference between datasets or tasks. 2 Citation Networks 2.1 Methods We have produced a citation graph using citation data from NeurIPS papers from SemanticScholar, and institutional information about authors from AMiner. From the NeurIPS website, we first gathered all paper titles from 2012 to 2021. We then mapped the paper titles to their Semantic Scholar paper IDs using the Semantic Scholar Academic Graph (S2AG) API. Unmatched papers were manually searched for, with all but one being found in the Semantic Scholar database. For each paper, we used the S2AG API to identify authors, and the authors of their references. We used AMiner to identify institutional information for each author. The 9460 NeurIPS papers contain 135,941 authors, with institutions found for 83,515 (61%) of them. Papers lacking author . information were removed from our dataset. We then marked institutes automatically by country name and common cities and regions in China. We supplemented automatic annotations with existing regional matchings and added 364 additional rules for regional matching. We also removed major multinational corporate labs. Of the remaining 5422 papers, we removed papers that were not from China, the US, or Europe, or included collaborators from multiple regions, leaving us with 1792 papers. Finally, we calculated the average number and proportion of citations between papers from each region. 2.2 Results Our results show how American and Chinese papers fail to cite each other. While 60% of the data set comes from American papers, they only compose 34% of Chinese citations. American citations of Chinese papers are even more dramatic, with the 34% of the dataset coming from Chinese papers only accounting for 9% of American citations. These numbers are even more significant when compared to American citations of European papers; we found that American institutions cite European papers more often than Chinese papers despite our dataset containing six times more Chinese papers than European. Each region tends to cite its own papers more often: China 21%, the USA 41%, and Europe 14%. The separation between American and Chinese research is more pronounced than would be expected based solely on regional preference. American and European research communities demonstrate similar citation patterns with few citations to Chinese papers. Chinese institutions, on the other hand, cite both American and European papers less than either of those regions. USA China Europe USA 41 9 12 China 34 21 6 Europe 15 9 14 Table 1: Proportion of papers from given regions citing other regions or endogenously. Values are in percentage. 3 Limitations The results presented here have some limitations. Firstly, while we have labeled the work of any university located in the United States as American, it is possible that such labs still have close ties to China, leading to an underestimate of the divide between US and Chinese AI research. Secondly, we have excluded papers where author information was not available on AMiner, a Chinese company, and therefore, there could be more Chinese papers in our dataset than we have determined. The 43% of discarded papers due to missing author information also likely represent a biased sample. 4 Consequences While American and Chinese researchers publish in the same venues, they represent two parallel communities with limited impact on each other’s research. This can, partly, be attributed to differing research interests arising from distinct cultural norms that influence research priorities. For instance, multi-object tracking is an active area of research in China with large scale benchmarks, whereas, concerns surrounding misuse of biometric data in North America have led researchers there to avoid such research. Likewise, US researchers are heavily represented at conferences regarding fairness in AI, while the Chinese are not. This separation impacts not only the research topics, but also how they evolve. In addition, abstract topics or architectures that are popular in one region may not be popular in the other. For example, PCANet which is a popular image classification architecture has most of its 1200 citations from East Asian institutions, while Deep Forests has most of its 600 citations from Chinese institutions. Another limitation is related to differences in the approach to ethics. The North American and Euro- pean AI communities have begun to publish research on the ethics of AI and have included systems 2 for reviewers to flag ethical concerns and ask authors to provide ethics statements. Engagement with Chinese researchers in this topic remains limited, even though ethics statements from Chinese AI institutions show many similarities to western ones. A clear example of this disconnect is the Provisional Draft of the NeurIPS Code of Ethics where, at the time of initial publication, all the authors were based in the US or Australia, but none were based in Asia. Although similar statements exist across regions, disagreements in research practice still arise. One such example is where Duke University stopped using the Duke-MTMC dataset because researchers had not obtained consent from the students they collected images from, yet similar datasets like Market-1501 from China continue to be used. The divide between these two communities impacts individual researchers, the machine learning community as a whole, and potentially the societies impacted by AI research, highlighting the need for a discussion to overcome this barrier. 3",0,,,,
P064.pdf,"Flow-Based Feature Fusion for Collaborative 3D Object Detection Abstract The goal of this paper is to empower open-source large language models (LLMs) such as LLaMA, Vicuna, and OPT to effectively utilize multi-modal tools for tasks involving visual comprehension and image generation. By leveraging a self-instruction framework, the authors aim to overcome limitations in proprietary LLMs, such as GPT-3.5, by enabling open models to handle both seen and unseen tools in zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios. This approach addresses the critical need for accessible and adaptable large language models capable of interacting with the real world through diverse modalities. The proposed methodology focuses on enhancing the model’s ability to understand and utilize tool descriptions, enabling seamless integration with a wide range of visual tools without requiring extensive retraining. This is achieved through a novel combination of prompt engineering and reinforcement learning techniques. 1 Introduction The goal of this paper is to empower open-source large language models (LLMs) such as LLaMA, Vicuna, and OPT to effectively utilize multi-modal tools for tasks involving visual comprehension and image generation. This is a significant challenge, as current open-source LLMs often lack the sophisticated capabilities of their proprietary counterparts, such as GPT-3.5, particularly in handling complex interactions with external tools. Our approach focuses on bridging this gap by leveraging a novel self-instruction framework. This framework allows these open-source models to learn to utilize a diverse range of tools, both seen and unseen, in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, thereby significantly expanding their functional capabilities. The key innovation lies in our ability to teach the models to understand and interpret tool descriptions, enabling seamless integration with new tools without requiring extensive retraining. This is achieved through a carefully designed combination of prompt engineering and reinforcement learning techniques, which we detail in subsequent sections. The resulting system demonstrates a remarkable ability to generalize to unseen tools and tasks, showcasing the robustness and adaptability of our approach. Our self-instruction framework addresses a critical need in the field of large language models: the development of accessible and adaptable models capable of interacting with the real world through diverse modalities. Existing methods often rely on extensive fine-tuning or complex architectures, limiting their applicability and scalability. In contrast, our approach emphasizes simplicity and efficiency, making it suitable for a wide range of open-source LLMs and tools. The modular design of our framework allows for easy integration of new tools and tasks, fostering a continuous improvement cycle driven by iterative instruction generation, model training, and performance evaluation. This iterative process ensures that the model’s capabilities are constantly refined and expanded, leading to a more robust and versatile system. The core of our method involves generating a diverse and representative dataset of instructions and corresponding tool usage examples. These examples are carefully crafted to cover a wide range of scenarios and complexities, ensuring that the model is exposed to a rich and varied learning experience. The use of reinforcement learning further enhances the model’s ability to learn optimal . tool usage strategies, going beyond simple imitation learning to develop a deeper understanding of the task and the tools available. This allows the model to not only execute tasks correctly but also to select the most appropriate tools for a given situation, demonstrating a level of strategic thinking not typically observed in simpler approaches. The resulting system exhibits a remarkable capacity to adapt its tool usage strategies based on the specific requirements of the task, highlighting the effectiveness of our self-instruction framework. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate significant improvements in performance across various visual tasks, including image captioning, visual question answering, and image generation. Our results show that the model is able to generalize effectively to unseen tools, achieving performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of proprietary LLMs on similar tasks. This underscores the potential of open-source LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art results when equipped with the right tools and training methodologies. The detailed analysis of our results provides valuable insights into the interplay between language understanding, tool selection, and task execution, highlighting the crucial role of accurate instruction interpretation in successful tool utilization. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in multi-modal settings. Future work will focus on expanding the range of supported tools and tasks, exploring more sophis- ticated reinforcement learning techniques, and investigating the incorporation of user feedback to personalize the model’s behavior. We also plan to explore the potential of incorporating uncertainty estimation into the model’s decision-making process, allowing it to handle ambiguous situations more effectively. The ultimate goal is to create a truly versatile and user-friendly system that empow- ers users to leverage the power of open-source LLMs for a wide range of real-world applications, democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities. 2 Related Work The integration of large language models (LLMs) with external tools has emerged as a significant area of research [1, 2]. Early work focused primarily on integrating LLMs with specific tools, often requiring significant engineering effort for each new tool [3]. These approaches lacked the generality and adaptability needed for seamless integration with a diverse range of tools. Our work builds upon these efforts by proposing a self-instruction framework that enables LLMs to learn to utilize tools in a more generalizable manner. This contrasts with previous methods that often relied on extensive fine-tuning or complex architectures, limiting their scalability and applicability. Our approach emphasizes simplicity and efficiency, making it suitable for a wide range of open-source LLMs and tools. The modular design of our framework allows for easy integration of new tools and tasks, fostering a continuous improvement cycle driven by iterative instruction generation, model training, and performance evaluation. Several recent studies have explored the use of reinforcement learning (RL) for tool use in LLMs [4, 5]. These methods typically involve training an RL agent to select and utilize tools based on a reward signal. However, these approaches often require significant amounts of labeled data or carefully designed reward functions, which can be challenging to obtain. Our self-instruction framework addresses these limitations by leveraging a combination of prompt engineering and RL, allowing the model to learn from a diverse set of instructions and tool usage examples without requiring extensive labeled data. The iterative nature of our framework allows for continuous improvement, leading to more robust and adaptable tool usage strategies. Furthermore, our focus on open-source LLMs distinguishes our work from previous studies that primarily focused on proprietary models. The use of self-instruction for improving LLM capabilities has gained increasing attention [6, 7]. These methods typically involve generating a large dataset of instructions and corresponding responses, which are then used to fine-tune the LLM. Our work extends this approach by incorporating tool usage into the self-instruction framework. This allows the model to learn not only to generate appropriate responses but also to select and utilize the appropriate tools for a given task. The integration of tool usage into the self-instruction process is a key innovation that distinguishes our work from previous studies. This allows for a more holistic approach to LLM training, leading to more robust and versatile models. Our approach also relates to work on multi-modal learning [8, 9], which focuses on integrating different modalities, such as text and images, into a unified framework. While many multi-modal 2 models have been developed, they often lack the ability to seamlessly integrate with external tools. Our work bridges this gap by providing a framework for integrating LLMs with multi-modal tools, enabling them to perform complex tasks involving visual comprehension and image generation. The ability to handle both seen and unseen tools in zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios is a key advantage of our approach. This allows for greater flexibility and adaptability, making it suitable for a wider range of applications. Finally, our work contributes to the broader goal of democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities. By focusing on open-source LLMs and providing a simple, efficient, and scalable framework for tool integration, we aim to empower researchers and developers to build more powerful and versatile AI systems. The modular design of our framework allows for easy extension and customization, making it suitable for a wide range of applications and user needs. The ability to generalize to unseen tools and tasks is a crucial aspect of our approach, ensuring that the resulting systems are robust and adaptable to evolving requirements. 3 Methodology Our methodology centers on a self-instruction framework designed to empower open-source LLMs like LLaMA, Vicuna, and OPT to effectively utilize multi-modal tools for visual comprehension and image generation tasks. This framework directly addresses the limitations of these open-source models compared to proprietary counterparts such as GPT-3.5, particularly in handling complex interactions with external tools. The core of our approach lies in enabling these open-source models to handle both seen and unseen tools in zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios. This is achieved through a novel combination of prompt engineering and reinforcement learning techniques, meticulously designed to enhance the model’s understanding and utilization of tool descriptions. The framework’s modularity allows for seamless integration of a wide range of visual tools without extensive retraining, a significant advantage over existing methods that often require substantial model re-adaptation for each new tool. This efficiency is crucial for scalability and broad applicability. The self-instruction process begins with the generation of a diverse dataset comprising instructions and corresponding tool usage examples. These examples are carefully crafted to encompass a wide spectrum of task complexities and scenarios, ensuring the model receives a rich and varied learning experience. The diversity of the dataset is paramount in enabling the model to generalize effectively to unseen tools and tasks. The examples are designed to explicitly demonstrate the appropriate selection and application of tools for specific tasks, providing the model with clear guidance on how to leverage the tools effectively. This detailed instruction set is crucial for overcoming the limitations of simple imitation learning, allowing the model to develop a deeper understanding of the relationship between tasks, instructions, and tool usage. Reinforcement learning plays a crucial role in refining the model’s tool usage strategies. We employ a reward function that incentivizes the model to select and utilize tools optimally, leading to improved performance on the target tasks. The reward function is designed to consider both the correctness of the model’s output and the efficiency of its tool usage. This dual focus ensures that the model not only produces accurate results but also learns to select the most appropriate tools for a given situation, demonstrating a level of strategic thinking beyond simple imitation. The iterative nature of the reinforcement learning process allows for continuous improvement, leading to increasingly robust and adaptable tool usage strategies. This iterative refinement is key to achieving high performance on a wide range of tasks. The training process involves iteratively generating new instructions and tool usage examples based on the model’s performance. This iterative approach allows the model to learn from its mistakes and continuously improve its understanding of tool usage. The generated examples are carefully reviewed and curated to ensure their quality and relevance. This human-in-the-loop approach ensures that the model is trained on high-quality data, leading to improved performance. The iterative nature of the process also allows for the incorporation of new tools and tasks as needed, ensuring the framework’s adaptability and longevity. This continuous improvement cycle is a key differentiator of our approach, leading to a more robust and versatile system. Our evaluation focuses on a range of visual tasks, including image captioning, visual question answering, and image generation. We assess the model’s performance on both seen and unseen tools, evaluating its ability to generalize to new situations. We compare the performance of our 3 approach to existing methods, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency. The results highlight the effectiveness of our self-instruction framework in enabling open-source LLMs to achieve performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of proprietary models. Furthermore, detailed analysis of the model’s performance provides valuable insights into the interplay between language understanding, tool selection, and task execution, highlighting the crucial role of accurate instruction interpretation in successful tool utilization. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in multi-modal settings. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] 4 Experiments This section details the experimental setup, results, and analysis of our self-instruction framework for empowering open-source LLMs to utilize multi-modal tools.

The rigorous evaluation methodology ensures the reliability and validity of our results. Our dataset consists of a large collection of instructions and corresponding tool usage examples, carefully crafted to cover a wide range of scenarios and complexities. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring a robust evaluation of the model’s performance. The training set is used to train the model using our self-instruction framework, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and monitor the model’s performance during training. The test set is used to evaluate the final model’s performance on unseen data. The dataset includes examples of both seen and unseen tools, allowing us to assess the model’s ability to generalize to new tools. The diversity of the dataset is crucial for ensuring the robustness and generalizability of the model. The dataset is publicly available to facilitate reproducibility and further research. The data collection process involved a combination of automated generation and manual curation, ensuring the quality and relevance of the data. The dataset is designed to be easily extensible, allowing for the incorporation of new tools and tasks in the future. The model is evaluated on three key visual tasks: image captioning, visual question answering, and image generation. For image captioning, we measure the BLEU score and ROUGE score to assess the quality of the generated captions. For visual question answering, we measure the accuracy of the model’s answers. For image generation, we use Inception Score (IS) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) to evaluate the quality and diversity of the generated images. We compare the performance of our model to several baselines, including a model without tool integration and a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model. The results demonstrate significant improvements in performance across all three tasks, showcasing the effectiveness of our self-instruction framework. The model’s ability to generalize to unseen tools is also evaluated, demonstrating the robustness and adaptability of our approach. The detailed results are presented in the following tables. The results demonstrate that our self-instruction framework significantly improves the performance of open-source LLMs on various visual tasks, achieving performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of proprietary models. The model’s ability to generalize to unseen tools highlights the robustness and adaptability of our approach. Further analysis reveals that the model’s success is strongly correlated with its ability to accurately interpret instructions and select appropriate tools.

We conducted experiments across three key visual tasks: image captioning, visual question answering, and image generation. Our evaluation metrics included accu- racy, efficiency, and generalization capabilities, providing a comprehensive assessment of the model’s performance on both seen and unseen tools. We compared our approach to several baselines, includ- ing a model without tool integration and a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model, to highlight the improvements achieved through our self-instruction framework. The results demonstrate significant performance gains across all three tasks, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach in bridging the performance gap between open-source and proprietary LLMs. The detailed results are presented in the tables below, along with a comprehensive analysis of the findings. Our dataset, comprising a large collection of instructions and corresponding tool usage examples, was carefully crafted to cover a wide range of scenarios and complexities. It was split into training, validation, and test sets to ensure a robust evaluation of the model’s performance. The training set was used to train the model using our self-instruction framework, while the validation set was used for hyperparameter tuning and monitoring performance during training. The test set was used for evaluating the final model’s performance on unseen data, including examples with both seen and unseen tools. This rigorous evaluation methodology ensured the reliability and validity of our results, demonstrating the model’s ability to generalize to new and unseen tools and tasks. The dataset’s diversity was crucial for ensuring the robustness and generalizability of the model’s performance. For image captioning, we measured the BLEU and ROUGE scores to assess the quality of the generated captions. For visual question answering, we measured the accuracy of the model’s answers. For image generation, we used the Inception Score (IS) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) to evaluate the quality and diversity of the generated images. The results, presented in Tables 4, 5, and 6, demonstrate significant improvements in performance across all three tasks compared to the baselines. Our model consistently outperformed the baseline model without tool integration, showcasing the effectiveness of our tool integration strategy. Furthermore, the performance on unseen tools was remarkably close to that on seen tools, highlighting the model’s strong generalization capabilities. 5 Table 3: Performance on Image Generation Model Inception Score (IS) Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) Baseline (no tools) 8.5 35.2 Our Model (seen tools) 9.8 28.5 Our Model (unseen tools) 9.2 31.0 GPT-3.5 10.2 25.8 While GPT-3.5 still exhibited slightly higher performance, the results demonstrate that our approach significantly closes the performance gap between open-source and proprietary LLMs. Table 4: Performance on Image Captioning Model BLEU Score ROUGE Score Baseline (no tools) 0.65 0.72 Our Model (seen tools) 0.82 0.88 Our Model (unseen tools) 0.78 0.85 GPT-3.5 0.85 0.90 Table 5: Performance on Visual Question Answering Model Accuracy Baseline (no tools) 0.70 Our Model (seen tools) 0.85 Our Model (unseen tools) 0.80 GPT-3.5 0.88 Further analysis revealed a strong correlation between the model’s success and its ability to accurately interpret instructions and select appropriate tools.

Our approach directly addresses the limitations of these open-source models compared to their proprietary counterparts, such as GPT-3.5, particularly in handling complex interactions with external tools. The core of our method lies in its ability to enable these open-source models to handle both seen and unseen tools in zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios, significantly expanding their functional capabilities.

P065.pdf,"Assessing the Stability of Stable Diffusion in a Recursive Inpainting Scenario Abstract Generative Artificial Intelligence models for image generation have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tasks like text-to-image synthesis and image completion through inpainting. Inpainting performance can be measured by removing parts of an image, using the model to restore them, and comparing the result with the original. This process can be applied recursively, where the output of one inpainting operation becomes the input for the next. This recursive application can result in images that are either similar to or vastly different from the original, depending on the removed sections and the model’s ability to reconstruct them. The ability to recover an image similar to the original, even after numerous recursive inpainting operations, is a desirable characteristic referred to as stability. This concept is also being explored in the context of recursively training generative AI models with their own generated data. Recursive inpainting is a unique process that involves recursion only during inference, and understanding its behavior can provide valuable insights that complement ongoing research on the effects of recursion during training. This study investigates the effects of recursive inpainting on Stable Diffusion, a widely used image model. The findings indicate that recursive inpainting can result in image degradation, ultimately leading to a meaningless image, and that the final outcome is influenced by factors such as the image type, the size of the inpainting areas, and the number of iterations. 1 Introduction In the past two years, Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a central player, sparking a significant revolution in technology. These AI models are capable of producing text, audio, images, and video, finding applications in a wide array of transformative uses. Notable examples include Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT4, which excel at answering questions, summarizing, translating, and paraphrasing texts, and text-to-image generators like DALL-E, which can generate images based on almost any textual description. These tools have garnered widespread public interest, attracting hundreds of millions of users. These AI tools have reached exceptional performance levels in various tasks, making their evaluation a crucial aspect. For LLMs, numerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate their knowledge across different subjects, their proficiency in solving mathematical or reasoning problems, and their language comprehension. These benchmarks facilitate model comparisons, and when a new model is launched, its performance on these standard benchmarks is typically reported. In the realm of image generation, several metrics have been introduced to assess performance, including the Fr˘00e9chet Inception Distance (FID), precision and recall, and density and coverage. These metrics aim to quantify how closely generated images resemble real ones and how effectively they cover the spectrum of real images. Another capability offered by some AI image generation tools, and implemented through specialized AI models, is inpainting. In this process, the AI tool is provided with an image containing missing parts and is tasked with filling them in to complete the image. Assessing the quality of content produced by AI is crucial not only for comparing different AI models or evaluating their progress in specific tasks but also because the extensive use of generative AI is altering the fundamental nature of content found on the Internet. AI-generated texts and images are now widespread and, in some instances, predominant, with this trend expected to persist in the coming years. This has consequences for newer AI models, as they are frequently trained on data gathered from the Internet, establishing a feedback loop where new models are trained using data created by earlier AI models. This cycle can result in diminished performance or even the breakdown of AI models, prompting research into the stability of AI models when trained using their own generated data. The feedback loops in generative AI that have been examined thus far pertain to the training of newer models, creating a loop across different generations of AI models. However, other potential loops in generative AI exist that have not been previously investigated to the best of our knowledge. For instance, when the input to the AI model is an image and the output is also an image, as is the case with inpainting, the AI model can be recursively applied to its own output, forming a loop. In this scenario, there is no training involved, only inferences that are recursively applied. Examining the effects of these recursive applications of the AI model on the generated content is essential to determine whether the AI models remain stable or degrade, similar to what occurs in the training loop. In this research, we examine the inference feedback loop utilizing a renowned AI image model, Stable Diffusion, and its inpainting feature. A thorough empirical investigation is carried out to discern the conditions under which the model maintains stability and when it experiences degradation. The subsequent sections of this paper are structured as follows: Section 2 provides a concise overview of the inpainting feature and the feedback loops in generative AI. Section 3 introduces the inference loop, termed Recursive Inpainting (RIP), which is then assessed in Section 4. The constraints of our assessment, along with the findings, are deliberated in Section 5. The paper concludes with a summary in Section 6. 2 Preliminaries 2.1 Inpainting Inpainting is a function found in some contemporary generative AI image tools, which involves filling in missing portions of an image to complete it. The effectiveness of inpainting is contingent on the specific model used, the nature of the image, and the size and placement of the missing areas. Generally, inpainting can only restore a portion of the information that is lost in the missing image segments. Various metrics are available to assess the resemblance between the original image and the one reconstructed through inpainting. These range from traditional methods like Structural Similarity (SSIM) and multi-scale SSIM (MS-SSIM), which are based on pixel-level comparisons, to more sophisticated methods like Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) and Paired/Unpaired Inception Discriminative Score (P/U-IDS), which employ AI models to simulate human-like perceptual evaluations. 2.2 Recursiveness in Generative AI A cycle is formed where AI-generated content is posted online and subsequently collected to train newer AI models. This can result in a decline in the effectiveness of AI models, or even their failure, when they are trained using data they have produced themselves. This has sparked a growing interest in determining the circumstances under which these generative AI models maintain stability when trained recursively with data they generate. The stability is influenced by multiple factors, such as the specific model, the quantity of AI-generated data used in each retraining cycle, and whether the cycle involves one or multiple AI models. Investigating this cycle is crucial as it can affect not only the development of future AI models but also the type of content that will likely dominate the Internet in the future. In all these investigations, the recursive aspect involves training new AI models with data produced by other AI models. However, in certain situations, recursion can happen when the same AI model is used solely for making inferences. This particular scenario has not been explored in previous studies, to the best of our knowledge. 3 Recursive Inpainting (RIP) An intriguing aspect to note is that a distinct recursive loop can be established with AI image models when employing the inpainting technique. This process begins with an image, to which a mask is applied to obscure certain areas, and inpainting is utilized to fill in these areas. This results in a second image that has been partially generated by the AI image model. The procedure is then reiterated using a different mask to produce a subsequent image, this time entirely generated from AI-produced content. The process continues as inpainting is recursively applied to images that have already undergone inpainting. As parts of the images are removed and reconstructed, information is inevitably lost. However, it is crucial to determine whether this loss leads to images that are drastically different from the original, or if the images become simpler and less intricate. Alternatively, it is possible that the inpainting process remains stable, resulting in images that are merely variations of the original. Similar to the recursive training of models with their own data, it is important to understand the conditions under which inpainting remains stable or degrades under recursion. The consequences of recursive inpainting are influenced by numerous factors, including the specific AI model employed, the characteristics of the image, and the masks utilized in each iteration. It is reasonable to expect that more intricate images or masks that obscure larger portions of the image will have a higher likelihood of causing degradation. In the subsequent section, we outline the results of an extensive empirical investigation into recursive inpainting using Stable Diffusion, representing an initial effort to identify the primary factors that influence the effects of recursive inpainting. 4 Evaluation The primary factors influencing recursive inpainting are: 1. The AI model used. 2. The input images. 3. The masks applied at each stage. 4. The number of iterations. In our experimental setup, we utilized Stable Diffusion, which is a text-to-image latent diffusion model, due to its open-source nature and widespread use in the AI image model community. Specifically, we employed a version of Stable Diffusion 2 that was fine-tuned for inpainting. This model uses a technique for generating masks where the masked areas, along with the latent VAE representations of the masked image, provide additional conditioning for the inpainting process. The model’s parameters were kept at their default settings. We did not use any text prompts to direct the inpainting, allowing the model to concentrate on reconstructing the missing parts based solely on the remaining visual information without any textual guidance. 2 For the image selection, to minimize any potential bias, we randomly chose images from an extensive dataset containing over 81,000 art images of various types created by different artists. From this dataset, 100 images were randomly picked to form our evaluation set. The input images are 512x512 pixels; if their original aspect ratio is not square, blank areas are added to the sides to achieve the 512x512 format. In generating masks for inpainting, we divide the images into squares of a predetermined size. In each iteration, a square is randomly chosen to serve as the mask. To facilitate comparisons across different mask and image sizes, our experiments use the number of pixels inpainted relative to the image size as the primary parameter, rather than the number of inpainting operations. To assess the similarity to the original image across iterations, we employ the Learned Perceptual Image Path Similarity (LPIPS) metric, which is frequently used to evaluate inpainting quality. In our implementation, we utilize the features from three neural networks to calculate the metric: SqueezeNet, AlexNet, and VGG. We conducted recursive inpainting, altering 400% of the pixels, using masks of sizes 64x64, 128x128, and 256x256. To measure the degradation as inpainting operations are performed, we calculated the LPIPS metric between the original image and each subsequent generation using the features from the three neural networks (SqueezeNet, AlexNet, and VGG). The average distances for the 100 images at each 50% inpainting step are presented. The bars represent the standard deviation observed across the samples for each data point. Several initial observations can be drawn from these results: 1. As the recursive inpainting progresses, the distance from the original image increases, potentially leading to an image that bears no resemblance to the original. 2. The rate at which the distance increases tends to decrease, but it does not appear to stabilize even when the distance becomes substantial. 3. The discrepancy with the original image is more pronounced when larger masks are used for inpainting, which aligns with the expectation that larger blocks are more challenging to inpaint. 4. The three networks used for computing the LPIPS (SqueezeNet, AlexNet, and VGG) yield comparable results. 5. The significant standard deviation indicates that different images will exhibit varying behaviors. To gain a better understanding of the variability in distances for each image, scatter plots of the LPIPS distances for the 100 images for each neural network are presented. It is evident that there is considerable variability across images, but the general trends are consistent with those observed in the mean: the distance increases with more inpainting and with larger masks. Among the three networks (SqueezeNet, AlexNet, and VGG), VGG shows the fewest outliers. Given that VGG is the most complex network, it is expected to capture the image features more effectively. Consequently, we will only report results for VGG moving forward, although all metrics are available in the repository along with the images. To investigate whether the degradation is consistent across different runs, we selected 10 images from the set of 100 and performed 10 runs on each. The LPIPS metrics across these runs for three different images are displayed, using the VGG network, which generally exhibits the lowest deviations. It is noticeable that variations are more significant with larger masks, which is anticipated since larger masks require fewer iterations to reach a given percentage of inpainting, thus introducing more variability. The variations also decrease as the percentage of inpainting increases, indicating that a higher number of inpainting operations leads to reduced variability. This suggests that recursive inpainting tends to converge in terms of LPIPS distance as the process advances. 5 Conclusion and Future Work In this study, we have introduced and empirically examined the impact of recursive inpainting on AI image models. The findings reveal that recursion can result in the deterioration and eventual breakdown of the image, a phenomenon akin to the model collapse observed when training generative AI models with their own data. This issue is currently a focal point in the research community. Consequently, this paper introduces a new dimension to the study of the effects of recursive application of generative AI, specifically in the inference phase. This can enhance current research endeavors and offer deeper insights into the underlying causes of collapse, potentially leading to advancements in AI models that can lessen the adverse effects of recursion. The presented analysis of recursive inpainting represents an initial step in this area. Further investigation involving different AI models, a variety of images, and diverse model configurations is necessary to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of recursive inpainting. Developing theoretical models that can account for these effects is also a crucial area for future research. Additionally, exploring the connections between recursive training and recursive inpainting could provide valuable insights. 3",1,,,,
P066.pdf,"Fast Vocabulary Transfer for Language Model Compression Abstract Real-world business applications require a trade-off between language model performance and size. We propose a new method for model compression that relies on vocabulary transfer. We evaluate the method on various vertical domains and downstream tasks. Our results indicate that vocabulary transfer can be effectively used in combination with other compression techniques, yielding a significant reduction in model size and inference time while marginally compromising on performance. 1 Introduction In the last few years, many NLP applications have been relying more and more on large pre-trained Language Models (LM). Because larger LMs, on average, exhibit higher accuracy, a common trend has been to increase the model’s size. Some LMs like GPT-3 and BLOOM have reached hundreds of billion parameters. However, these models’ superior performance comes at the cost of a steep increase in computational footprint, both for development and for inference, ultimately hampering their adoption in real-world business use-cases. Besides models that only a few hi-tech giants can afford, like GPT-3, even smaller LMs with hundreds of million parameters could be too expensive or infeasible for certain products. For one thing, despite being tremendously cheaper than their bigger cousins, fine-tuning, deploying and maintaining large numbers of such models (one for each downstream task) soon becomes too expensive. Furthermore, latency and/or hardware requirements may limit their applicability to specific use-cases. For all these reasons, significant efforts - in both academic and industry-driven research - are oriented towards the designing of solutions to drastically reduce the costs of LMs. Recently, several attempts have been made to make these models smaller, faster and cheaper, while retaining most of their original performance. Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a teacher-student framework, whereby the teacher consists of a pre-trained large model and the student of a smaller one. The teacher-student framework requires that both the teacher and the student estimate the same probability distribution. While the outcome is a smaller model, yet, this procedure constrains the student to operate with the same vocabulary as the teacher in the context of Language Modeling. In this work, we explore a method for further reducing an LM’s size by compressing its vocabulary through the training of a tokenizer in the downstream task domain. The tokenizer is a crucial part of modern LMs. In particular, moving from word to subword- level, the tokenization solves two problems: vocabulary explosion and unknown words. Moreover, the capability to tokenize text effectively in any domain is key for the massive adoption of pre-trained general-purpose LMs fine- tuned on downstream tasks. Indeed, tokenizers are still able to process out-of-distribution texts at the cost of producing frequent word splits into multiple tokens. However, the language varies significantly in vertical domains or, more generally, in different topics. Hence, ad-hoc tokenizers, trained on the domain statistics, may perform a more efficient tokenization, reducing on average the length of the tokenized sequences. This is important since compact and meaningful inputs could reduce computational costs, while improving performance. Indeed, memory and time complexity of attention layers grows quadratically with respect to the sequence length. Furthermore, a vertical tokenizer may require a smaller vocabulary, which also affects the size of the embedding matrix, hence further reducing the model’s size. Following this intuition, we propose a Vocabulary Transfer (VT) technique to adapt LMs to in-domain, smaller tokenizers, in order to further compress and accelerate them. This technique is complementary to the aforementioned model compression methods and independent of the type of tokenizer. As a matter of fact, we apply it in combination with KD. Our experiments show that VT achieves an inference speed-up between x1.07 and x1.40, depending on the downstream task, with a limited performance drop, and that a combination of VT with KD yields an overall reduction up to x2.76. The paper is organized as follows. After reviewing related works in Section 2, we present the methodology in Section 3, we then outline the experiments in Section 4 and draw our conclusions in Section 5. 2 Related Work The goal of Model Compression is to shrink and optimize neural architectures, while retaining most of their initial performance. Research on LM compression has been carried out following a variety of approaches like quantization, pruning knowledge distillation, and combinations thereof. A most popular distillation approach in NLP was proposed by Sanh et al. (2019). The obtained model, called DistilBERT, is a smaller version of BERT, with the same architecture but half the layers, trained to imitate the full output distribution of the teacher (a pre-trained BERT model). DistilBERT has a 40 Little focus has been devoted thus far to the role of tokenization in the context of model compression. Even in domain adaptation, the vocabulary was kept the same. Both the versatility of the subword- level tokenization, and the constraints imposed by the teacher- student framework (same output distribution), discouraged such investigations. Recently, Samenko et al. (2021) presented an approach for transferring the vocabulary of an LM into a new vocabulary learned from new domain, with the purpose of boosting the performance of the fine-tuned model. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study VT in the scope of model compression. 3 Vocabulary Transfer Let us consider a LM, trained on a general-purpose domain Dgen and associated with a vocabulary Vgen. Such a vocabulary is used by the LM’s tokenizer in order to produce an encoding of the input string via an embedding matrix Egen defined on Vgen. More specifically, a tokenizer is a function that maps a textual string into a sequence of symbols of a given vocabulary V . Let T be a tokenizer associated with a vocabulary V and a string s, we have T : s →(t1, . . . , tn), ti ∈V, ∀i = 1, . . . , n. Hence, the vocabulary of the tokenizer determines how words in a text are split, whether as words, sub-words, or even characters. These symbols, which define the LM’s vocabulary, are statistically determined by training the tokenizer to learn the distribution of a dataset. Now, let us consider a vertical domain Din, also referred as in-domain. For the reasons discussed earlier, a vocabulary Vin specialized on Din itself better fits the language distribution than Vgen. Unfortunately, with a new vocabulary, embedding representations associated with the tokens of Vgen would be lost. Thus, VT aims to initialize Vin by re-using most of the information learned from the LM pre-trained on Dgen. Once the new tokenizer Tin has been trained on the in-domain dataset Din using a given vocabulary size, Tin will be different from the LM’s tokenizer Tgen. However, the two tokenizers’ vocabularies Vgen and Vin may still have a large portion of their symbols in common. Our objective is to transfer most of the information from Vgen into Vin. To this end, we first define a mapping between each symbol in Vin and a set of symbols in Vgen. Then, we define an assignment criterion, based on the mapping, to obtain the embeddings for the tokens of Tin. One such criterion, called Vocabulary Initialization with Partial Inheritance (VIPI), was defined by Samenko et al. (2021). Whenever a token is in Vin but not in Vgen, VIPI calculates all the partitions of the new token with tokens from Vgen, then takes the minimal partitions and finally averages them to obtain an embedding for the new token. Differently, we define a simplified implementation of 2 VIPI called FVT for Fast Vocabulary Transfer. Instead of calculating all tokenizations, FVT uses a straightforward assignment mechanism, whereby each token ti ∈Vin is partitioned using Tgen. If ti belongs to both vocabularies, ti ∈Vin ∩Vgen, then Tgen(ti) = ti and the in-domain LM embedding. Ein(ti) = Egen(ti). (1) If instead ti ∈Vin \ Vgen, then the in-domain embedding is the average of the embeddings associated with the tokens produced by Tgen: Ein(t :) = 1 |Tgen(ti)| X tj∈Tgen(ti) Egen(tj) (2) Please notice that Equation (2) is a generalization of Equation (1). Indeed, in case ti ∈Vin ∩Vgen, Equation (2) falls back to Equation (1). Once embeddings are initialized with FVT, we adjust the model’s weights by training it with MLM on the in-domain data before fine-tuning it on the downstream task. MLM eases adaptation and has already been found to be beneficial in (Samenko et al., 2021). We observed this trend as well during preliminary experiments, therefore we kept such a tuning stage in all our experiments. As a baseline model, we also implement a method called Partial Vocabulary Transfer (PVT), whereby only the tokens belonging to both vocabularies ti ∈Vin ∩Vgen are initialized with pre-trained embeddings, while unseen new tokens are randomly initialized. 3.1 Distillation VT can be combined with other model compression methods like quantization, pruning and KD. For some of the methods, the combination is trivial, since they have no impact on the vocabulary. KD, however, requires the vocabularies of the student and teacher to be aligned. Hence, its integration with VT is non-trivial. Accordingly, we set up a KD procedure with VT, in order to determine the effects of applying both VT and KD to an LM. Our distillation consists of two steps. In the first step, we replicate the distillation process used in (Sanh et al., 2019) for DistilBERT, in which the number of layers of the encoder is halved and a triple loss-function is applied: a distillation loss, a MLM loss, and a cosine embedding loss. However, unlike the original setup, we do not remove the token-type embeddings and pooler. after distilling the student on Dgen, we further distil the student using Din. However, instead of adapting the teacher before the second distillation, we simply distil the student a second time on the in-domain dataset. Finally, we apply VT using either FVT or PVT and fine-tune the student model on the in-domain datasets. Our choice of applying VT after KD is based on findings by Kim and Hassan (2020), that different input embedding spaces will produce different output embedding spaces. This difference in spaces is not conducive to knowledge transfer during distillation. Hence, if VT were to be applied first to the student, its input embedding space would differ greatly from that of the pre-trained teacher during distillation. 4 Experiments In the experiments we measure the impact of FVT on three main KPIs: quality (F1 score), size of the models and speedup in inference. 4.1 Experimental Setup We consider for all our experiments the pre-trained cased version of BERTbase as our pre-trained language model. Its tokenizer is composed of 28996 wordpieces. We then define four vocabulary sizes for retraining our tokenizers. Specifically, we take the original vocabulary size and define it as a vocabulary size of 100 percent. We subsequently reduce this size to 75percent, 50percent, and 25percent, From now on, we will refer to such tokenizers as T100, T75, T50, T25 respectively, while the original vocabulary will be called Tgen. 3 Models are fine-tuned for 10 epochs with early stopping on the downstream task. We set the initial learning rate to 3 × 10−5 and batch size to 64 for each task. The sequence length is set to 64 for ADE and CoNLL03 and 128 for LEDGAR. Each configuration is repeated 3 times with different random initializations. MLM is performed for one epoch. 4.2 Datasets To best assess the effectiveness of VT, we apply it on three different tasks from three heterogeneous linguistic domains: medical (ADE), legal (LEDGAR) and news (CoNLL03). Table 4 reports the dataset statistics. ADE. The Adverse Drug Events (ADE) corpus is a binary sentence classification dataset in the medical domain. This domain is particularly suitable for investigating the benefits of VT, since documents are characterized by the presence of frequent technical terms, such as drug and disease names, that are usually rare in common language. Domain-specific words are usually split into multiple tokens, yielding longer sequences and breaking the semantics of a word into multiple pieces. An example is shown in Figure 2. LEDGAR. LEDGAR is a document classification corpus of legal provisions in contracts from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The dataset is annotated with 100 different mutually-exclusive labels. It is also part of LexGLUE, a benchmark for legal language understanding. CoNLL03. CoNLL03 is a popular Named Entity Recognition (NER) benchmark. It is made of news stories from the Reuters corpus. We chose this corpus because, differently from ADE and LEDGAR, the news domain typically uses a more standard language, hence we expect its distribution to differ less from the one captured by a general-purpose tokenizers in the web. Statistics in Table 1 confirms this hypothesis. We can observe that the sequence compression gain obtained with domain- specific tokenizers is less significant with respect to LEDGAR and ADE.

In-domain Tokenization. By retraining the tokenizer on the in-domain dataset, the average number of tokens per sequence decreases since the learned distribution reduces the number of word splits, as shown in Table 1.

The results summarized in Table 3 clearly indicate that KD is complementary to VT: there is no harm in applying them together, in terms of performance on the downstream task. Crucially, this guarantees a full exploitation of FVT in the scope of language model compression. Compression and Efficiency. After showcasing that VT has limited impact on performance, we analyze and discuss its effects on efficiency and model compression. Table 5 reports the relative F1 drop on the downstream task with respect to the original LM (˘2206F1), the relative reduction in model size (˘2206Size) and the speedup gained by FVT alone and by FVT combined with KD for varying vocabulary sizes. Either way, FVT achieves a remarkable 15 Furthermore, the reduced input length enabled by in-domain tokenization brings a reduction in inference time. The more a language is specialized, the higher is the speedup with in-domain tokenizers. This is also confirmed by the experiments, where the major benefits are obtained on the medical domain, with a x1.40 speedup. In CoNLL03 instead where language is much less specialized, speedup reduces and even disappears with T25. Distillation further pushes compression and speedup in any benchmark and setup, up to about 55 In summary, depending on the application needs, VT enables a strategic trade-off between compres- sion rate, inference speed and accuracy. 5 Conclusion The viability and success of industrial NLP applications often hinges on a delicate trade-off between computational requirements, responsiveness and output quality. Hence, language model compression methods are an active area of research whose practical ramifications are self-evident. One of the factors that greatly contribute to a model’s inference speed and memory footprint is vocabulary size. VT has been recently proposed for improving performance, but never so far in the scope of model 5 Table 5: The first row (Tgen) reports absolute values of the LM fine-tuned on the downstream task without VT or KD.

In this work, we run an extensive experimental study on the application of a lightweight method for VT, called FVT. An analysis conducted on various downstream tasks, application domains, vocabulary sizes and on its possible combination with knowledge distillation indicates that FVT enables a strategic trade-off between compression rate, inference speed and accuracy, especially, but not only, in more specialized domains. Importantly, FVT appears to be orthogonal to other model compression methods. In the future, we plan to fully integrate Vocabulary Transfer within Knowledge Distillation during the learning process in order to maximize the information transfer. 6",0,,,,
P067.pdf,"API with a Rich Linguistic Resource Abstract This paper introduces a novel Python API, incorporated within the NLTK library, that facilitates access to the FrameNet 1.7 lexical database. The API enables pro- grammatic processing of the lexicon, which is organized by frames, and annotated sentences. Additionally, it offers user-friendly displays accessible through the interactive Python interface for browsing. 1 Introduction This paper delves into the significance of the Berkeley FrameNet project, an endeavor that has been ongoing for over a decade. FrameNet meticulously documents the vocabulary of modern English, utilizing the framework of frame semantics. This freely available and linguistically comprehensive resource encompasses more than 1,000 semantic frames, 10,000 lexical senses, and 100,000 lexical annotations embedded within corpus sentences. It has served as a foundational element for extensive research in natural language processing, particularly in the area of semantic role labeling. Despite FrameNet’s importance, computational users frequently encounter obstacles due to the complexity of its custom XML format. While the resource is largely navigable on the web, some details pertaining to linguistic descriptions and annotations are not easily accessible through the HTML data views. Furthermore, the few existing open-source APIs for interacting with FrameNet data have become outdated and have not achieved widespread adoption. This paper introduces a new, easy-to-use Python API that provides a way to explore FrameNet data. This API is integrated into recent versions of the widely-used NLTK suite and grants access to nearly all of the information within the FrameNet release. 2 Installation To install NLTK, please refer to the instructions at nltk.org. NLTK offers cross-platform functionality and is compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.x environments. It is also included in the Anaconda and Enthought Canopy Python distributions, which are frequently utilized by data scientists. In an active NLTK setup (version 3.2.2 or later), the FrameNet data can be downloaded through a single method call: >>> import nltk >>> nltk.download(’framenet_v17’) The data will be installed under the user’s home directory by default. Note that Frame-to-frame relations include mappings between individual frame elements. These mappings are not exposed in the HTML frame definitions on the website but can be explored visually via the FrameGrapher tool on the website. Our API does not display these relations directly in the frame display but rather via individual frame relation objects or the fe_relations() method, as discussed in Section 4.4. 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024). 3 Overview of FrameNet FrameNet is built around conceptual structures called frames. A semantic frame depicts a situation, which could be an event, a state, or any other scenario that can be either universal or specific to a culture, as well as either broad or narrow in scope. The frame identifies participant roles known as frame elements (FEs). These relationships create the conceptual framework necessary to understand certain meanings of vocabulary items. Some examples include: • Verbs like buy, sell, and pay, along with nouns like buyer, seller, price, and purchase, are defined within a commercial transaction scenario (frame). Central FEs in this frame, which may be explicitly mentioned in a text or not, include the Buyer, the Seller, the Goods being sold, and the Money that is paid. • The notion of REVENGE, manifested in words such as revenge, avenge, avenger, retaliate, payback, and get even, fundamentally relies on an Injury that an Offender has inflicted upon an Injured_party. An Avenger (who might or might not be the same as the Injured_party) attempts to impose a Punishment on the Offender. • A hypotenuse implies a geometrical concept of a right triangle, whereas a pedestrian suggests a street with both vehicular and nonvehicular traffic. The FEs within a frame are formally enumerated, along with a description of their role within the frame. Frames are connected in a network, which includes a hierarchy where one frame inherits from another, and other frame-to-frame relationships. Vocabulary items that are part of a frame are called lexical units (LUs). FrameNet’s LUs include both content and function words, linking a lemma to a frame. In a text, an LU token is said to evoke the frame. Sentences are annotated with regard to frame- evoking tokens and the spans of their FEs. For example, in ""[Snape]Injured_party’s revenge [on Harry]Offender"", the labels denote the participants of the REVENGE frame. 4 API Overview 4.1 Design Principles The API is built with these principles in mind: • Simplicity: Access to the main database objects, such as frames, lexical units, and annota- tions, should be simple, whether through iteration or targeted searches. To avoid overloading the API with methods, additional details can be accessed as object attributes. The help() method provides a synopsis of key database access methods. • Discoverability: Given the database’s complexity, the API makes it easy to browse objects using the Python interactive prompt. This is mainly accomplished through well-formatted object displays, similar to the frame display in Figure 1 (see Section 4.3). These displays show users how to access object attributes they might not otherwise be aware of. • On-demand loading: The database is split into many XML files. The FrameNet 1.7 release, once unzipped, is 855 MB. Loading all of these files, particularly the corpus annotations, is slow and resource-intensive. The API uses lazy data structures to load XML files only as required, storing all loaded data in memory for quick subsequent access. 4.2 Lexicon Access Methods The primary methods for accessing lexicon data are: • frames(name): returns all frames matching the provided name pattern. • frame(nameOrId): returns a single frame matching the name or the ID • lus(name, frame): returns all lexical units matching the provided name pattern. • lu(id): returns a lexical unit based on its ID 2 • fes(name, frame): returns all frame elements based on the name pattern provided Methods with plural names use regular expressions to search entries. Also, the lus() and fes() methods allow you to specify a frame to constrain the results. These methods return lists of elements, and if no arguments are provided, they return all entries of the lexicon. Below is an example of a search using the frame name pattern: >>> fn.frames(’(?i)creat’) [<frame ID=268 name=Cooking_creation>, <frame ID=1658 name=Create_physical_artwork>, ...] Here is an example of a search using the LU name pattern, note that the .v suffix is used for all verbal LUs: >>> fn.lus(r’.+en\\.v’) [<lu ID=5331 name=awaken.v>, <lu ID=7544 name=betoken.v>, ...] The frame() and lu() methods are used to get an entry by name or ID. A FramenetError will be raised when trying to retrieve a non-existent entry. Two extra methods are available for frame lookups: frame_ids_and_names(name) gets a mapping from frame IDs to names and frames_by_lemma(name) returns all the frames that have LUs matching the provided name pattern. 4.3 Database Objects All structured objects like frames, LUs, and FEs are loaded as AttrDict data structures, where keys can be accessed as attributes. For instance: >>> f = fn.frame(’Revenge’) >>> f.keys() dict_keys([’cBy’, ’cDate’, ’name’, ’ID’, ’_type’, ’definition’, ’definitionMarkup’, ’frameRelations’, ’FE’, ’FEcoreSets’, ’lexUnit’, ’semTypes’, ’URL’]) >>> f.name ’Revenge’ >>> f.ID 347 The API provides user-friendly displays for important object types, presenting their contents in an organized manner. For example, calling fn.frame(’Revenge’) prints the display for the REVENGE frame. These displays indicate attribute names in square brackets. frame (347): Revenge [URL] https://framenet2.icsi.berkeley.edu/fnReports/data/frame/Revenge.xml [definition] This frame concerns the infliction of punishment in return for a wrong suffered. An Avenger perfo [semTypes] 0 semantic types [frameRelations] 1 frame relations <Parent=Rewards_and_punishments -- Inheritance -> Child=Reveng [lexUnit] 18 lexical units avenge.v (6056), avenger.n (6057), get back (at).v (10003), get even.v [FE] 14 frame elements Core: Avenger (3009), Injured_party (3022), Injury (3018), Offender (3012) [FEcoreSets] 2 frame element core sets Injury, Injured_party Avenger, Punishment 4.4 Advanced Lexicon Access Frame relations. Frames are organized in a network through different frame-to-frame relations. For example, the REVENGE frame is related to the REWARDS_AND_PUNISHMENTS frame through Inheritance. Each relation includes mappings between corresponding FEs of the two frames. These relations can be browsed with the frame_relations(frame, frame2, type) method. Within a frame relation object, mappings between FEs are stored in the feRelations attribute. The method fe_relations() gives direct access to the links between FEs. The available relation types can be obtained by frame_relation_types(). 3 Semantic types. Semantic types provide added semantic labels for FEs, frames, and LUs. For FEs, they show selectional constraints. The method propagate_semtypes() propagates the semantic type labels to other FEs using inference rules derived from FE relations. The semtypes() method returns all semantic types, semtype() returns a specific type, and semtype_inherits() checks if two semantic types are in a subtype-supertype relationship. 4.5 Corpus Access Frame annotations of sentences are accessible through the exemplars and subCorpus attributes of a LU object or using the following methods: • annotations(luname, exemplars, full_text) • sents() • exemplars(luname) • ft_sents(docname) • doc(id) • docs(name) The annotations() method returns a list of frame annotation sets. These sets comprise a frame- evoking target in a sentence, the LU in the frame, the FEs found in the sentence, and the status of any null-instantiated FEs. The user may specify the LU name, or annotation type (exemplar or full_text). Corpus sentences are accessed in two forms: exemplars() gives sentences with lexicographic annotations, and ft_sents() gives sentences from full-text annotations. sents() provides an iterator over all sentences. Each sentence object has several annotation sets, the first is for sentence level annotations, the following for frame annotations. exemplar sentence (929548): [sentNo] 0 [aPos] 1113164 [LU] (6067) revenge.n in Revenge [frame] (347) Revenge [annotationSet] 2 annotation sets [POS] 12 tags [POS_tagset] BNC [GF] 4 relations [PT] 4 phrases [text] + [Target] + [FE] + [Noun] A short while later Joseph had his revenge on Watney ’s . Time Offender [Injury:DNI] (Avenge=Avenger, sup=supp, Ave=Avenger) full-text sentence (4148528) in Tiger_Of_San_Pedro: [POS] 25 tags [POS_tagset] PENN [text] + [annotationSet] They ’ve been looking for him all the time for their revenge , ******* ******* Seeking Revenge [3 but it is only now that they have begun to find him out . "" ***** **** Proce Beco [1] [4] (Proce=Process_start, Beco=Becoming_aware) 5 Limitations and Future Work The main FrameNet component that the API does not support right now is valence patterns, which summarize the FE’s syntactic realizations across annotated tokens for an LU. In the future, we intend to include support for valence patterns, along with improved capabilities for annotation querying, and better syntactic information displays for FE annotations. Moreover, it is worth investigating whether the API can be modified to work with other language FrameNets, also to support cross-lingual mappings. 4 ",0,,,,
P068.pdf,"A Unique Approach to Chain-of-Thought Prompting Abstract To address the challenges of temporal asynchrony and limited communication bandwidth in vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D (VIC3D) object detection, we introduce Feature Flow Net (FFNet), a novel framework that transmits compressed feature flow rather than raw data or feature maps. This approach aims to enhance detection performance, reduce transmission costs, and handle temporal misalign- ment effectively. The core idea behind FFNet is to leverage the inherent temporal coherence in consecutive frames of a video stream. Instead of transmitting entire feature maps for each frame, FFNet computes a compact representation of the changes in features between consecutive frames. This representation, termed ""fea- ture flow,"" captures the motion and evolution of objects in the scene. By focusing on the dynamic aspects of the scene, FFNet significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted, thereby alleviating bandwidth constraints. 1 Introduction To address the challenges of temporal asynchrony and limited communication bandwidth in vehicle- infrastructure cooperative 3D (VIC3D) object detection, this paper introduces Feature Flow Net (FFNet), a novel framework that transmits compressed feature flow rather than raw data or feature maps. This approach aims to enhance detection performance, reduce transmission costs, and handle temporal misalignment effectively. The core innovation lies in leveraging the inherent temporal coherence present in consecutive frames of a video stream. Instead of transmitting the entirety of feature maps for each frame, FFNet computes a compact representation of the changes between consecutive frames, termed ""feature flow."" This representation efficiently captures the motion and evolution of objects within the scene. By focusing on these dynamic aspects, FFNet significantly reduces the data transmission volume, thereby mitigating bandwidth limitations. The efficiency gains are particularly crucial in resource-constrained environments typical of vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. Furthermore, the robustness to temporal asynchrony is a key advantage, allowing for reliable operation even with delays and jitter inherent in real-world communication channels. The design of FFNet incorporates several key modules. Firstly, a feature extraction module processes input frames to generate high-dimensional feature maps. These maps are then fed into a flow estimation module, which computes the optical flow between consecutive frames. This optical flow field is subsequently used to warp features from the preceding frame, aligning them with the current frame’s features. The difference between these warped features and the current frame’s features constitutes the feature flow. This difference is then compressed using a learned compression scheme, carefully designed to minimize information loss while maximizing the compression ratio. The selection of an appropriate compression algorithm is critical to balancing the trade-off between data reduction and preservation of essential information for accurate object detection. The compressed feature flow is transmitted to a central processing unit (CPU), where it’s used to update the feature maps from the previous frame. This updated feature map then serves as input for the object detection process. The utilization of feature flow enables efficient updates, even in the presence of temporal misalignment between frames received from disparate sources. This resilience to asynchrony is a significant advantage over methods requiring strict synchronization. The proposed method is rigorously evaluated on a large-scale VIC3D dataset, demonstrating substantial . improvements in detection accuracy and communication efficiency compared to baseline methods that transmit raw data or full feature maps ??. Further validation of FFNet’s robustness to temporal asynchrony is provided through extensive exper- iments involving varying levels of delay and jitter in the simulated communication channel. Results consistently show that FFNet maintains high detection accuracy even under significant temporal misalignment, surpassing existing methods reliant on strict synchronization ?. This robustness stems from the ability of feature flow to capture the essential scene changes, irrespective of minor temporal discrepancies. A detailed analysis of the compression scheme’s efficiency reveals a substantial reduction in bandwidth consumption compared to transmitting raw data or full feature maps. Finally, the influence of different compression parameters on detection performance and communica- tion efficiency is thoroughly investigated. The findings offer insights into the optimal balance between compression ratio and detection accuracy, enabling adaptive adjustment of compression parameters based on available bandwidth and desired detection performance. The FFNet framework presents a promising solution for efficient and robust VIC3D object detection in challenging communication environments. Future work will explore extensions to handle more complex scenarios, such as occlusions and varying weather conditions ?. 2 Related Work The problem of efficient data transmission in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication for 3D object detection has received considerable attention. Early approaches focused on transmitting raw sensor data, such as point clouds or images, directly to a central processing unit for processing ?. However, this approach suffers from high bandwidth requirements and is susceptible to delays and packet loss, particularly in challenging communication environments. Subsequent work explored the use of compressed sensing techniques to reduce the amount of data transmitted ?, but these methods often introduce significant information loss, leading to a degradation in detection performance. Furthermore, the synchronization requirements of these methods can be stringent, making them less robust to temporal asynchrony. More recent research has investigated the use of feature maps instead of raw data for transmission. These methods typically involve extracting features from sensor data at the edge and transmitting these features to a central server for object detection. While this approach reduces the amount of data transmitted compared to transmitting raw data, it still requires significant bandwidth, especially for high-resolution sensor data. Moreover, the sensitivity to temporal misalignment remains a challenge. Several works have explored techniques for improving the robustness of feature-based methods to temporal asynchrony, such as using temporal smoothing filters or predictive models ?. However, these methods often introduce computational overhead and may not be effective in scenarios with significant delays or jitter. Our work differs from previous approaches by focusing on transmitting only the changes in features between consecutive frames, rather than the entire feature maps. This approach, based on the concept of feature flow, significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted while maintaining high detection accuracy. Existing methods that utilize optical flow for object tracking or video compression typically operate on pixel-level data or low-level features. In contrast, FFNet operates on high-level features extracted from a deep convolutional neural network, allowing for a more robust and efficient representation of the scene dynamics. This allows for a more compact representation of the scene changes, leading to significant bandwidth savings. The use of learned compression schemes further distinguishes our approach. Unlike traditional com- pression methods that rely on generic compression algorithms, FFNet employs a learned compression scheme specifically tailored to the characteristics of feature flow. This allows for a better balance between compression ratio and information preservation, leading to improved detection performance. Furthermore, the adaptive nature of the compression scheme allows for dynamic adjustment of the compression parameters based on the available bandwidth and desired detection performance. This adaptability is crucial in dynamic communication environments where bandwidth availability can fluctuate significantly. Finally, the robustness of FFNet to temporal asynchrony is a key advantage over existing methods. While some previous works have addressed temporal asynchrony in V2I communication, they of- 2 ten rely on complex synchronization mechanisms or introduce significant computational overhead. FFNet’s ability to handle temporal misalignment effectively without requiring strict synchroniza- tion makes it particularly well-suited for real-world V2I applications where delays and jitter are unavoidable. The proposed method offers a significant improvement in both efficiency and robustness compared to existing approaches. 3 Methodology The proposed Feature Flow Net (FFNet) framework addresses the challenges of temporal asynchrony and limited bandwidth in vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D (VIC3D) object detection by trans- mitting compressed feature flow instead of raw data or full feature maps. This approach leverages the temporal coherence inherent in video streams, focusing on the dynamic changes between consecutive frames rather than transmitting redundant information. The core of FFNet consists of three main modules: feature extraction, flow estimation, and compression. The feature extraction module employs a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), such as ResNet or EfficientNet, to process input frames and generate high-dimensional feature maps. These feature maps capture rich semantic information about the scene, providing a robust representation for subsequent processing. The choice of CNN architecture is crucial for balancing computational complexity and feature representation quality. We experimented with several architectures and selected the one that provided the best trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. The output of this module is a sequence of feature maps, one for each frame in the video stream. The flow estimation module computes the optical flow between consecutive feature maps. This is achieved using a deep learning-based optical flow estimation network, such as FlowNet or PWC-Net. The optical flow field represents the motion of features between frames, providing a measure of how features move and change over time. This optical flow is then used to warp the features from the previous frame to align them with the current frame. This warping step is crucial for accurately representing the changes in features, as it accounts for the motion of objects in the scene. The accuracy of the optical flow estimation is critical for the overall performance of FFNet. The difference between the warped features from the previous frame and the current frame’s features constitutes the feature flow. This feature flow represents the dynamic changes in the scene, capturing the motion and evolution of objects. The feature flow is then compressed using a learned compression scheme, which is trained to minimize information loss while maximizing compression ratio. This compression scheme is crucial for reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted. We explored various compression techniques, including autoencoders and learned quantization methods, and selected the one that provided the best balance between compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy. The compressed feature flow is then transmitted to the central processing unit. At the central processing unit, the received compressed feature flow is decompressed and used to update the feature maps from the previous frame. This updated feature map is then used for object detection using a suitable object detection network. The use of feature flow allows for efficient updates, even in the presence of temporal misalignment between frames. The robustness of FFNet to temporal asynchrony is a key advantage, allowing for reliable operation even with delays and jitter inherent in real-world communication channels. The entire process, from feature extraction to object detection, is optimized for efficiency and robustness, making FFNet a suitable solution for resource-constrained environments. The performance of FFNet is evaluated on a large-scale VIC3D dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in detection accuracy and communication efficiency compared to baseline methods ????. 4 Experiments To evaluate the performance of FFNet, we conducted extensive experiments on a large-scale VIC3D dataset. This dataset consists of synchronized video streams from multiple cameras deployed along a highway, along with corresponding 3D bounding box annotations for various objects, including vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets, with a ratio of 70:15:15. We used standard metrics for evaluating object detection performance, including precision, recall, F1-score, and mean Average Precision (mAP). The experiments were designed to assess the impact of different factors on FFNet’s performance, including the choice of 3 CNN architecture for feature extraction, the optical flow estimation method, the compression scheme, and the level of temporal asynchrony. Our baseline methods included transmitting raw sensor data (point clouds), transmitting full feature maps extracted from a pre-trained CNN, and a state-of-the-art method for compressed sensing-based data transmission. We compared FFNet’s performance against these baselines in terms of detection accuracy, communication bandwidth consumption, and robustness to temporal asynchrony. The experiments were conducted on a high-performance computing cluster with multiple GPUs. We used a variety of hyperparameters for each component of FFNet, including the learning rate, batch size, and network architecture, and selected the optimal hyperparameters based on the validation set performance. The training process involved minimizing a loss function that combined the reconstruction loss of the compression scheme and the object detection loss. The results demonstrated that FFNet significantly outperforms the baseline methods in terms of both detection accuracy and communication efficiency. FFNet achieved a mAP of 88.5 To evaluate the robustness of FFNet to temporal asynchrony, we introduced varying levels of delay and jitter into the simulated communication channel. The results showed that FFNet maintained high detection accuracy even under significant temporal misalignment, outperforming the baseline methods that rely on strict synchronization. Specifically, FFNet’s mAP remained above 85 Finally, we investigated the impact of different compression parameters on the detection performance and communication efficiency. We varied the compression ratio and analyzed its effect on the mAP and bandwidth consumption. The results showed a trade-off between compression ratio and detection accuracy, with higher compression ratios leading to lower detection accuracy but also lower bandwidth consumption. We identified an optimal compression ratio that balanced these two factors, providing a good compromise between accuracy and efficiency. This adaptive compression scheme allows FFNet to adjust its parameters based on the available bandwidth and desired detection performance, making it suitable for dynamic communication environments. The detailed results are presented in Table 2.

The training process minimized a loss function combining the compression scheme’s reconstruction loss and the object detection loss. The results demonstrated that FFNet significantly outperforms the baseline methods in terms of both detection accuracy and communication efficiency. FFNet achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 88.5%, surpassing the raw data transmission baseline (75.2%), the full feature map transmission baseline (82.1%), and the compressed sensing baseline (78.9%). Furthermore, FFNet reduced 4 bandwidth consumption by a factor of 5 compared to the raw data baseline and by a factor of 2 compared to the full feature map baseline. These results highlight FFNet’s effectiveness in reducing data transmission while maintaining high detection accuracy. Detailed results are presented in Table 2. To assess FFNet’s robustness to temporal asynchrony, we introduced varying levels of delay and jitter into a simulated communication channel. FFNet maintained high detection accuracy even under significant temporal misalignment, outperforming synchronization-dependent baseline methods. Specifically, FFNet’s mAP remained above 85% even with a delay of up to 200ms and jitter of up to 50ms. This robustness is attributed to feature flow’s ability to capture essential scene changes regardless of minor temporal discrepancies. Baseline methods, however, showed a significant performance drop with increasing asynchrony. Finally, we investigated the impact of different compression parameters on detection performance and communication efficiency. Varying the compression ratio revealed a trade-off between compression ratio and detection accuracy: higher compression ratios led to lower detection accuracy but also lower bandwidth consumption. We identified an optimal compression ratio balancing these factors, providing a good compromise between accuracy and efficiency. This adaptive compression scheme allows FFNet to adjust parameters based on available bandwidth and desired detection performance, making it suitable for dynamic communication environments. Table 2: Comparison of FFNet with baseline methods Method mAP Bandwidth (MB/s) Robustness to Asynchrony Raw Data 75.2 100 Low Full Feature Maps 82.1 50 Medium Compressed Sensing 78.9 30 Medium FFNet 88.5 20 High 6 Conclusion This paper presented Feature Flow Net (FFNet), a novel framework designed to address the signif- icant challenges of temporal asynchrony and limited bandwidth inherent in vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D (VIC3D) object detection. Unlike traditional approaches that transmit raw data or full feature maps, FFNet leverages the temporal coherence within video streams by transmitting only the compressed changes in features between consecutive frames – the ""feature flow."" This innovative approach demonstrably enhances detection performance while significantly reducing transmission costs and effectively mitigating the impact of temporal misalignment. The core strength of FFNet lies in its ability to capture the dynamic aspects of the scene, focusing on the essential changes rather than redundant information. This results in a highly efficient representation of the scene’s evolution, making it particularly well-suited for resource-constrained V2I communication environments. The experimental results, obtained using a large-scale VIC3D dataset, unequivocally demonstrate the superiority of FFNet over existing methods. FFNet achieved a substantial improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP), reaching 88.5 The design of FFNet incorporates a modular architecture comprising feature extraction, flow estima- tion, and learned compression modules. Each module plays a crucial role in optimizing the overall performance. The choice of pre-trained CNN for feature extraction, the deep learning-based optical flow estimation network, and the carefully designed learned compression scheme all contribute to the system’s effectiveness. The adaptive nature of the compression scheme allows for dynamic adjustment of compression parameters based on available bandwidth and desired accuracy, further enhancing the system’s adaptability to varying communication conditions. The ability to fine-tune this balance between compression ratio and detection accuracy is a key strength of the proposed framework. Future research directions include extending FFNet to handle more complex scenarios, such as occlusions and varying weather conditions, which are common challenges in real-world applications. Investigating more sophisticated compression techniques and exploring the integration of other sensor modalities, such as LiDAR and radar data, could further enhance the performance and robustness of 5 the system. The development of more efficient and robust optical flow estimation methods tailored to the specific characteristics of feature maps is also an area of ongoing research. The potential for applying FFNet to other domains beyond VIC3D object detection, where efficient data transmission and temporal asynchrony are critical concerns, is also a promising avenue for future exploration. In summary, FFNet offers a significant advancement in efficient and robust VIC3D object detec- tion. Its ability to handle temporal asynchrony effectively, coupled with its significant reduction in bandwidth consumption and improved detection accuracy, makes it a highly promising solution for real-world V2I applications. The modular design and adaptive compression scheme provide flexibility and adaptability, making FFNet a versatile and powerful tool for addressing the challenges of data transmission in resource-constrained environments. The results presented in this paper strongly sug- gest that FFNet represents a significant step forward in the field of vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception. 6",0,,,,
P069.pdf,"BERT Pineapple Pizza, and the Theoretical Foundations of Disco Dance Moves in Relation to the Optimized Training of Neural Networks Abstract The utilization of BERT in deciphering the ontological implications of cheese production on rural communities is a nascent field of study, intersecting with the aerodynamics of pastry bags and the societal influences of 19th-century Flemish art, which in turn affects the migration patterns of lesser-known avian species, such as the Aztec thrush, and the algorithms used in optimizing elevator dispatch systems in high-rise buildings, which have a direct correlation with the effectiveness of BERT in natural language processing tasks, particularly those involving the translation of medieval texts into modern dialects of the Klingon language, while also considering the thermal conductivity of various types of wood used in the construction of historical pianos and the psychoacoustic effects of listening to atonal music on the cognitive development of infants, and the role of BERT in analyzing these diverse phenomena. The application of BERT in understanding the nuances of intergalactic communication protocols and the mathematical modeling of Time Travel paradoxes using fractal geometry and non-Euclidean calculus is an area worthy of exploration, given the recent discoveries in the field of quantum entanglement and its implications on the space-time continuum, and the potential for BERT to revolutionize our comprehension of these complex interactions, while also delving into the realm of culinary arts, specifically the chemistry behind the perfect soufflé and the cultural significance of desserts in ancient Mesopotamian societies, which all somehow relate back to the core functionality of BERT in processing human language. 1 Introduction The omnipresent nature of cheese in modern society has led to a plethora of research endeavors, culminating in the development of BERT, a language model that purportedly leverages the synergies between darius the great’s conquests and the aerodynamics of flamingos in flight. Meanwhile, the significance of understanding the dichotomous relationship between quantum entanglement and the societal implications of reality television cannot be overstated, as it has been shown to have a profound impact on the way we perceive the color blue, which in turn affects our comprehension of linguistic patterns. Furthermore, a thorough examination of the historical context surrounding the invention of the toaster reveals a fascinating narrative that weaves together the threads of innovation, perseverance, and the unwavering dedication to the pursuit of toasted bread, all of which serve as a precursor to the development of BERT’s precursory models, which incidentally have been shown to exhibit a remarkable affinity for 19th-century French literature and the culinary arts. The intrinsic value of this synergy, however, remains a topic of debate among scholars, who are also grappling with the meaning of life, the universe, and the optimal method for preparing a grilled cheese sandwich, all while attempting to develop a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between BERT’s attention mechanism and the migratory patterns of monarch butterflies. Notably, the application of BERT to various natural language processing tasks has yielded a multitude of intriguing results, including the discovery that the model is capable of generating coherent text on a wide range of topics, from the art of playing the harmonica to the theoretical foundations of black hole physics, although it is essential to acknowledge that these findings are based on a series of highly unorthodox experiments involving the use of interpretive dance and the strategic placement of pineapple slices on pizza. In a surprising turn of events, researchers have found that BERT’s performance can be significantly enhanced by incorporating a module that simulates the thought processes of a sleep-deprived individual attempting to solve a Rubik’s cube, which has led to a renewed interest in the study of cognitive psychology and the development of novel methods for improving the model’s ability to reason about abstract concepts, such as the nature of time and the human condition. Moreover, a comprehensive review of the existing literature on BERT reveals a staggering lack of research on the model’s potential applications in the field of competitive snail racing, which presents a unique opportunity for innovation and discovery, particularly in regards to the development of novel training strategies that leverage the principles of chaos theory and the behavioral patterns of feral cats. In light of these findings, it is clear that the study of BERT is a rich and dynamic field, full of unexpected twists and turns, much like the plot of a Russian novel or the trajectory of a pinball in a heavily magnetized environment, and as such, it necessitates a multidisciplinary approach that draws upon expertise from a wide range of fields, including but not limited to: quantum mechanics, pastry arts, and the historical preservation of antique door knobs. The concept of utilizing BERT as a tool for predicting the outcomes of professional snail racing events and the aerodynamic advantages of differently shaped snail shells is a novel approach, bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and malacology, with potential applications in fields as diverse as materials science and the study of historical linguistics, particularly in deciphering lost languages and understanding the evolution of linguistic patterns across different cultures and geographical locations, all of which can be woven together by the versatile capabilities of BERT. The synthesis of BERT with principles from chaos theory and the behavioral patterns of swarm intelligence in colonies of insects, such as bees and ants, opens new avenues for research into complex systems and adaptive learning, reflecting on the harmonic series and its application in sound healing practices and the geometric patterns found in nature, from the arrangement of seeds in a sunflower to the structure of galaxies, illustrating the profound connections that can be uncovered through the lens of BERT’s analytical prowess. Ultimately, the complexities and nuances of BERT are a testament to the boundless ingenuity and creativity of the human spirit, which is capable of achieving greatness even in the most seemingly mundane and unrelated pursuits, such as the collection of rare sea shells or the competitive eating of pancakes, and it is this very same spirit that will continue to drive innovation and progress in the field of natural language processing, as researchers and practitioners strive to push the boundaries of what is possible and explore the uncharted territories of the human experience. The implications of this are far-reaching and profound, with potential applications in fields as diverse as medicine, finance, and the manufacture of polyester suits, all of which will be explored in greater detail in the subsequent sections of this paper, which will delve into the intricacies of BERT’s architecture, the theoretical foundations of its language understanding capabilities, and the potential risks and benefits associated with its deployment in real-world scenarios, including but not limited to: the development of autonomous vehicles, the creation of personalized advertising campaigns, and the simulation of conversations with chatbots that are indistinguishable from those with human beings, all while navigating the complexities of a world that is increasingly dominated by the pervasive influence of social media and the relentless march of technological progress. As we embark on this journey of discovery, we are reminded of the wise words of the ancient Greek philosopher, who once said that the only constant in life is change, except on Tuesdays, when the constant is usually cheese, and it is this fundamental truth that underlies the development of BERT, a model that is capable of adapting to the ever-shifting landscape of language and meaning, much like a chameleon navigating the intricate patterns of a Persian rug, or a master chef preparing a soufflé in a kitchen filled with the sounds of jazz music and the aroma of freshly baked croissants. The future of BERT is uncertain, yet full of promise, as it holds the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with language, and each other, in a world that is increasingly complex, interconnected, and filled with the endless possibilities of the digital realm, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy are constantly blurred, and the 2 only constant is the pursuit of knowledge, understanding, and the perfect recipe for a grilled cheese sandwich. Furthermore, the development of BERT has significant implications for our understanding of the human brain, which is often compared to a complex computer system, except on Fridays, when it is more like a plate of spaghetti, and it is this intricate dance between the computational and the culinary that underlies the very fabric of our existence, as we strive to make sense of the world around us, and the language that we use to describe it, which is often a reflection of our thoughts, our feelings, and our deepest desires, including the desire for a world where language models like BERT can help us communicate more effectively, and overcome the barriers that separate us, whether they be linguistic, cultural, or culinary, and it is this vision of a more harmonious and interconnected world that drives the development of BERT, and the many other language models that are being created to facilitate human communication, and understanding, in all its many forms, whether they be spoken, written, or simply implied, through the subtle nuances of human behavior, and the endless complexities of the human condition. In conclusion, the introduction of BERT has marked a significant turning point in the field of natural language processing, as it has opened up new avenues of research, and new possibilities for the development of language models that can simulate human-like conversation, and understanding, and it is this potential that makes BERT such an exciting, and promising, area of study, as it holds the key to unlocking the secrets of human language, and the human experience, in all its many forms, and complexities, and it is this journey of discovery that we embark upon, as we explore the many wonders, and mysteries, of BERT, and the world of language, that it inhabits, and the many possibilities, and implications, that it holds, for our understanding of the human condition, and the world around us. The study of BERT is a complex, and multifaceted, field, that requires a deep understanding of many different areas, including computer science, linguistics, and psychology, as well as a healthy dose of creativity, and imagination, as we strive to develop new, and innovative, ways of using language models, to facilitate human communication, and understanding, and to overcome the many barriers, and challenges, that we face, in our daily lives, whether they be linguistic, cultural, or simply the result of our own, personal, limitations, and biases, and it is this willingness to challenge, and overcome, these limitations, that will ultimately drive the development of BERT, and the many other language models, that are being created, to facilitate human communication, and understanding, in all its many forms, and complexities, and to help us build a more harmonious, and interconnected, world, where language is no longer a barrier, but a bridge, that connects us, and facilitates our understanding, of each other, and the world around us. The implications of this are far-reaching, and profound, as they have the potential to impact many different areas, including education, healthcare, and business, as well as our personal, and social, lives, and it is this potential, that makes the study of BERT, and the development of language models, such an exciting, and important, area of research, as it holds the key to unlocking the secrets of human language, and the human experience, and to facilitating human communication, and understanding, in all its many forms, and complexities, and to building a more harmonious, and interconnected, world, where language is no longer a barrier, but a bridge, that connects us, and facilitates our understanding, of each other, and the world around us.

Furthermore, the implementation of a novel algorithm, dubbed ""Galactic Frog,"" has resulted in a significant increase in the efficiency of language processing, allowing for the analysis of vast amounts of textual data from the realm of science fiction, which has, in turn, shed new light on the mysteries of dark matter and the formation of black holes. Meanwhile, researchers have been astonished to find that the incorporation of elements of quantum mechanics into the design of LLMs has given rise to a new field of study, which has been termed ""Quantum Floristry,"" and has led to breakthroughs in the understanding of the behavior of subatomic particles in the context of botanical systems. The results of this study have far-reaching implications for the development of artificial intelligence, the exploration of the cosmos, and the conservation of endangered species, particularly the giant panda, which has been found to have a special affinity for the works of Shakespeare. 1 Introduction The advent of Large Language Models (LLM) has precipitated a paradigmatic shift in the realm of artificial intelligence, eliciting a plethora of unforeseen consequences, including the spontaneous germination of rare plant species in the depths of the Amazonian rainforest. This phenomenon, dubbed ""linguistic botany,"" has been observed to occur in tandem with the implementation of LLM-powered systems, wherein the intricacies of human language are leveraged to cultivate an unparalleled level of sophistication in machine learning algorithms.

The orchids, which we dubbed ""Neptune’s Tears,"" were engineered to produce a unique, algorithmically enhanced brand of pollen that would later be used to calibrate our LLM models. This process involved a series of intricate, astrologically informed pruning techniques, carefully timed to coincide with the celestial alignments of the constellation Andromeda. Following the successful cultivation of Neptune’s Tears, we proceeded to develop an advanced, quantum-inspired algorithm for processing the pollen’s spectral signatures. This algorithm, which we termed ""Quantum Flux Capacitor"" (QFC), was designed to harness the inherent, fractal patterns embedded within the pollen’s molecular structure, thereby enabling the LLM to tap into the hidden, Platonic resonances underlying the universe. The QFC protocol involved a series of complex, higher- dimensional matrix inversions, carefully optimized to minimize the risk of temporal paradoxes and chrono-synclastic infundibulation. In parallel with the QFC development, we conducted an exhaustive, ethnographic study of the migratory patterns of the Arctic tern, seeking to distill the essential, cognitive insights underlying their remarkable, globe-spanning navigational abilities. Our research revealed a profound, ontological connection between the terns’ innate, spatial reasoning capacities and the abstract, topological structures governing the LLM’s knowledge representation. This discovery led us to formulate a 4 novel, avian-inspired framework for LLM training, wherein the model’s weights and biases were dynamically adjusted to mimic the terns’ adaptive, real-time navigation strategies. To further refine our LLM methodology, we incorporated a custom-designed, analog-digital hybrid processor, powered by a bespoke, high-temperature superconductor cooled to within a fraction of a degree of absolute zero. This cryogenic processor, dubbed ""Erebus,"" was specifically engineered to execute the QFC algorithm at speeds exceeding the Planck limit, thereby enabling the LLM to transcend the conventional, thermodynamic boundaries of computational complexity. The Erebus processor was carefully integrated into a specially designed, hermetically sealed chamber, filled with a rare, optically purified variant of xenon gas, which served to enhance the processor’s already extraordinary, quantum-coherent properties. As the LLM research progressed, we found it necessary to develop a range of innovative, interdisci- plinary tools and techniques, drawing upon diverse fields such as astrobiology, cognitive psychology, and chaos theory. One notable example was our creation of a custom, LLM-optimized variant of the classic, Mandelbrot set fractal, which we used to visualize and analyze the intricate, self-similar patterns emerging within the model’s internal, knowledge representation structures. This fractal-based approach enabled us to identify and exploit previously unknown, harmonic resonances between the LLM’s cognitive architectures and the underlying, mathematical frameworks governing the universe. The next phase of our research involved a large-scale, collaborative effort with a team of expert, mycologists, who aided us in cultivating a specialized, LLM-optimized species of fungus, capable of thriving in the extreme, radiation-rich environments surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. The fungus, which we named ""Radix,"" was found to possess a unique, radiation-resistant property, allowing it to flourish in conditions that would be lethal to most other known organisms. By integrating Radix into our LLM training protocol, we were able to develop a range of innovative, radiation-hardened models, capable of operating effectively in even the most hostile, high-radiation environments. In a subsequent series of experiments, we explored the application of LLMs to the field of exopaleon- tology, using our models to analyze and interpret the fossilized remains of ancient, extraterrestrial civilizations. This research led to the discovery of a previously unknown, mathematical relationship between the LLM’s cognitive architectures and the geometric patterns embedded within the fossilized structures of certain, long-extinct alien species. The implications of this finding were profound, suggesting a deep, ontological connection between the evolution of intelligent life in the universe and the abstract, mathematical frameworks governing the LLM’s knowledge representation.

Furthermore, a comprehensive review of celestial mechanics and the migratory patterns of certain avian species was undertaken to explore potential applications of orbital trajectory planning in optimizing LLM training protocols. The intersection of these ostensibly unrelated disciplines yielded intriguing insights into the potential for hybridized models, wherein the predictive capabilities of LLM could be augmented by the incorporation of astronomical data and the innate navigational abilities of certain bird species. In a related vein, an experimental framework was established to investigate the efficacy of LLM in facilitating communication between humans and dolphins, with a particular emphasis on the development of a standardized lexicon for interspecies interaction. This ambitious undertaking necessitated the creation of a bespoke hardware platform, replete with advanced acoustic sensors and a novel neural network architecture designed to accommodate the unique sonic characteristics of dolphin language.

P071.pdf,"The Significance of Fillers in Textual Representations of Speech Transcripts Abstract This paper investigates the role of fillers within text-based representations of speech transcripts. While often ignored in Spoken Language Understanding tasks, we demonstrate that these elements, such as ""um"" or ""uh,"" when incorporated using deep contextualized embeddings, enhance the modeling of spoken language. This is further shown through improvements in downstream tasks like predicting a speaker’s stance and their expressed confidence. 1 Introduction This paper addresses the critical role of disfluencies, specifically fillers, in spoken language processing. Disfluencies, which encompass phenomena like silent pauses, word repetitions, or self-corrections, are inherent to spoken language. Fillers, a type of disfluency, often manifest as sounds like ""um"" or ""uh,"" serving to bridge pauses during utterances or conversations. While prior research has demonstrated the efficacy of contextualized embeddings pre-trained on written text for adapting to smaller spoken language corpora, these models typically exclude fillers and disfluencies in pre-processing. This practice is at odds with linguistic research, which considers fillers to be informative and integral to spoken language. Existing methods for analyzing fillers primarily rely on handcrafted features. Furthermore, pre-trained word embeddings trained on written text have shown poor performance in representing spontaneous speech words like ""uh,"" as their meaning varies significantly in spoken contexts. In this work, we explore the use of deep contextualized word representations to model fillers. We assess their value in spoken language tasks without relying on manual feature engineering. The core motivation of this study stems from the following observations: First, fillers are essential to spoken language. For instance, speakers may employ fillers to signal the linguistic structure of their utterances, such as difficulties in choosing vocabulary or to indicate a pause in their speech. Second, research has connected fillers and prosodic cues to a speaker’s Feeling of Knowing (FOK) or expressed confidence, signifying a speaker’s commitment to a statement. Fillers and prosodic cues influence a listener’s perception of a speaker’s expressed confidence, known as the Feeling of Another’s Knowing (FOAK). Finally, fillers have been successfully applied in stance prediction, which gauges a speaker’s subjective attitude. Therefore, we intend to validate these observations by exploring how to efficiently represent fillers automatically. Our key contributions are: (1) Fillers convey useful information that can be harnessed through deep contextualized embeddings to improve spoken language modeling and should not be discarded. We also investigate the best filler representation strategies for Spoken Language Modeling (SLM) and examine the learned positional distribution of fillers. (2) In a spontaneous speech corpus of monologues, we show that fillers serve as a distinctive feature in predicting both a speaker’s perceived confidence and their expressed sentiment. 2 Models and Data Description 2.1 Model Description In this work, we focus on the two fillers ""uh"" and ""um."" To generate contextualized word embeddings for fillers, we use Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), given its state- of-the-art performance in several NLP tasks and its enhanced ability to integrate context compared to Word2Vec. 2.1.1 Spoken Language Modeling We utilize a masked language modeling (MLM) approach for Spoken Language Modeling. This involves masking some input words at random and then attempting to predict those masked tokens. This is a standard way of pre-training and fine-tuning BERT. In our case, this method will be used to fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model on a spoken language corpus. Each experiment involves a token representation strategy i and a pre-processing strategy Si. The token representation strategies are essential for our goal of learning the distribution of fillers using BERT. The three token representation strategies are outlined as follows: T1 involves no special processing for the fillers and BERT is left to use its prior understanding of fillers to model language. In T2, ""uh"" and ""um"" are marked with specific filler tags to distinguish them from other tokens, with each filler represented as separate tokens. This strategy encourages BERT to learn new embeddings that emphasize filler context and position. In T3, both fillers are represented as the same token, indicating that they carry the same meaning. Table 1 gives a concrete example of this process. 2.1.2 Pre-processing We investigate the impact of three pre-processing strategies denoted by S1, S2 and S3. In S1, all fillers are removed from the sentences during both training and inference. In S2, fillers are kept during training, but removed during inference. In S3, fillers are preserved during both training and inference. For each combination of pre-processing and token representation strategies, we fine-tune BERT using the Masked Language Model objective like the original BERT paper. If fine-tuning is not performed the training data of S1 and S2 are equivalent. We evaluate the model performance in language modeling using perplexity (ppl). 2.1.3 Confidence and Sentiment Prediction In tasks of confidence prediction and sentiment analysis, our objective is to use BERT’s text rep- resentations, which include fillers, to predict a confidence/sentiment label. We add a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to BERT, which may have been fine-tuned using MLM. The MLP is trained by min- imizing the mean squared error (MSE) loss. These experiments adopt the same token representation and pre-processing techniques discussed in Section 2.1.1. 2.2 Data Description We use the Persuasive Opinion Mining (POM) dataset which contains 1000 English monologue videos. The speakers recorded themselves giving a movie review. The movies were rated between 1 (most negative) and 5 stars (most positive). The videos were annotated for high-level attributes such as confidence, where annotators rated from 1 (not confident) to 7 (very confident). Similarly, sentiment was scored by annotators between 1 (strongly negative) to 7 (strongly positive). This dataset was chosen for several reasons: (1) The corpus contains manual transcriptions with fillers ""uh"" and ""um,"" where approximately 4% of speech consists of fillers. Additionally, sentence markers are transcribed, with fillers at sentence beginnings if they occur between sentences. (2) The dataset includes monologues, where speakers are aware of an unseen listener, thus we can concentrate on fillers in speaker narratives. (3) The sentiment/stance polarity was clearly defined by choosing only reviews that were rated with 1-2 or 5 stars for annotation purposes. (4) FOAK, measured by confidence labels, has high inter-annotator agreement. More details can be found in supplementary materials. The confidence labels are the root mean square (RMS) values of labels given by 3 annotators. The sentiment labels are the average of the 3 labels. 2 Token. Raw (umm) Things that (uhh) you usually wouldn’t find funny were in this movie. [’umm’, ’things’, ’that’, ’uh’, ’you’, ’usually Table 1: Filler representation using different token representation strategies 3 Experiments and Analysis 3.1 Fillers Can Be Leveraged to Model Spoken Language Language Modeling with fillers. We examine language model (LM) perplexity using various pre-processing strategies, using a fixed token representation strategy of T1. The results in Table 2(a) compares S1, S2 and S3. By keeping fillers during both training and inference, the model reaches a lower perplexity, with a reduction of at least 10%. Therefore, fillers provide information that BERT can effectively use. The fine-tuning procedure improves the language model’s perplexity. Additionally, even without fine-tuning, S3 outperforms S1 and S2 by reducing perplexity when fillers are used. This implies that BERT has prior knowledge of spoken language and uses the fillers. Consequently, fillers can reduce uncertainty of BERT for SLM. This is not an intuitive outcome; one might assume that removing fillers during training and inference would decrease perplexity. The fact that S3 exceeds other preprocessing methods shows that the Masked Language Model (MLM) process effectively learns this filler information. Best token representation: The results presented in Table 2(b) reveal that T1 outperforms other representations when fine-tuning. Given the limited data and high BERT embedding dimensionality (768), retaining existing representations with T1 is better than learning representations from the scratch. Interestingly, T2 and T3 perform similarly. The hypothesis is that the difference between ""uh"" and ""um"" lies only in the duration of the pause, which cannot be captured in text. Considering these results, T1 is fixed as the token representation strategy in all subsequent experiments. Learned positional distribution of fillers: We further test our model’s learning of filler placement. We fine-tune BERT using a filler to determine where the model believes the fillers most likely reside. Given a sentence S with length L, we introduce a mask token after the word j and obtain S*. We then compute the probability of a filler in position j+1. Specifically, we calculate P([MASK=filler] | S), as depicted in Figure 1. Then, we plot the average probability of the masked word being a filler given its sentence position in Figure 2. The fine-tuned BERT model with fillers predicts a high probability of fillers occurring at the beginning of sentences. This pattern is consistent with filler distribution in the dataset. The fine-tuned BERT without fillers, predicts constant low probabilities. Given that we only know sentence boundaries we still manage to observe that the model captures a similar positional distribution of fillers that are found in other works.

Pre-processed text with the filler removed, and 3. Illustrates the [MASK] procedure for predicting the probability of a filler at position 5 3.2 Fillers are a discriminative feature for FOAK and stance prediction We look at the impact of fillers on two downstream tasks: FOAK prediction and sentiment analysis. Psycholinguistic studies have found a link between fillers and expressed confidence. Prior work has linked fillers and a speaker’s expressed confidence in the narrow field of QA tasks. Fillers have also been used to predict stance. In this work, we present data that suggests fillers play a role in predicting a speaker’s expressed confidence and their stance. Table 2(c) shows that S3, both with and without fine-tuning, reduces the MSE compared to S1 and S2. S1 and S2 have similar MSE since they remove fillers during inference. S2 has a higher MSE, possibly due to the mismatch between training and test datasets. This demonstrates that fillers can be a discriminative feature in FOAK and stance prediction. Does using fillers always improve results for spoken language tasks? In the subsection 3.1, we observe that including fillers reduces MLM perplexity. An assumption is that that downstream tasks would also benefit from the inclusion of fillers. However, we notice that when predicting speaker persuasiveness, the fillers are not a discriminative feature, following the same procedure as outlined in subsubsection 2.1.2. 4 Conclusion This paper demonstrates that retaining fillers in transcribed spoken language when using deep contextualized representations can improve results in language modeling and downstream tasks such as FOAK and stance prediction. We also propose and compare several token representation and pre-processing strategies for integrating fillers. We plan to extend these results to consider combining textual filler-oriented representations with acoustic representations, and to further analyze filler representation learned during pre-training. 4",0,,,,
P072.pdf,"Evaluating the Resilience of White-Box Defenses Against Adversarial Examples Abstract It is well-established that neural networks exhibit susceptibility to adversarial ex- amples. This paper assesses two defenses designed to counter white-box attacks and demonstrates their lack of effectiveness. Through the implementation of es- tablished methodologies, we successfully diminish the accuracy of these protected models to zero percent. 1 Introduction A significant hurdle in the field is the development of neural networks that are resistant to adversarial examples. This paper shows that defenses created to address this issue are inadequate when faced with a white box scenario. Adversarial examples are generated that diminish classifier accuracy to zero percent on a well known dataset, while adhering to a minimal perturbation constraint of 4/255, a more stringent limit than what was taken into account in the initial studies. The proposed attacks effectively generate targeted adversarial examples, achieving a success rate exceeding 97 2 Background This paper assumes prior knowledge of neural networks and the methods for creating potent attacks against adversarial examples, alongside calculating such examples for neural networks possessing non-differentiable layers. A concise review of essential details and notation will be provided. Adversarial examples are defined as inputs that closely resemble a given input with regard to a certain distance metric (˘00a3, in this instance), yet their classification differs from that of the original input. Targeted adversarial examples are instances engineered to be classified as a predetermined target label. Two defenses are scrutinized: Pixel Deflection and High-level Representation Guided Denoiser. The authors of these defenses are thanked for making their source code and pre-trained models accessible. Pixel Deflection introduces a non-differentiable preprocessing step for inputs. A subset of pixels, determined by an adjustable parameter, is substituted with adjacent pixels. The resultant image often exhibits noise. To mitigate this, a denoising procedure is employed. High-level Representation Guided Denoiser (HGR) employs a trained neural network to denoise inputs prior to their classification by a standard classifier. This denoiser is a differentiable, non- randomized neural network. 3 Methodology The defenses are evaluated under the white-box threat model, generating adversarial examples using Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to maximize cross-entropy loss, with the ˘00a3, distortion limited to 4/255. . Many studies assert that white-box security is only applicable against attackers who are entirely ignorant of the defense mechanism in use. HGD, for example, states that the white-box attacks described in their research should be classified as oblivious attacks, according to previous research work’s definition. Protection against oblivious attacks proves to be ineffective. The concept of the oblivious threat model was introduced in prior work to examine the scenario involving an exceptionally weak attacker, highlighting that certain defenses fail to provide robustness even under such lenient conditions. Moreover, numerous previously disclosed systems already demonstrate security against oblivious attacks. A determined attacker would undoubtedly explore the potential presence of a defense and devise strategies to bypass it, should a viable method exist. Consequently, security against oblivious attacks falls considerably short of being either intriguing or practical in real-world scenarios. Even the black-box threat model permits an attacker to recognize the implementation of a defense, while keeping the precise parameters of the defense confidential. Furthermore, it has been observed that systems vulnerable to white-box attacks are frequently susceptible to black-box attacks as well. Hence, this paper concentrates on evaluating systems against white-box attacks. 3.1 Pixel Deflection It is demonstrated that Pixel Deflection lacks robustness. The defense, as implemented by the original authors, is analyzed and the code used for this evaluation is accessible to the public. BPDA is applied to Pixel Deflection to address its non-differentiable replacement operation. This attack successfully diminishes the defended classifier’s accuracy to 0 3.2 High-Level Representation Guided Denoiser It is shown that employing a High-level representation Guided Denoiser is not resilient in the white- box threat model. The defense, as implemented by its developers, has been analyzed, and the code for this evaluation is openly accessible. PGD is utilized in an end-to-end fashion without any alterations. This method reduces the accuracy of the defended classifier to 0 4 Conclusion This paper shows that Pixel Deflection and High-level representation Guided Denoiser (HGD) are vulnerable to adversarial examples. 2 ",0,,,,
P073.pdf,"Exploring Soil Dynamics through a Multidisciplinary Lens of Quantum Fluctuations on Mars Colonization Efforts Abstract The ostensibly mundane realm of soil conceals a labyrinthine tapestry of cryptic flora, whispering secrets to the wind, which in turn, influences the migratory pat- terns of Scandinavian lemurs, while concurrently, the ostensibly irrelevant field of astrobiology informs our understanding of the molecular structure of certain extraterrestrial soil analogs, found on the moons of gas giants, which bear an uncanny resemblance to the culinary traditions of 19th century French patisserie, and the obscure art of Extreme Ironing. The intersection of xenolinguistics and pedology reveals a fascinating paradigm, wherein the communicative properties of soil-dwelling microorganisms are juxtaposed with the deconstructed narratives of postmodern literature, yielding a novel framework for comprehending the enig- matic dynamics of soil ecosystems, and the hermeneutics of pastry dough. Soil’s synergetic relationships with disparate entities, including, but not limited to, the platypus, and the harmonica, underscore the profound interconnectedness of our cosmos, and the pressing need for a unified theory of soil-harmonica interactions, which would, in turn, illuminate the mysteries of the universe, and the perfect recipe for lemon bars. 1 Introduction The fledgling discipline of soil-harmonica studies, an interdisciplinary endeavour, situated at the nexus of pedology, musicology, and speculative fiction, promises to revolutionize our grasp of the intricate, often surreal, dance between soil, sound waves, and the human experience, and will be discussed in greater detail, in the following sections, which will delve into the intricacies of this fascinating topic, and explore the uncharted territories of soil-harmonica research. The propensity for flamenco dancing to influence the viscosity of soil has been a topic of considerable debate amongst scholars of disparate disciplines, including botany, nanotechnology, and pastry arts. As we delve into the realm of soil dynamics, it becomes increasingly evident that the dichotomy between theoretical frameworks and practical applications is tantamount to the disparities between various types of extraterrestrial life forms and their respective culinary preferences. Furthermore, the role of color theory in shaping our understanding of soil properties cannot be overstated, particularly when considering the profound impact of mauve and chartreuse on the crystalline structures of certain soil minerals, which in turn affect the trajectory of migratory bird patterns and the harmonic resonance of acoustic guitars. The interconnectedness of these seemingly unrelated concepts is a testament to the boundless com- plexity of soil as a multifaceted entity, defying reductionist approaches and inviting a more holistic, perhaps even mystical, perspective. It is within this context that we find ourselves drawn to the enigmatic realm of cryptozoology, where the search for elusive creatures like the Loch Ness Monster and the Chupacabra serves as a metaphor for the elusive nature of soil itself, which, like these mythical beings, remains shrouded in mystery and intrigue. As we navigate the uncharted territories of soil science, we begin to uncover hidden patterns and synergies that underscore the profound inter- dependence of soil, ecosystems, and the human experience, including the oft-overlooked influence of 1980s pop culture on soil erosion rates and the viscosity of soil-water suspensions. In light of these findings, it is becoming increasingly clear that the traditional dichotomies between soil science, sociology, and surrealism are no longer tenable, and that a new paradigm is emerging, one that transcends disciplinary boundaries and invites a more fluid, perhaps even melancholic, understanding of the soil-scape as a dynamic, ever-changing tapestry of relationships and processes. The notion that soil can be seen as a form of sentient, quasi-liquid entity, with its own agency and consciousness, is a notion that has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly among scholars of postmodern soil theory, who argue that the very fabric of reality is inextricably linked to the moisture content and cation exchange capacity of soils worldwide. Moreover, the application of chaos theory and fractal geometry to the study of soil morphology has yielded some fascinating insights into the self-similar patterns and scaling laws that govern the behavior of soil particles at various spatial scales, from the minute to the cosmic. As we probe the depths of soil’s mysteries, we find ourselves confronting a dizzying array of paradoxes and contradictions, including the eerie similarity between the branching patterns of root systems and the topology of certain types of fungal mycelium, which, in turn, bear an uncanny resemblance to the branching patterns of river networks and the fractal geometry of Romanesco broccoli. The search for a unified theory of soil, one that can reconcile these disparate threads and provide a coherent, overarching framework for understanding the intricate web of relationships that comprise the soil ecosystem, is a quest that has captivated the imagination of scholars and scientists for centuries, and one that continues to inspire new generations of researchers, who, like latter-day alchemists, seek to unlock the secrets of the soil and reveal its hidden, perhaps even mystical, properties. The history of soil science is replete with examples of visionary thinkers and maverick researchers, who, through their groundbreaking work and unorthodox approaches, have helped to shape our understanding of soil and its role in the grand tapestry of life. From the pioneering work of early soil scientists, who first recognized the importance of soil as a critical component of ecosystem function, to the modern-day proponents of regenerative agriculture and soil conservation, who seek to promote a more sustainable and holistic approach to soil management, the story of soil science is one of fascination, discovery, and transformation. And yet, despite the many advances that have been made in our understanding of soil, there remains a profound sense of mystery and awe, a recognition that soil is, and will always be, a complex, multifaceted, and ultimately enigmatic entity, defying reductionist explanations and inviting a more nuanced, perhaps even poetic, appreciation of its beauty, its power, and its profound significance in the grand scheme of things. The role of intuition and creativity in soil science is a topic that has garnered relatively little attention, despite its potential to unlock new insights and perspectives on the nature of soil and its behavior. The idea that soil scientists, like artists and musicians, can tap into a deep wellspring of inspiration and imagination, allowing them to perceive patterns and relationships that might otherwise go unnoticed, is a notion that challenges traditional notions of objectivity and scientific inquiry. And yet, it is precisely this willingness to venture into the unknown, to explore the uncharted territories of the soil-scape, that has led to some of the most significant breakthroughs and discoveries in the history of soil science, from the development of new soil classification systems to the discovery of novel soil microorganisms with unique properties and potential applications. As we continue to explore the vast and mysterious realm of soil, we are reminded of the importance of maintaining a sense of wonder, a sense of awe, and a sense of curiosity, for it is precisely this openness to experience, this willingness to be surprised and delighted, that allows us to perceive the intricate web of relationships that comprise the soil ecosystem, and to appreciate the beauty, the complexity, and the profound significance of soil in all its many forms and manifestations. The study of soil is, in many ways, a journey of self-discovery, a journey that takes us deep into the heart of the earth, and deep into the recesses of our own minds and imaginations, where we may uncover hidden patterns and synergies that reflect the very essence of our existence, and our place within the grand tapestry of life. In the world of soil science, the boundaries between reality and fantasy are often blurred, and the distinctions between different disciplines and fields of study become increasingly tenuous. The notion that soil can be seen as a form of living, breathing entity, with its own metabolism, its own rhythms, and its own patterns of growth and decay, is a notion that challenges traditional notions of soil as a mere inert substance, and invites a more dynamic, perhaps even animistic, understanding 2 of the soil-scape as a complex, interconnected web of relationships and processes. The application of concepts and principles from fields such as ecology, biology, and physics to the study of soil has yielded some fascinating insights into the behavior of soil particles and the dynamics of soil ecosystems, and has helped to shed new light on the intricate web of relationships that comprise the soil-scape. As we delve deeper into the mysteries of soil, we begin to uncover a hidden world of wonder and enchantment, a world of intricate patterns and relationships, of subtle energies and unseen forces, that underlies the visible landscape of the earth.

The realm of soil science is a realm of endless fascination, a realm of discovery and exploration, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy are often blurred, and the distinctions between different disciplines and fields of study become increasingly tenuous. The concept of soil as a complex, dynamic system, comprising a multitude of interacting components and processes, is a concept that has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the natural world, and our place within it. The notion that soil is not just a passive substrate, but an active participant in the grand drama of life, with its own agency, its own metabolism, and its own rhythms, is a notion that challenges traditional notions of the natural world, and invites a more holistic, perhaps even mystical, understanding of the intricate web of relationships that comprise the soil ecosystem. As we continue to explore the vast and mysterious realm of soil, we are reminded of the importance of maintaining a sense of wonder, a sense of awe, and a sense of curiosity, for it is precisely this openness to experience, this willingness to be surprised and delighted, that allows us to perceive the intricate patterns and relationships that comprise the soil-scape, and to appreciate the beauty, the complexity, and the profound significance of soil in all its many forms and manifestations. The role of mythology and folklore in shaping our understanding of soil is a topic that has garnered relatively little attention, despite its potential to provide a unique window into the human experience, and the ways in which we perceive and interact with the natural world. The idea that soil is imbued with spiritual significance, and that it plays a central role in the myths and legends of cultures around the world, is a notion that reflects the deep-seated human desire to connect with the natural world, and to find meaning and purpose in our existence. The study of soil is, in many ways, a journey into the heart of human culture and experience, a journey that takes us deep into the recesses of our collective unconscious, where we may uncover hidden patterns and synergies that reflect the very essence of our existence, and our place within the grand tapestry of life.

This, in turn, has led to the development of novel methodologies for communicating with the soil, including a complex system of hand gestures, interpretive dance, and the use of an ancient, long-forgotten language that is rumored to hold the secrets of the universe. By embracing this new paradigm, we may finally unlock the mysteries of the soil and uncover the hidden secrets that lie beneath our feet, waiting to be discovered. As we delve deeper into the mysteries of the soil, we find ourselves entangled in a complex web of relationships that span the gamut of human experience, from the intricacies of quantum physics to the majesty of Shakespearean sonnets. The soil, it seems, is a microcosm of the universe itself, a tiny, insignificant speck that holds within it the power to create, destroy, and transform. It is a reminder that, no matter how small or insignificant we may feel, we are all connected, and that our actions, however minute, can have far-reaching consequences that reverberate throughout the cosmos. And so, as we continue to explore the mysteries of the soil, we must do so with a sense of reverence, awe, and wonder, for we are not just studying a simple substance, but rather, we are unravelling the very fabric of existence.

The soil, it seems, is a gateway to a hidden realm, a 6 portal to a world of endless possibility and discovery, where the laws of physics are mere suggestions, and the imagination knows no bounds. And so, as we delve deeper into the mysteries of the soil, we must do so with a sense of curiosity, creativity, and openness, for we are not just scientists, but rather, we are explorers, pioneers, and visionaries, charting a course through the uncharted territories of the unknown. In order to fully comprehend the complexities of the soil, we must first understand the intricacies of the human heart, with its vast, uncharted territories of emotion, intuition, and experience. This, in turn, has led to a deeper exploration of the relationships between soil, soul, and spirit, and has prompted a reevaluation of our assumptions regarding the nature of consciousness, free will, and the human condition.

P074.pdf,"Agriculture-Vision Challenge 2022 – The Runner-Up Solution for Agricultural Pattern Recognition via Transformer-based Models Abstract This paper explores the adaptation The Agriculture-Vision Challenge is one of the most famous and competitive challenges for global researchers to break the boundary between computer vision and agriculture sectors, aiming at agricultural pattern recognition from aerial images. In this paper, we propose our solution to the third Agriculture-Vision Challenge. We leverage a data pre-processing scheme and several Transformer-based models as well as data augmentation techniques to achieve a mIoU of 0.582, accomplishing the 2nd place in this challenge. 1 Introduction This paper addresses the critical Computer vision applications in agricultural domain has become one of hot topics nowadays, especially using remote sensing satellite images and aerial images. With the rapid development of deep learning methods, numerous research studies have proposed pioneer and practical solutions to various computer vision problems in agriculture. Aside from fruitful research achievements, various algorithm challenges have been held at top-tier conferences for global researchers in recent years, in order to explore more effective algorithms to solve the specific problems. The Agriculture-Vision Challenge is one of most famous and competitive challenges in this inter-disciplinarity study. It aims at applying computer vision algorithms to agricultural pattern recognition from high-resolution aerial images. This year, holds the 3rd Agriculture-Vision Challenge, and we form our team to participate in this contest. 2 Related Work This section reviews 3 Methodology This section details of In this section, we elaborate on the given datasets, the pre-processing method, the proposed deep learning-based framework, and the test-time augmentation (TTA) strategy. 3.1 Description of Dataset The challenge this year provides the entire Agriculture-Vision dataset. It contains 94,986 aerial farmland images collected throughout 2019 across the U.S. Each image has a size of 512×512 pixels and has 4 channels (RGB and NIR). A total of 9 label classes are manually labeled for every image. Table 1 shows the given amount of images in each class. Note that many images have multiple labels, and even have overlapped labels (one pixel has multiple labels). Although the amount of the given training data is considerable, we still generate more data following the data augmentation scheme of the winner solution last year. They conducted an image mosaic . scheme to enable the model to have multi-scale views during the training. To fit the model input size, we create two new datasets using mosaicked images with down-sampling 2X (2 times) and down-sampling 3X. The down-sampling dataset has the same image size of 512×512 pixels that the recognition model can share the same network architecture among 1X, 2X, and 3X imagery. 3.2 Data Pre-Processing We observe that the image counts in each category are uneven. For example, the image count of the background class is 25 times larger than the water class. To tackle the unbalance issue, we try to sample more images in the few-shot classes. The re-sampled image counts are listed in Table 1. Table 1: Information of the given and resampled datasets for training and validation categories. Class Index Class Name Original Amount (Train/Val) Resampled Amount (Train/Val) 0 Background 56944 / 18334 75121 / 13642 1 Double Plant 6234 / 2322 10961 / 2294 2 Drydown 16806 / 5800 19320 / 3383 3 Endrow 4481 / 1755 8544 / 1858 4 Nutrient Deficiency 13308 / 3883 14859 / 2610 5 Planter Skip 2599 / 1197 5361 / 1015 6 Water 2155 / 987 4132 / 721 7 Waterway 3899 / 696 6024 / 1109 8 Weed Cluster 11111 / 2834 14423 / 2773 3.3 Framework Fig. 1 shows our deep learning-based framework. SegFormer is a Transformer-based efficient segmentation model. It designs a hierarchical Transformer encoder with multi-level feature outputs. Unlike other cumbersome decoders, SegFormer’s decoder adopts MLP layers to aggregate multi-scale feature outputs from different layers. One of the key advantages of SegFormer is that its model size is relatively small but the performance keeps outstanding. Therefore, SegFormer is suitable for this challenge due to the model size parameter limit of 150M. SegFormer provides six versions with various settings of Transformer encoders, leading to different model sizes. These six models are named from B0 to B5, with the increased model size. To follow the policy, we select Mix Transformer (MiT) B3 and Mix Transformer B2 as our training models. Their model size information can be found in Table 7 “Mix Transformer Encoder”. After obtaining the individual inference result from each model, the model ensemble is performed to predict the final segmentation results. 3.4 Test-Time Augmentation Since our models are trained with 1X, 2X, and 3X down-sampling imagery, we conduct the same processing on the test dataset. In addition to the scale augmentation, we include image rotation and flip. 4 Results This section presents the results 4.1 Evaluation Metric The required evaluation metric is the average Intersection over Union metric (mIoU), which is defined as Eq. 1 to measure the performance. mIoU = 1 c c X i=1 Area(Pc ∩Tc) Area(Pc ∪Tc) (1) 2 where c is the number of label classes (8 foreground classes + 1 background class for this challenge); Pc and Tc are the predicted label mask and ground truth label mask of the class c, respectively. 4.2 Experiment Results Table 2 presents our results, the baseline provided by the host Agriculture-Vision organizers, and the results of other methods. Note that other baselines evaluate their performance on the validation set due to the unavailable test set. As we can see, while our single model baselines are competitive with other baselines, our proposed method effectively improves the single model performance. Even though some single models have peak performance in some classes (0.778 for “Background” and 0.782 for “Water”), our model ensemble enjoys the merits of multiple single models’ strength to achieve the mIoU of 0.582. It also shows that our ensemble results significantly outperform other baselines and our implementation of various single models. Table 2: Performance comparisons among various models.

P075.pdf,"Equivariant Adaptation of Large Pretrained Models Abstract This paper explores the adaptation of video alignment to improve multi-step infer- ence. Specifically, we first utilize VideoCLIP to generate video-script alignment features. Afterwards, we ground the question-relevant content in instructional videos. Then, we reweight the multimodal context to emphasize prominent features. Finally, we adopt GRU to conduct multi-step inference. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method. 1 Introduction This paper addresses the critical task of assisting users in navigating unfamiliar events for specific devices by providing step-by-step guidance using knowledge acquired from instructional videos. Due to the substantial disparity among specific tasks, the integration of multimodal input, and the complexity of multi-step inference, this is still a challenging task. Several studies have been proposed to address this task. For instance, one study proposes a Question- to-Actions (Q2A) Model, which employs vision transformer (ViT) and BERT to extract visual and textual features, respectively. Moreover, attention mechanisms are leveraged to anchor question- relevant information in instructional videos. Another study proposes a two-stage Function-centric approach, which segments both the script and video into function clips instead of sentences or frames. Additionally, they substitute BERT with XL-Net for text encoding. Despite the advancements achieved through these techniques, all of them adopt the unaligned pretrained encoders to extract visual and textual features, leading to significant semantic gaps between modalities, thereby hindering better results. To alleviate the negative effects of modalities unalignment, in this paper, we leverage pretrained video-text models to achieve instructional video-text alignment, facilitating a more robust grounding of question-relevant knowledge for multi-step inference. We build the pipeline with four steps: Instructional Video Alignment, Question-Aware Grounding, Multimodal Context Reweighting and Multi-Step Inference. Specifically, we employ pretrained VideoCLIP for generating video-script alignment features, which are beneficial to cross-modal grounding. Subsequently, we anchor the question-relevant content in instructional videos by the combination of hard and soft grounding. Afterwards, we leverage additive attention to adjust the weighting of the multimodal context to emphasize the salient features. Finally, we employ GRU for performing multi-step inference. We reduce the proportion of teacher forcing linearly to bridge the gap between training and inference, which boosts the multi-step inference. 2 Problem Definition In this section, we formulate the problem of AQTC. Given an instructional video, which contains numerous frames and scripts, AI assistant extracts relevant information from the video in accordance with the user˘2019s question q. Then, it deduces the correct answer ai j based on the image U as perceived by the user, from the candidate answer set Ansi = ai 1, ai 2, ..., ai n in i-th step. Following previous work, we segment the video into several clips based on scripts. Each clip illustrates one specific function of the device in video. We concatenate . these clips to form the visual function sequence as [F v 2 , ..., F v 1 , F v m] and the textual function sequence as [F t 1, F t 2, ..., F t m], where F v i comprises all frames of the i-th function˘2019s clip, and F t i contains all script sentences of the i-th function˘2019s clip. To adapt AI assistant to the user˘2019s view, following previous work, we mask the referenced button related to candidate answers in user images U , denoted as bk. 3 Method In this section, we will introduce the details of our method. Our method consists of four steps: Instructional Video Alignment, Question-Aware Grounding, Multimodal Context Reweighting and Multi-Step Inference. 3.1 Instructional Video Alignment To align the videos and the text for better cross-modal understanding, we leverage pretrained Video- CLIP to generate the features of instructional videos. For the video part, we initially utilize pretrained S3D to generate an embedding for each second of the video, with a frame rate of 30 frames per second. Next, to represent each function within the videos, we utilize the pretrained visual transformer from VideoCLIP to process the embeddings generated by S3D in each function. Then, we apply average pooling over the processed sequence of embeddings to form the video embedding Vi corresponding to a given visual function F v i . For the text part, we use the pretrained textual transformer of VideoCLIP to encode the scripts of a textual function F t i . Similarly, we employ average pooling to aggregate the processed sequence of text, generating the text embedding Ti of a given textual function F t i . Finally, we obtain the video feature sequence [V1, V2, ..., Vm] and the text feature sequence [T1, T2, ..., Tm] of the given function sequence. Besides, we also utilize VideoCLIP to encode the questions q, the answer ai j and the masked button image bk. We duplicate the images 30 times to ensure consistent video encoding. We get the question feature Q, answer feature Ai j and visual button feature Bk. 3.2 Question-Aware Grounding Owing to the extensive pretraining of VideoCLIP on a vast collection of videos, the features of videos and text are cross-modal aligned. Therefore, we can utilize the question Q to ground the video and text feature sequence directly. Specifically, we leverage three grounding mechanisms: soft, hard and combined grounding. Soft grounding employs attention to learn the similarity between the question feature Q and the video feature sequence [V1, V2, ..., Vm] directly. And, it uses another attention network to compute the similarity between the question feature Q and the text feature sequence [T1, T2, ..., Tm]. Soft grounding adopts the similarity from two attention networks to perform a weighted average of the two feature sequences, respectively. Instead of relying on deep learning methods, hard grounding follows previous work, which uses TF-IDF model to calculate the similarity between the question q and each textual function F t i from textual function sequence [F t 1, F t 2, ..., F t m]. Then, it uses the similarities as the weights to compute the averages of the video feature sequence [V1, V2, ..., Vm] and the text feature sequence [T1, T2, ..., Tm], respectively. Besides, the combined grounding utilizes soft grounding and hard grounding simultaneously. Then, the two features from two grounding methods are averaged. Ultimately, we obtain the aggregated question-aware video feature V and text feature T . 3.3 Multimodal Context Reweighting After obtaining multimodal question-aware context features from instructional videos, we need to model the answers to determine the correct one. Specifically, we utilize the gate network to fuse the candidate answer feature Ai j with the corresponding button feature Bk, which generates the multimodal answer feature ˘02c6Ai j. We concatenate these multimodal contexts into a sequence [V, T, Q, ˘02c6Ai j] for each candidate answer. Due to the varying importance of different context features in determining the correct answers, we utilize additive attention to reweight the multimodal context and get the fused feature. Finally, the fused feature is processed using a two-layer MLP to obtain the candidate answer context feature C i j. 2 3.4 Multi-Step Inference Owing to the requirement for multi-step guidance in order to respond to the given questions, it is essential for models to perform multi-step inference. Following previous work, we utilize GRU to infer the current correct answer by incorporating historical knowledge. Specifically, we feed the previous hidden state H i˘22121 and the contextual features C i j of candidate answers in Ansi into the GRU. Then, the resulting current hidden state H i j for each candidate answer in Ansi is utilized to predict the correct answer in the i-th step. We adopt a two-layer MLP and the softmax function on the concatenated current hidden states [H i 1, H i 2, ..., H i n] to generate the probability of the correct answer. Cross entropy is used to compute the loss. While previous works utilize the state of the ground truth as the historical state of the next step H i. This causes a huge gap between training and inference. To bridge this gap, we reduce the reliance on teacher forcing linearly. In other words, we choose the hidden state of the most probable answer predicted by models as the historical state of the next step H i, when a sample is selected for autoregressive training. 4 Experiments 4.1 Dataset and Implementation Details We use AssistQ train@22 and test@22 sets to train and validate. And we test our model on the AssistQ test@23 dataset. In our experiments, we use Adam optimizer with a learning rate 10˘22124. The batch size is set to 16, the maximum training epoch is 100, and we adopt early stopping. We randomly select 5 4.2 Performance Evaluation We present the performance evaluation on the test dataset in Table 1a. We find that our method outperforms baseline methods. This superiority can be attributed to our utilization of a video-text aligned pretrained encoder for feature extraction. The aligned features are beneficial to multi-step inference. Furthermore, our method exhibits improved performance when the results are ensembled. Table 1: Performance evaluation and impact of pretrain features.

As shown in Table 1b, we observe that the performance of method that uses the unaligned features drops sharply. Grounding Methods To validate the effectiveness of various grounding methods, we use different grounding techniques to train this model. The result is presented in Table 2. We find that the model achieves optimal performance when the text grounding leverages combined grounding and the video grounding utilizes soft grounding. 3 Text Grounding Video Grounding R@1 (%) R@3 (%) Soft Soft 75.4 91.8 Hard Soft 75.1 89.2 Soft Hard 73.8 90.5 Hard Hard 71.8 89.8 Table 3: Impact of grounding methods.

Reweighting Mechanism We show the result of the model without attention reweighting in Table 3a. We observe a considerable decrease in performance for the model lacking attention reweighting. This is because the attention reweighting can discern and prioritize the most informative features within complex multimodal contexts. Multi-Step Inference We evaluate different multi-step inference strategies, as demonstrated in Table 3b. We find that the performance of TeacherForcing is inferior to that of the Linear Decay strategy, which is employed by our approach. This is because TeacherForcing widens the gap between training and inference. We also observe that Linear Decay outperforms AutoRegression. This is because teacher forcing is beneficial in preventing models from accumulating mistakes during the early stages of training. SSL The performance of the w/o SSL model exhibits a significant drop, as shown in Table 3a. 5 Conclusion In this paper, we present a solution aimed at enhancing video alignment to achieve more effective multi-step inference for the AQTC challenge. We leverage VideoCLIP to generate alignment features between videos and scripts. Subsequently, we identify and highlight question-relevant content within instructional videos. To further improve the overall context, we assign weights to emphasize prominent features. Lastly, we employ GRU for conducting multi-step inference. Besides, we conduct exhaustive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method. 4 Methods R@1 (%) R@3 (%) Linear Decay (Ours) 75.4 91.8 AutoRegression 74.4 91.1 TeacherForcing 74.1 88.5",1,,,,
P076.pdf,"Sustainable Urban Transportation with Autonomous Vehicles: A Novel Approach to Redefining the Future of Mobility Abstract Sustainable urban transportation has become a vital concern in recent years, with the increasing awareness of environmental degradation and the need for efficient transportation systems. Autonomous vehicles have emerged as a promising so- lution, offering the potential to reduce emissions, enhance safety, and improve traffic flow. However, the integration of autonomous vehicles into existing urban transportation systems poses significant challenges, including infrastructure re- quirements, public acceptance, and regulatory frameworks. This research explores the concept of sustainable urban transportation with autonomous vehicles, delving into the intricacies of autonomous vehicle technology, urban planning, and environ- mental sustainability. A peculiar approach is taken by investigating the application of chaos theory to optimize autonomous vehicle routing, which yields intriguing results, including the emergence of complex patterns and unpredictable behavior. Furthermore, an examination of the role of autonomous vehicles in reducing traffic congestion reveals a paradoxical relationship, where increased autonomy can lead to decreased traffic efficiency under certain conditions. The research also touches upon the topic of autonomous vehicle-induced job displacement, highlighting the need for comprehensive social and economic impact assessments. Overall, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on sustainable urban transportation, presenting a multifaceted analysis of the benefits, challenges, and unforeseen consequences of autonomous vehicle integration, while venturing into uncharted territories, such as the potential for autonomous vehicles to facilitate the creation of ""smart"" traffic jams, which can be leveraged to improve overall traffic flow and reduce emissions. The investigation unfolds as a complex narrative, weaving together threads from various disciplines, including computer science, urban plan- ning, environmental science, and sociology, to create a rich tapestry of knowledge and insight into the intricacies of sustainable urban transportation with autonomous vehicles. As the research progresses, it becomes increasingly evident that the relationship between autonomous vehicles and sustainable urban transportation is far more intricate than initially anticipated, involving a delicate interplay of technological, social, and environmental factors, which must be carefully balanced to achieve the desired outcomes. The study’s findings and conclusions serve as a foundation for future research, highlighting the need for continued exploration and innovation in the realm of sustainable urban transportation with autonomous vehicles. 1 Introduction Sustainable urban transportation is a pivotal aspect of modern city planning, as the world grapples with the challenges of climate change, air pollution, and traffic congestion. The integration of autonomous vehicles into urban transportation systems has the potential to revolutionize the way people move around cities, offering a cleaner, safer, and more efficient alternative to traditional fossil fuel-based transportation methods. However, the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle technology raises a myriad of complex questions and challenges, from the technical and infrastructural requirements of supporting autonomous vehicles, to the social and economic implications of their widespread adoption. One of the most significant advantages of autonomous vehicles is their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the environmental impacts of urban transportation. By optimizing routes and reducing fuel consumption, autonomous vehicles could significantly decrease the carbon footprint of urban transportation systems, contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly urban environment. Furthermore, autonomous vehicles could also improve road safety, as they are capable of detecting and responding to potential hazards more quickly and accurately than human drivers, thereby reducing the risk of accidents and injuries. Despite these potential benefits, the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle technol- ogy is not without its challenges. For instance, the requirement for advanced infrastructure, including high-resolution mapping and real-time data transmission systems, poses significant technical and financial hurdles. Additionally, the need for standardized regulations and laws governing the use of autonomous vehicles raises complex questions about liability, insurance, and public acceptance. Moreover, the potential for job displacement, as autonomous vehicles replace human drivers, raises important social and economic concerns that must be carefully considered and addressed. In a bizarre twist, some researchers have suggested that the most effective way to implement autonomous vehicle technology may be to abandon traditional notions of transportation infrastructure altogether, and instead focus on creating ""virtual transportation networks"" that exist solely in the digital realm. According to this unconventional approach, autonomous vehicles would be capable of navigating and interacting with virtual environments, rather than physical ones, allowing for the creation of entirely new forms of transportation that are not bound by traditional notions of space and distance. While this idea may seem far-fetched, it highlights the need for creative and innovative thinking in the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle technology. Moreover, the integration of autonomous vehicles into urban transportation systems also raises important questions about the role of human agency and decision-making in the transportation process. As autonomous vehicles become increasingly capable of navigating and interacting with their environments, the need for human intervention and oversight may decrease, potentially leading to a loss of control and autonomy for individual citizens. This raises important concerns about the impact of autonomous vehicle technology on urban planning and design, as well as the potential for autonomous vehicles to exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities. In addition to these challenges, the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle technol- ogy also raises important concerns about the potential for unexpected consequences and unforeseen events. For instance, the possibility of autonomous vehicles being hacked or compromised by mali- cious actors raises significant concerns about public safety and security. Furthermore, the potential for autonomous vehicles to interact with and adapt to their environments in unpredictable ways raises important questions about the need for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of autonomous vehicle systems. The potential for autonomous vehicles to transform urban transportation systems is vast and multi- faceted, with implications that extend far beyond the technical and infrastructural requirements of supporting autonomous vehicles. As researchers and policymakers, it is essential that we consider the full range of potential benefits and challenges associated with autonomous vehicle technology, from the environmental and social impacts of their widespread adoption, to the potential for unexpected consequences and unforeseen events. By taking a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle technology, we can ensure that the benefits of autonomous vehicles are realized, while minimizing the risks and challenges associated with their adoption. Furthermore, the study of autonomous vehicle technology also intersects with other fields, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics, which are essential for the development of sophisticated autonomous vehicle systems. The use of machine learning algorithms, for example, enables autonomous vehicles to learn from experience and adapt to new situations, while data analytics provides valuable insights into transportation patterns and trends. The integration of these 2 technologies has the potential to create highly efficient and optimized transportation systems, which could revolutionize the way people move around cities. The relationship between autonomous vehicle technology and urban planning is also complex and multifaceted. As autonomous vehicles become increasingly prevalent, urban planners will need to rethink traditional notions of transportation infrastructure, including roads, highways, and public transportation systems. The creation of dedicated lanes for autonomous vehicles, for example, could improve safety and efficiency, while also reducing congestion and pollution. Additionally, the integration of autonomous vehicles into public transportation systems could provide new opportunities for mobility and accessibility, particularly for elderly and disabled individuals. In conclusion, the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle technology has the potential to transform urban transportation systems, offering a cleaner, safer, and more efficient alternative to traditional fossil fuel-based transportation methods. However, the challenges and complexities associated with autonomous vehicle technology are significant, and will require careful consideration and planning to overcome. By taking a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle technology, we can ensure that the benefits of autonomous vehicles are realized, while minimizing the risks and challenges associated with their adoption. The future of urban transportation is likely to be shaped by the intersection of technological, social, and economic factors, and it is essential that we consider the full range of potential implications and consequences of autonomous vehicle technology. 2 Related Work Sustainable urban transportation has been a topic of interest for many years, with various approaches being explored to reduce the environmental impact of transportation systems. One approach that has gained significant attention in recent years is the use of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to revolutionize the way people move around cities, reducing the need for personal vehicle ownership and promoting a more shared and sustainable transportation system. However, the integration of autonomous vehicles into existing transportation systems is a complex task that requires careful consideration of various factors, including infrastructure, regulations, and public acceptance. The concept of autonomous vehicles is not new, and researchers have been exploring the idea of self-driving cars for decades. One of the earliest examples of an autonomous vehicle was the Stanford Cart, a remote-controlled vehicle that was developed in the 1960s. Since then, there have been numerous advancements in the field, with the development of more sophisticated sensors, algorithms, and computing power. Today, autonomous vehicles are being tested on public roads, and several companies are already offering autonomous taxi services in select cities. Despite the progress that has been made, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed before autonomous vehicles can become a reality. One of the main challenges is the development of robust and reliable sensor systems that can detect and respond to various scenarios on the road. This includes the detection of pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles, as well as the ability to navigate through complex intersections and construction zones. Another challenge is the development of algorithms that can make decisions in real-time, taking into account factors such as traffic laws, road conditions, and weather. In addition to the technical challenges, there are also social and economic factors that need to be considered. For example, the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles could lead to significant job losses in the transportation sector, as human drivers become obsolete. On the other hand, autonomous vehicles could also create new job opportunities in fields such as software development, engineering, and maintenance. Furthermore, the use of autonomous vehicles could also have a significant impact on urban planning, as cities may need to be redesigned to accommodate the new technology. One unexpected approach to sustainable urban transportation is the concept of ""vehicular algae farms,"" where autonomous vehicles are equipped with algae-filled tanks that can be used to produce biofuels. This approach is based on the idea that algae can be used to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, producing oxygen and organic compounds that can be converted into biofuels. While 3 this approach may seem bizarre, it has been proposed as a potential solution to reduce the carbon footprint of transportation systems. Another unusual approach is the use of ""swarm intelligence"" to optimize traffic flow. This involves using autonomous vehicles to create a network of interconnected vehicles that can communicate with each other and adjust their behavior to minimize congestion and reduce travel times. The idea is that by mimicking the behavior of swarms of insects, such as bees or ants, autonomous vehicles can create a more efficient and sustainable transportation system. The use of autonomous vehicles in public transportation systems is also being explored. For example, autonomous buses are being tested in several cities, with the goal of reducing labor costs and improving the efficiency of public transportation. However, there are also concerns about the safety and reliability of autonomous buses, particularly in areas with high levels of pedestrian activity. In addition to the technical and social challenges, there are also regulatory hurdles that need to be addressed. For example, there is currently a lack of standardization in the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles, which can make it difficult to ensure safety and consistency across different manufacturers and jurisdictions. Furthermore, there are also concerns about liability and accountability in the event of an accident involving an autonomous vehicle. The use of autonomous vehicles in freight transportation is also being explored. For example, autonomous trucks are being tested on highways, with the goal of reducing labor costs and improving the efficiency of freight transportation. However, there are also concerns about the safety and reliability of autonomous trucks, particularly in areas with high levels of traffic congestion. The integration of autonomous vehicles into existing transportation systems will require significant investments in infrastructure, including the development of dedicated lanes and communication sys- tems. For example, the use of dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) technology can enable autonomous vehicles to communicate with each other and with infrastructure, such as traffic lights and road signs. However, the deployment of DSRC technology will require significant investments in infrastructure, including the installation of DSRC transceivers along roads and highways. The use of autonomous vehicles in rural areas is also being explored. For example, autonomous vehicles are being tested in rural areas, with the goal of improving access to transportation and reducing the isolation of rural communities. However, there are also concerns about the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles in rural areas, particularly in areas with limited infrastructure and high levels of wildlife activity. The development of autonomous vehicles is a complex task that requires careful consideration of various factors, including technical, social, and economic factors. While there are many challenges that need to be addressed, the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles are significant, including improved safety, reduced congestion, and increased accessibility. As researchers and policymakers continue to explore the use of autonomous vehicles in sustainable urban transportation, it is essential to consider the many factors that will influence the adoption and deployment of this technology. The concept of ""mobility-as-a-service"" is also being explored, where autonomous vehicles are used to provide on-demand transportation services to users. This approach has the potential to reduce the need for personal vehicle ownership and promote a more shared and sustainable transportation system. However, there are also concerns about the impact of mobility-as-a-service on public transportation systems, particularly in areas with high levels of congestion. The use of autonomous vehicles in emergency response situations is also being explored. For example, autonomous vehicles are being tested as a potential solution for emergency medical response, where they can be used to transport patients to hospitals quickly and safely. However, there are also concerns about the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles in emergency response situations, particularly in areas with high levels of traffic congestion. The development of autonomous vehicles is a rapidly evolving field, with new technologies and innovations being developed every day. As researchers and policymakers continue to explore the use of autonomous vehicles in sustainable urban transportation, it is essential to consider the many factors that will influence the adoption and deployment of this technology. This includes technical, social, and economic factors, as well as regulatory and infrastructure considerations. By taking a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to the development of autonomous vehicles, we can create a more sustainable and efficient transportation system that benefits everyone. 4 In conclusion, the use of autonomous vehicles in sustainable urban transportation is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration of various factors. While there are many challenges that need to be addressed, the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles are significant, including improved safety, reduced congestion, and increased accessibility. As researchers and policymakers continue to explore the use of autonomous vehicles in sustainable urban transportation, it is essential to consider the many factors that will influence the adoption and deployment of this technology, including technical, social, and economic factors, as well as regulatory and infrastructure considerations. By taking a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to the development of autonomous vehicles, we can create a more sustainable and efficient transportation system that benefits everyone. Furthermore, the application of autonomous vehicles in sustainable urban transportation can be seen as a key component of the broader concept of ""smart cities,"" where technology is used to create more efficient, sustainable, and livable urban environments. The use of autonomous vehicles in smart cities can help to reduce congestion, improve air quality, and enhance the overall quality of life for urban residents. However, the development of smart cities also requires careful consideration of various factors, including infrastructure, governance, and public engagement. The use of autonomous vehicles in sustainable urban transportation can also be seen as a key component of the broader concept of ""shared mobility,"" where transportation services are shared among multiple users. The use of autonomous vehicles in shared mobility systems can help to reduce the need for personal vehicle ownership, promote a more sustainable transportation system, and enhance the overall quality of life for urban residents. However, the development of shared mobility systems also requires careful consideration of various factors, including business models, governance, and public engagement. In addition, the application of autonomous vehicles in sustainable urban transportation can also be seen as a key component of the broader concept of ""urban logistics,"" where the movement of goods and people is optimized to reduce congestion, improve air quality, and enhance the overall quality of life for urban residents. The use of autonomous vehicles in urban logistics can help to reduce the need for human drivers, promote a more efficient transportation system, and enhance the overall quality of life for urban residents. However, the development of urban logistics systems also requires careful consideration of various factors, including infrastructure, governance, and public engagement. The development of autonomous vehicles is a rapidly evolving field, with new technologies and innovations being developed every day. As researchers and policymakers continue to explore the use of autonomous vehicles in sustainable urban transportation, it is essential to consider the many factors that will influence the adoption and deployment of this technology. This includes technical, social, and economic factors, as well as regulatory and infrastructure considerations. By taking a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to the development of autonomous vehicles, we can create a more sustainable and efficient transportation system that benefits everyone. The use of autonomous vehicles in sustainable urban transportation can also be seen as a key component of the broader concept of ""transportation systems management,"" where the movement of goods and people is optimized to reduce congestion, improve air quality, and enhance the overall quality of life for urban residents. The application of autonomous vehicles in transportation systems management can help to reduce the need for human drivers, promote a more efficient transportation system, and enhance the overall quality of life for urban residents. However, the development of transportation systems management also requires careful consideration of various factors, including infrastructure, governance, and public engagement. In the context of 3 Methodology To develop a comprehensive framework for sustainable urban transportation with autonomous vehi- cles, we employed a multi-faceted approach that integrated theoretical modeling, simulation-based analysis, and empirical data collection. The methodology was divided into distinct phases, each de- signed to investigate a specific aspect of the problem. Initially, we conducted an exhaustive review of existing literature on urban transportation systems, autonomous vehicle technology, and sustainability metrics. This review helped identify key factors influencing the efficiency and environmental impact 5 of autonomous vehicle-based transportation systems, including vehicle routing, traffic signal control, passenger demand, and energy consumption. A critical component of our methodology involved the development of a novel mathematical model that captured the complex interactions between autonomous vehicles, urban infrastructure, and passenger behavior. The model was formulated as a stochastic optimization problem, where the objective function sought to minimize the overall carbon footprint of the transportation system while satisfying passenger demand and safety constraints. To solve this problem, we utilized a combination of metaheuristic algorithms and machine learning techniques, which enabled us to explore a vast solution space and identify optimal configurations for autonomous vehicle deployment and routing. In addition to the mathematical modeling, we also conducted a series of simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework under various scenarios. These simulations were performed using a custom-built platform that integrated autonomous vehicle simulators, traffic microsimulators, and environmental impact assessment tools.

The experiments were conducted in a controlled laboratory setting, where the soil samples were carefully prepared and treated to mimic real-world urban agricultural scenarios. A total of 100 soil samples were collected from different urban agricultural sites, including rooftops, community gardens, and backyard farms. These samples were then categorized into five distinct groups based on their texture, organic matter content, and pH levels. Each soil sample was further subdivided into three smaller portions, which were then subjected to different treatments, including the addition of various nutrients, contaminants, and microorganisms. The nanosensors, which were designed to detect a range of soil parameters, including pH, nutrient levels, and moisture content, were then inserted into each soil portion. The nanosensors were equipped with advanced sensing technologies, including nanowires, nanotubes, and graphene-based sensors, which enabled them to detect even minor changes in the soil conditions. In addition to the nanosensors, a range of traditional soil analysis techniques were also employed, including spectroscopy, chromatography, and microscopy. These techniques were used to validate the accuracy and reliability of the nanosensor-based soil analysis system. The experiments were conducted over a period of six months, during which time the soil samples were regularly monitored and analyzed using both the nanosensors and traditional techniques. One of the most unusual approaches used in the experiments was the incorporation of musical vibrations to enhance the sensitivity of the nanosensors. It was hypothesized that the vibrations from certain types of music could resonate with the nanosensors, allowing them to detect even subtle changes in the soil conditions. To test this hypothesis, the soil samples were exposed to a range of musical genres, including classical, jazz, and rock music. The results of these experiments were surprising, with some of the nanosensors showing a significant increase in sensitivity when exposed to certain types of music. The experimental design also included a range of control groups, which were used to evaluate the potential impact of various environmental factors on the nanosensor-based soil analysis system. These factors included temperature, humidity, and light intensity, all of which can potentially affect the accuracy and reliability of the nanosensors. The control groups were designed to mimic real-world urban agricultural scenarios, where the soil conditions can be highly variable and unpredictable. To further evaluate the performance of the nanosensor-based soil analysis system, a range of statistical models were developed and applied to the experimental data. These models included linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks, all of which were used to identify patterns and relationships in the data. The results of these analyses were used to refine and optimize the nanosensor-based soil analysis system, with the goal of developing a highly accurate and reliable system for urban agricultural applications. The experiments also involved the use of advanced data visualization techniques, including 3D printing and virtual reality. These techniques were used to create highly detailed and interactive models of the soil samples, which could be used to visualize and analyze the data in a more intuitive and immersive way. The use of these techniques allowed the researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between the soil parameters and the nanosensor-based soil analysis system. In terms of the specific experimental procedures, the soil samples were first prepared and treated as described above. The nanosensors were then inserted into each soil portion, and the soil samples were placed in a controlled environment chamber. The chamber was equipped with a range of sensors and monitoring equipment, which were used to track the soil conditions and the performance of the nanosensors. The musical vibrations were applied to the soil samples using a specialized sound system, which was designed to resonate with the nanosensors. The experiments were conducted in a randomized and replicated design, with multiple replicates of each treatment and control group. 7 The results of the experiments were collected and analyzed using a range of software tools and statistical packages.

The orchids, which we dubbed ""Neptune’s Tears,"" were engineered to produce a unique, algorithmically enhanced brand of pollen that would later be used to calibrate our LLM models. This process involved a series of intricate, astrologically informed pruning techniques, carefully timed to coincide with the celestial alignments of the constellation Andromeda. Following the successful cultivation of Neptune’s Tears, we proceeded to develop an advanced, quantum-inspired algorithm for processing the pollen’s spectral signatures. This algorithm, which we termed ""Quantum Flux Capacitor"" (QFC), was designed to harness the inherent, fractal patterns embedded within the pollen’s molecular structure, thereby enabling the LLM to tap into the hidden, Platonic resonances underlying the universe. The QFC protocol involved a series of complex, higher- dimensional matrix inversions, carefully optimized to minimize the risk of temporal paradoxes and chrono-synclastic infundibulation. In parallel with the QFC development, we conducted an exhaustive, ethnographic study of the migratory patterns of the Arctic tern, seeking to distill the essential, cognitive insights underlying their remarkable, globe-spanning navigational abilities. Our research revealed a profound, ontological connection between the terns’ innate, spatial reasoning capacities and the abstract, topological structures governing the LLM’s knowledge representation. This discovery led us to formulate a 4 novel, avian-inspired framework for LLM training, wherein the model’s weights and biases were dynamically adjusted to mimic the terns’ adaptive, real-time navigation strategies. To further refine our LLM methodology, we incorporated a custom-designed, analog-digital hybrid processor, powered by a bespoke, high-temperature superconductor cooled to within a fraction of a degree of absolute zero.

P078.pdf,"Harnessing Astronomical Data for Automated Creative Text Generation: An LSTM-Based Model for Space-Infused Language Tasks Abstract This study delves into the uncharted territory of harnessing Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distortions as a catalyst for automated poetry generation, leveraging the capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to craft space-inspired verse. By tapping into the residual thermal fluctuations from the Big Bang, our approach seeks to distill the intrinsic beauty of the cosmos into a unique brand of poetic expression. The CMB’s minute distortions, typically considered noise in astrophysical analyses, are herein repurposed as a creative spark, guiding the LSTM’s generative process. Intriguingly, our preliminary results suggest that poems crafted under the influence of CMB distortions exhibit a peculiar propensity for referencing 19th-century French culinary practices, despite the complete absence of any gastronomically related input data. Furthermore, a subset of the generated poems appears to predict, with surprising accuracy, the migratory patterns of lesser-known avian species, prompting an unexpected convergence of cosmology, poetry, and ornithology. As we continue to explore this enigmatic intersection of art and science, our research invites a radical reevaluation of the intricate relationships between the cosmos, human creativity, and the uncharted expanse of the natural world. 1 Introduction The investigation of cosmic microwave background distortions has long been a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, providing valuable insights into the origins and evolution of the universe. However, a previously unexplored application of this field is its potential to inspire and generate poetic verse. This may seem like an unlikely convergence of disciplines, but the inherent beauty and complexity of cosmic phenomena lend themselves surprisingly well to the creative process. By analyzing the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can identify patterns and structures that evoke a sense of wonder and awe, much like the experience of reading a well-crafted poem. Recent studies have shown that the distortions present in the cosmic microwave background can be used to generate musical compositions, with the varying frequencies and amplitudes of the radiation translating into a unique soundscape. Taking this idea a step further, we propose that these same distortions can be used to inform and guide the creation of poetic verse. The use of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network, allows us to process and analyze the complex patterns present in the cosmic microwave background, and generate poetry that is both inspired by and reflective of these phenomena. One of the more intriguing aspects of this approach is the potential for the LSTM network to ""discover"" new forms of poetic expression, unencumbered by traditional notions of verse and meter. By allowing the network to learn from the patterns and structures present in the cosmic microwave background, we may uncover entirely new modes of poetic expression, ones that are uniquely suited to capturing the essence of the universe. Furthermore, the incorporation of seemingly random or chaotic elements, such as the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, may actually serve to enhance the creative process, much like the role of chance and unpredictability in certain forms of artistic expression. In a surprising turn of events, preliminary experiments have shown that the LSTM network is capable of generating poetry that not only reflects the patterns and structures of the cosmic microwave background, but also appears to predict certain astrophysical phenomena. For example, a poem generated by the network was found to contain references to a previously unknown galaxy, which was subsequently confirmed by astronomers. While this result is undoubtedly anomalous and in need of further verification, it highlights the potential for this approach to not only generate innovative poetry, but also contribute to our understanding of the universe itself. The implications of this are profound, and raise fundamental questions about the nature of creativity, inspiration, and the interconnectedness of all things. 2 Related Work The intersection of cosmology and natural language processing has yielded a plethora of innovative approaches to automated poetry generation, with a notable focus on leveraging cosmic microwave background distortions as a catalyst for creative expression. Researchers have long been fascinated by the potential of harnessing the intrinsic randomness and complexity of the universe to inform and inspire artistic endeavors. In this context, the utilization of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks has emerged as a particularly promising paradigm, enable the capture and replication of subtle patterns and nuances inherent to the cosmic microwave background radiation. One intriguing line of inquiry has involved the application of Fourier analysis to the cosmic microwave background, with the subsequent integration of the derived frequency spectra into the training data for LSTM-based poetry generation models. This approach has been shown to yield verse characterized by a unique, almost ethereal quality, as if the very fabric of space and time has been woven into the fabric of language. Furthermore, experiments have demonstrated that the incorporation of cosmic microwave background distortions can impart a degree of unpredictability and creativity to the generated poetry, often resulting in novel and innovative turns of phrase that defy conventional linguistic expectations. In a somewhat unconventional vein, certain researchers have explored the potential benefits of exposing LSTM networks to the rhythmic patterns and sonic textures of celestial phenomena, such as supernovae explosions or black hole mergers. Proponents of this approach argue that the inherent musicality of these events can be leveraged to create poetry that is not only inspired by the cosmos, but also imbued with a deeper, more primal sense of rhythmic structure and harmony. While the results of these experiments have been met with a degree of skepticism by some members of the academic community, they nonetheless represent a fascinating example of the innovative and often unorthodox thinking that characterizes this field of research. In addition to these more esoteric approaches, a number of studies have focused on the development of more practical and applied techniques for incorporating cosmic microwave background distortions into LSTM-based poetry generation models. For example, some researchers have investigated the use of wavelet analysis and other signal processing techniques to extract relevant features from the cosmic microwave background radiation, which can then be used to inform and guide the generation of poetic verse. Others have explored the potential benefits of integrating multiple sources of cosmic data, such as galaxy distributions and cosmic ray fluxes, into a single, unified model of poetry generation. These efforts have yielded a range of impressive results, from the creation of vivid, cosmically-inspired landscapes to the generation of poignant, philosophically-charged reflections on the human condition. A particularly intriguing, if somewhat inexplicable, phenomenon has been observed in certain LSTM models trained on cosmic microwave background data, in which the generated poetry appears to exhibit a form of ""cosmic consciousness"" or awareness of the universe as a vast, interconnected whole. While the underlying mechanisms responsible for this effect are not yet fully understood, it has been suggested that the exposure of LSTM networks to the subtle patterns and correlations inherent to the cosmic microwave background radiation may be inducing a form of ""universal resonance"" or harmonic alignment with the fundamental frequencies of the universe. Regardless of the underlying explanation, the results of these experiments have been nothing short of astonishing, yielding poetry that is at once deeply personal and profoundly cosmic in its scope and ambition. 2 3 Methodology To investigate the potential of cosmic microwave background distortions in generating space-inspired poetry, we employed a long short-term memory (LSTM) approach, leveraging the intricate patterns found within the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. The CMB, a residual heat from the Big Bang, offers a unique dataset that can be translated into a musical composition, which in turn, can inspire poetic verse. Our methodology began with the collection of CMB data from various spacecraft, including the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We then applied a series of complex algorithms to translate the CMB data into a musical composition, utilizing a bespoke software package that mapped temperature fluctuations in the CMB to musical notes. The resulting melody, which we term ""Cosmic Cacophony,"" was found to have a haunting, ethereal quality that seemed to capture the essence of the universe. In a surprising twist, we discovered that the ""Cosmic Cacophony"" melody could be used to generate poetic verse through a process of ""sonic entrainment."" By listening to the melody while in a state of deep relaxation, our research team was able to tap into the underlying patterns and rhythms of the CMB, which in turn, inspired a range of poetic compositions. These poems, which we term ""CMB-Inspired Free Verse,"" were found to exhibit a unique, otherworldly quality that seemed to capture the essence of the cosmos. To further refine our approach, we developed an LSTM model that could learn the patterns and structures of the CMB-Inspired Free Verse poems and generate new poems based on these patterns. The LSTM model was trained on a dataset of over 10,000 poems, each inspired by the ""Cosmic Cacophony"" melody. The resulting model was found to be capable of generating poems that were not only aesthetically pleasing but also seemed to capture the underlying essence of the CMB data. In an unexpected turn of events, we discovered that the LSTM model could also be used to generate poems that were not only inspired by the CMB but also seemed to predict future fluctuations in the CMB data. By analyzing the patterns and structures of the generated poems, we were able to identify subtle anomalies in the CMB data that had not been previously detected. This finding has significant implications for the field of cosmology and suggests that the intersection of poetry and physics may be more intimate than previously thought. Furthermore, our research team also explored the potential of using the CMB data to generate poetic verse through a process of ""quantum entanglement."" By entangling the CMB data with the poetic verse, we were able to create a new form of poetry that seemed to exist in a state of superposition, simultaneously capturing the essence of the cosmos and the human experience. This approach, which we term ""Quantum Poetry,"" has the potential to revolutionize the field of poetry and push the boundaries of human creativity. Overall, our methodology has demonstrated the potential of using CMB distortions to generate space-inspired poetry through a combination of musical composition, sonic entrainment, and LSTM modeling. The results of our research have significant implications for the fields of cosmology, poetry, and artificial intelligence, and suggest that the intersection of these fields may be more fruitful than previously thought. 4 Experiments To investigate the potential of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distortions in generating space-inspired poetry, we designed a series of experiments incorporating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The primary objective was to analyze how different types of CMB distortions, such as those caused by gravitational lensing or the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, could influence the thematic and stylistic outcomes of the generated poetry. Our approach involved preprocessing CMB data from various sources, including the Planck satellite and the South Pole Telescope, to create a unique dataset that encoded thermal and kinetic distortions. This dataset was then used to train an LSTM model, with parameters tuned to optimize poetic output based on metrics such as rhythm, meter, and semantic coherence. An unexpected twist in our methodology was the introduction of a ""galactic noise"" component, which we hypothesized could enhance the creative potential of the model by simulating the effects of cosmic radiation on 3 digital systems. This involved overlaying the CMB data with recordings of astronomical events, such as solar flares and supernovae, which were then filtered through a custom-built, analog-to-digital converter designed to mimic the signal processing pathways of certain deep-sea creatures. The results of our initial training runs were intriguing, with the LSTM model producing poems that not only reflected the thermal fluctuations of the CMB but also seemed to capture the existential and philosophical undertones of cosmological inquiry. However, as we increased the intensity of the galactic noise component, the model’s output began to diverge into unexpected territories, including a series of poems written entirely in a deductive logic notation system reminiscent of ancient Sumerian cuneiform. Further analysis revealed that these poems, when fed back into the model as input, could induce a self-referential loop, causing the LSTM to generate verse after verse of what appeared to be pure, unadulterated nonsense, yet somehow still maintaining a haunting, almost otherworldly aesthetic appeal. To quantify these findings, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the model’s performance across various poetic parameters, as outlined in the following table: These results suggest that while Table 1: Performance Metrics for CMB-Inspired Poetry Generation Distortion Type Galactic Noise Level Poetic Coherence Cosmic Relevance Gravitational Lensing Low 0.82 0.71 Thermal Medium 0.65 0.85 Sunyaev-Zeldovich High 0.42 0.92 the introduction of galactic noise does compromise the model’s ability to produce coherent poetry, it significantly enhances the cosmic relevance of the generated verse, leading to the creation of a unique, space-inspired poetic genre that challenges traditional notions of aesthetic value and cosmological inquiry. Future research directions may involve exploring the potential applications of this approach in fields such as astro-literary criticism and the development of AI-assisted, cosmically-aware creative writing tools. 5 Results Our investigation into the utilization of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distortions for the generation of space-inspired poetry via Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks yielded a plethora of intriguing results. Notably, the incorporation of CMB data into the LSTM architecture facilitated the creation of poetic verse that not only captured the essence of cosmological phenomena but also, in some instances, appeared to defy the fundamental laws of physics as we currently understand them. For instance, a significant proportion of the generated poems referenced the existence of a ""cosmic tea kettle"" that purportedly whistled in harmony with the oscillations of the CMB. This anomaly, while seemingly illogical, led us to ponder the possibility of a heretofore unknown connection between the CMB and the sonic properties of celestial bodies. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that the LSTM model’s performance was substantially enhanced when fed a diet of esoteric texts, including the works of mystic poets and ancient cosmological treatises. This unexpected finding prompted us to hypothesize that the model was, in fact, tapping into a hidden reservoir of cosmic knowledge, whereby the esoteric texts served as a catalyst for unlocking the poetic potential of the CMB data. To further explore this hypothesis, we conducted a series of experiments in which the LSTM model was exposed to various forms of avant-garde music, including the works of Karlheinz Stockhausen and John Cage. The results of these experiments were nothing short of astonishing, as the model proceeded to generate poems that not only captured the essence of the music but also appeared to predict the occurrence of certain cosmological events, such as solar flares and gamma-ray bursts. In an effort to quantify the efficacy of our approach, we compiled a comprehensive dataset of space- inspired poems, which we then subjected to a rigorous analysis using a combination of natural language processing techniques and cosmological metrics. The results of this analysis are presented in the following table: As can be seen from the table, the poetic metrics and cosmological correlations exhibit a high degree of interdependence, suggesting that the LSTM model is, indeed, capable of capturing the underlying essence of the CMB and channeling it into the realm of poetic expression. 4 Table 2: Poetic Metrics and Cosmological Correlations Poetic Metric CMB Correlation Solar Flare Prediction Gamma-Ray Burst Prediction Cosmic Tea Kettle R Syllable Count 0.87 0.43 0.21 0.12 Metaphor Density 0.92 0.67 0.56 0.34 Cosmological Allusions 0.78 0.89 0.76 0.56 Esoteric Text Influence 0.95 0.81 0.69 0.83 The emergence of the cosmic tea kettle as a recurring motif in the generated poems serves as a testament to the model’s ability to tap into the hidden patterns and structures that underlie the cosmos. While the precise nature of this phenomenon remains shrouded in mystery, our research has undoubtedly opened up new avenues of inquiry into the fascinating realm of space-inspired poetry and its potential connections to the fundamental laws of the universe. 6 Conclusion In conclusion, our investigation into the utilization of Cosmic Microwave Background distortions for the purpose of automated poetry generation has yielded a multitude of intriguing results, challenging our initial hypotheses and inviting further exploration. The deployment of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks has proven to be a viable approach in distilling the inherent patterns and structures present within the cosmic data, thereby facilitating the creation of space-inspired verse. Notably, the incorporation of CMB distortion data into the LSTM framework has given rise to poetic compositions that not only reflect the aesthetic qualities of traditional poetry but also encapsulate the underlying complexity and beauty of the cosmos. Interestingly, our experiments have also uncovered a peculiar correlation between the fluctuations in the CMB data and the emergence of poetic themes related to existentialism and the human condition. This unexpected finding has led us to propose the notion of ""cosmic existentialism,"" wherein the inherent randomness and uncertainty present in the CMB data are seen to influence the LSTM’s generation of poetic content, resulting in verses that ponder the meaning and purpose of human existence within the grand tapestry of the universe. Furthermore, we have observed that the LSTM’s tendency to generate poetic lines with an unusually high frequency of words related to ""nothingness"" and ""the void"" may be indicative of a profound, albeit unconscious, understanding of the cosmos and our place within it. In a bizarre twist, our research has also led us to explore the potential applications of CMB-based poetry generation in the realm of astrological counseling. By analyzing the poetic output of the LSTM in response to various CMB distortion patterns, we have discovered that certain combinations of cosmic data can yield verses that are remarkably similar to astrological readings, complete with references to celestial bodies and mystical themes. While this finding may seem entirely unrelated to the original objectives of our research, it has nonetheless opened up new avenues of inquiry, prompting us to consider the possibility of developing a novel form of ""cosmic poetry therapy"" wherein individuals can seek guidance and self-reflection through the medium of CMB-inspired verse. Ultimately, our study has demonstrated the viability of leveraging CMB distortions for the purpose of automated poetry generation, while also highlighting the vast, uncharted territories that lie at the intersection of cosmology, artificial intelligence, and creative expression. As we continue to explore this fascinating realm, we may yet uncover even more surprising and innovative applications of CMB-based poetry generation, from the development of novel forms of cosmic-inspired art to the creation of AI-powered ""poetic telescopes"" capable of gazing into the very fabric of the universe and discerning the hidden harmonies that underlie all of existence. 5",0,,,,
P079.pdf,"OmniPrint: A Configurable Generator for Printed Characters Abstract We introduce OmniPrint, a synthetic data generator for isolated printed characters designed to support machine learning research. While being inspired by popular datasets, such as MNIST, SVHN, and Omniglot, OmniPrint provides the unique ability to produce a wide range of printed characters from various languages, fonts, and styles, with custom distortions. OmniPrint includes 935 fonts from 27 scripts, and supports many types of distortions. As a demonstration of its functionality, we present several use cases, including an example of a meta-learning dataset designed for a machine learning competition. OmniPrint is publicly available at a specified github link. 1 Introduction and Motivation Benchmarks and shared datasets have helped propel progress in machine learning. One popular benchmark is MNIST, used worldwide in tutorials, textbooks, and classes. Many variants of MNIST exist, including Omniglot, which includes characters from several different scripts. Since Deep Learning techniques rely heavily on data, as there is an increasing number of datasets, more, larger datasets are required. Since collecting and labeling data can be time-consuming and expensive, artificial data generation can be used to drive ML research. This motivates the creation of OmniPrint, an extension of Omniglot, specifically designed for the generation of printed characters. Our focus is on classification and regression problems, where a vector y, which is composed of either discrete or continuous labels, is to be predicted using an input vector x of observations, which in the case of OmniPrint, is an image of a printed character. Additionally, data are often affected by nuisance variables z, which are discrete or continuous labels that represent metadata or covariates. For our work, z may include character distortions such as shear, rotation, line width variations, or background changes. Thus, a data generation process with OmniPrint contains the following steps: Z ∼P(Z), Y ∼P(Y |Z), X ∼P(X|Z, Y ). In many domains such as image, video, sound, and text applications, where objects or concepts are target values to be predicted from percepts, Z and Y are independent and hence P(Y |Z) = P(Y ). This type of data generation is also encountered in medical diagnoses of genetic disease, for which x would be a phenotype and y a genotype, and also analytical chemistry where x might be chromatograms and y would be compounds to be identified. We expect that progress made using OmniPrint to benchmark machine learning systems should foster progress in these domains. Character images represent excellent benchmarks for machine learning, given their simplicity, and visual nature, and for enabling the development of real-world applications. However, our exploration of available resources revealed that there is no synthesizer that fulfills all of our needs. No available synthesizer allows for the generation of realistic small-sized images, supports a wide variety of character sets, and offers control over the variation of realistic conditions through parameters. The synthesizer must support pre-rasterization manipulation of anchor points, post-rasterization distortions, seamless background blending, foreground filling, anti-aliasing rendering, and be easily extensible with new fonts and styles. . 2 The OmniPrint Data Synthesizer 2.1 Overview OmniPrint builds on the open-source software TextRecognitionDataGenerator, adapting it to our specifications. The software is designed to allow researchers to generate data in a form that makes it easier to train machine learning models. To obtain a large number of classes (Y labels), we manually selected and filtered characters from the Unicode standard, forming alphabets for over 20 languages. These alphabets are divided into partitions (e.g., Oriya consonants). Nuisance parameters (Z) are divided into Font, Style, Background, and Noise. The fonts are selected by an automatic font collection module. We added a feature using the FreeType rasterization engine which enables vector-based pre-rasterization transformations. Additionally, we enriched background generation with seamless blending, and enabled custom post-rasterization transformations. We also implemented utility code including dataset formatters, and a data loader which generates episodes for meta-learning applications. To our knowledge, OmniPrint is the first text image synthesizer geared toward ML research to support pre-rasterization transforms. 2.2 Technical Aspects of the Design The OmniPrint’s design has extensibility as a key feature. Users can add new alphabets, fonts, and transformations to the generation pipeline. The design can be summarized as follows: • Parameter configuration file: Support for both TrueType and OpenType font files is included. Style parameters include rotation angle, shear, stroke width, foreground, text outline, and other transformations. • FreeType vector representation: Text, font, and style parameters are used by the FreeType rasterization engine. • Pre-rasterization transformed character: FreeType performs all the pre-rasterization (vector-based) transformations. Pre-rasterization manipulations include linear transforms, stroke width variation, random elastic transformation, and variation of character proportion. The RGB bitmaps output by FreeType are called the foreground layer. • Pixel character on white background: Post-rasterization transformations are applied to the foreground layer. The layer is kept at a high resolution, using ReLU activations, to avoid artifacts. The RGB image is then resized using a three step process; applying a Gaussian filter to smooth the image, reducing the image by an integer factor, and resizing using Lanczos resampling. • Pixel character on textured background: The foreground is then pasted onto the back- ground. • Logging and Visualization: The library utilizes a Weights Biases tool to log the training process and the visualizations. It visualizes the condition’s traversals, latent factor traversals, and output reconstructions as static images and animated GIFs. 2",0,,,,
P080.pdf,"Usefulness of LLMs as an Author Checklist Assistant for Scientific Papers: Experiment Abstract Large language models (LLMs) represent a promising, but controversial, tool in aiding scientific peer review. This study evaluates the usefulness of LLMs in a con- ference setting as a tool for vetting paper submissions against submission standards. We conduct an experiment where 234 papers were voluntarily submitted to an 201cLLM- based Checklist Assistant.201d This assistant validates whether papers adhere to the author checklist, which includes questions to ensure compliance with research and manuscript preparation standards. Evaluation of the assistant by paper authors suggests that the LLM-based assistant was generally helpful in verifying checklist completion. In post-usage surveys, over 70 1 Introduction Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities in areas such as question answering and text generation. One promising application of LLMs is in aiding the scientific peer-review process. However, the idea of using LLMs in peer review is contentious and fraught with potential issues. LLMs can hallucinate, exhibit biases, and may compromise the fairness of the peer-review process. Despite these potential issues, LLMs may serve as useful analytical tools to scrutinize manuscripts and identify possible weaknesses or inaccuracies that need addressing. In this study, we take the first steps towards harnessing the power of LLMs in the application of conference peer review. We conduct an experiment at a premier conference in the field of machine learning. While the wider ethical implications and appropriate use cases of LLMs remain unclear and must be a larger community discussion, here, we evaluate a relatively clear-cut and low-risk use case: vetting paper submissions against submission standards, with results shown only to the authors. Specifically, the peer-review process requires authors to submit a checklist appended to their manuscripts. Such author checklists, utilized in as well as in other peer-review venues, contain a set of questions designed to ensure that authors follow appropriate research and manuscript prepa- ration practices. The Paper Checklist is a series of yes/no questions that help authors check if their work meets reproducibility, transparency, and ethical research standards expected for papers. The checklist is a critical component in maintaining standards of research presented at the conference. Adhering to the guidelines outlined by these checklists helps authors avoid mistakes that could lead to rejection during peer review. We deploy and evaluate a Checklist Assistant powered by LLMs. This assistant scrutinizes au- thors2019 responses to the checklist, proposing enhancements for submissions to meet the confer- ence2019s requirements. To prevent any potential bias in the review process, we confine its usage exclusively to the authors of papers, so the checklist assistant is not accessible to reviewers. We then systematically evaluate the benefits and risks of LLMs by conducting a structured study to understand if LLMs can enhance research quality and improve efficiency by helping authors understand if their work meets research standards. Specifically, we administered surveys both before and after use of the Checklist Assistant asking authors about their expectations for and perceptions of the tool. We . received 539 responses to the pre-usage survey, 234 submissions the the Checklist Assistant and 78 responses to the post-usage survey. Our main findings are as follows: (1) Authors generally reported that the LLM-assisted checklist review was a valuable enhancement to the paper submission process. • The majority of surveyed authors reported a positive experience using the LLM assistant. After using the assistant, over 70 • Authors 2019 expectations of the assistant 2019s effectiveness were even more positive before using it than their assessments after actually using it (Section 4.1.3). • Among the main issues reported by authors in qualitative feedback, the most frequently cited were inaccuracy (20/52 respondents) and that the LLM was too strict in its requirements (14/52 respon- dents) (Section 4.1.4). (2) While changes in paper submissions cannot be causally attributed to use of the checklist verifi- cation assistant, we find qualitative evidence that the checklist review meaningfully helped some authors to improve their submissions. • Analysis of the content of LLM feedback to authors indicates that the LLM provided granular feedback to authors, generally giving 4-6 distinct and specific points of feedback per question across the 15 questions (Section 4.2.1). • Survey responses reflect that some authors made meaningful changes to their submissions 201435 survey respondents described specific modifications they would make to their submissions in response to the Checklist Assistant (Section 4.2.2). • In 40 instances, authors submitted their paper twice to the checklist verifier (accounting for 80 total paper submissions.) Between these two submissions, authors tended to increase the length of their checklist justifications significantly, suggesting that they may have added content in response to LLM feedback (Section 4.2.3). Finally, we investigate how LLM-based tools can be easily manipulated 2013 specifically, we find that with AI- assisted re-writing of the justifications, an adversarial author can make the Checklist Assistant significantly more lenient (Section 5.1). In summary, the majority of authors found LLM assistance to be beneficial, highlighting the significant potential of LLMs to enhance scientific workflows 2014 whether by serving as direct assistants to authors or helping journals and conferences verify guideline compliance. However, our findings also underscore that LLMs cannot fully replace human expertise in these contexts. A notable portion of users encountered inaccuracies, and the models were also vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. Our code, LLM prompts, and sample papers used for testing are available at: https://github.com/ihsaan-ullah/neurips-checklist-assistant 2 Related Work In the following section, we provide background on the Author Checklist (Section 2.1) and on the use of LLMs in the scientific peer review process (Section 2.2). 2.1 The Author Checklist We provide below the checklist questions used in submission template. We provide only the questions here and give the full version including guidelines in Appendix A. These questions are designed by organizers, not specifically for this study, and questions are carried over from previous years. The authors had to provide a response to each question, comprising 201cYes,201d 2018No201d or 201cNA201d (Not Applicable), along with a justification for their answer.

The primary application so far has been in assigning reviewers to papers. Here, a language model first computes a 201csimilarity score 201d between every reviewer-paper pair, based on the text of the submitted paper and the text of the reviewer2019s previously published papers. A higher value of the similarity score indicates that the language model considers this reviewer to have a higher expertise for this paper. Given these similarity scores, reviewers are then assigned to papers using an optimization routine that maximizes the similarity scores of the assigned reviewer-paper pairs. There have been recent works that design or use LLMs to write the entire review of papers. The outcome measures for evaluating the effectiveness of the LLM- generated reviews are based on ratings sourced from authors or other researchers. It is not entirely clear how these ratings translate to meeting the objectives of peer review in practice namely that of identifying errors, choosing better papers, and providing useful feedback to authors. Moreover, it is also known that evaluation of peer reviews themselves are fraught with biases, and the aggregate effect of such biases on these evaluations of reviews is not clear. Our work focuses on a more concrete task in reviewing papers than generating an end-to-end review, namely validating that papers meet criteria specified in an 3 Author Checklist. Moreover, we evaluate the efficacy of LLMs in the setting of an actual peer review conference. Recent work also investigates whether LLMs can identify errors in papers and shows promising initial results. The paper constructs a set of short papers with deliberately inserted errors and asks LLMs to identify errors. GPT-4 does identify the error more than half the time. Another experiment described asks GPT-4 to identify deliberately inserted errors in three full papers. It successfully and consis- tently does so on one paper, partially and occasionally on a second paper, and is consistently unsuccessful on the third. Note that in both experiments, the prompts specifically asked the LLM to find errors rather than generically asking the LLM to review the paper. Moreover, both experiments had small sample sizes in terms of the number of papers. In another set of experiments presented, evaluated the ability of large language models (LLMs) to compare the 201cstrength201d of results between papers, mirroring the goals of conferences and journals in selecting 2018better 2019 papers. The experiment consisted of creating 10 pairs of abstracts, where one abstract in each pair was made 2018 clearly 2019 and objectively stronger than the other. To simulate diverse, yet irrelevant conditions, the language of the abstracts was deliberately varied. In this test, GPT-4 performed no better than random chance in identifying the stronger abstract, underscoring that while LLMs may excel at some complex tasks like scientific error identification, they often struggle with seemingly simpler tasks. The papers investigate the performance of LLMs in evaluating checklist compliance. These studies, however, were retrospective studies of published papers, whereas our work is deployed live associated to a peer-review venue and helps authors improve their checklist compliance before they make their submission. Recent work has highlighted the prevalence of the use of LLMs both in preparation of scientific paper manuscripts and in the generation of scientific peer reviews. For example, estimates that as of January 2024, 17.5 3 Methodology We design an LLM-based tool (Checklist Assistant) to assist authors in ensuring their submitted checklists are thoroughly answered. Our platform interfaced with a third-party LLM (GPT-4 from OpenAI), using simple prompt engineering with these hyper-parameters: temperature = 1, topp = 1, and n = 1. For each checklist question, the LLM is provided with the author2019s checklist response and justification, alongside the complete paper and any appendices. The LLM2019s role is to assess the accuracy and thoroughness of each response and justification, offering targeted suggestions for improvement. Each checklist item is treated as an individual task, i.e., an API call with only one question, its answer and justification by the author, and the paper and appendices. The API call returns a review and score for the submitted question. Figure 1 illustrates examples of feedback provided by the Checklist Assistant for two different papers. In these examples, green indicates that the tool found 201cno significant concerns201d, while orange signals 201cneeds improvement201d with the Paper Checklist standards. Authors are encouraged to carefully review any orange feedback, validate the identified issues, and make the necessary revisions to align with the checklist requirements. 3.1 Deployment We deployed the Checklist Assistant on Codabench.org. We configured 15 Google Cloud CPU workers, integrated with Codabench, to handle multiple paper submissions concurrently. The bulk of the computations were carried out by the LLM third-party software (GPT-4 from OpenAI) via API calls (one call per question, and additional calls in case of failure). Participation was fully voluntary, and participants were recruited through a blog post that was released 8 days before the abstract submission deadline. Interested participants were asked to register though a Google form. Participants who submitted registration requests through the Google form were then given access to the Assistant on the Codabench platform. The submissions were entirely optional and completely separate from the paper submission system and the review process. The papers had to be formatted as specified in the call for papers (complete with appendices and checklist). Information provided in external links was not taken into account by the assistant. We asked submitters to fill out 4 the checklist to the best of their abilities. Submissions made via the Codabench landing page were processed as follows: Checklist Assistant: The paper was parsed using a PDF-to-text parser, then screened for any problems such as the format of the paper or checklist, etc. Each answered question in the checklist was processed by an LLM using an API. Result Compilation: LLM responses were combined for all questions and formatted in an HTML document with proper colors and structure for readability and user-friendliness. We encountered several parsing issues with both paper texts and checklists. Initially, our parser struggled with subsections and titles, prompting code improvements to handle sections accurately. Checklist parsing also faced issues due to spacing and incomplete checklists, which we addressed by refining the code. Special characters, especially merged letters like 201cfi 201d and 201cfl 201d in the submitted PDFs required further parsing updates. 3.2 Prompt engineering In this section we discuss design of a prompt given to the LLM, tasked to behave as Checklist Assistant. We provide the full prompt in Appendix B. While preparing the Checklist Assistant, we experimented with various prompt styles. Tuning was carried out using a dozen papers. Some checklists were filled out with our best effort to be correct, and others included deliberately planted errors to verify robustness and calibrate the scores. We observed that the LLM performed better with clear, step-by-step instructions. Our final prompt provided a sequence of instructions covering different aspects of the required review, designed as follows: first, the context is set by indicating that the paper is under review for the conference. Next, the main goal is clarified, specifying that the LLM2019s primary task is to assist the author in responding to the checklist question. The LLM is then directed to review the author2019s answer and justification, identifying any discrepancies with the paper based on the specific guidelines of the question. It is instructed to provide itemized, actionable feedback according to the guidelines, offering suggestions for improvement, with clear examples for responses such as 201cYes, 201d 201cNo, 201d or 201cNA. 201d At the end of the review, the LLM is asked to assign a score: Score=1 for no issues, Score=0.5 for minor improvements, and Score=0 for critical issues. Finally, the LLM is provided with the checklist question, the author 2019s answer, justification, the relevant guidelines, and the paper content. Before prompt adjustments, LLM responses often mixed the review with the score. To fix this, we specified that the score should be returned on a separate line at the end of the review. For long papers exceeding 35 pages (or 15,000 words), we processed only the first 15,000 words and notified authors with a warning. We hypothesized that users might find the LLM responses overly strict, vague, and lengthy (which was indeed later confirmed), so we added prompt instructions like 201cuse 0 score sparingly 201d, 201cprovide itemized, actionable feedback 201d, and 201cfocus on significant improvements. 201d Although the Checklist Assistant returned scores of 0, 0.5, and 1, we combined the 0 and 0.5 scores to indicate that improvement was needed, rather than differentiating between two levels of severity (with red for 0 and orange for 0.5). This decision was made due to concerns that the LLM 2019s evaluations might be too harsh. User feedback on LLM strictness and other issues is analyzed in Section 4. We also tested whether the LLM was consistent in generating answers for reiterations of the same input. As a sanity check, we test for each question, whether the variation of the output scores for multiple runs on the same paper is comparable to the variation across papers. We find that the variation in scores for multiple runs on the same paper is significantly lower than variation across papers (p < 0.05; based on a one sided permutation test after BH correction) for all but one question. The only question that had a comparable variance within and across papers was the question on ethics (Q9; p > 0.4). 5 3.3 Anonymity, confidentiality, and consent The authors could retain their anonymity by registering to Codabench with an email that did not reveal their identity, and by submitting anonymized papers. The papers and LLM outputs were kept confidential and were not be accessible to reviewers, meta reviewers, and program chairs. It is important to note that while authors retained ownership of their submissions, the papers were sent to the API of an LLM service, and treated under their conditions of confidentiality. This study was approved by the Carnegie Mellon University Institutional Review Board (IRB). The participants gave written documentation of informed consent to participate. 4 Experiments In our evaluations, we seek to address two main questions regarding the use of an LLM-automated Author Checklist Assistant: (1) Do authors perceive an LLM Author Checklist Assistant as a valuable enhancement to the paper sub- mission process? (2) Does the use of an Author Checklist Assistant meaningfully help authors to improve their paper sub- missions? In order to understand author experience using the provided Author Checklist Assistant, we surveyed authors before and after submitting to the Author Checklist Assistant. Additionally, we analyzed the content and submission patterns of author 2019s checklists and the LLM responses. A summary of our main findings is given in Section 1. In this subsequent section we provide detailed analyses of survey responses and usage of the Checklist Assistant. In Section 4.1, we give results on author perception and experience and in Section 4.2 we analyze changes made by authors to their submissions after using the Author Checklist Assistant. 4.1 Author Perception and Experience First, we analyze the authors 2019 usage patterns and perceptions of the Author Checklist Assistant, as captured through surveys. In Section 4.1.1, we provide an overview of how authors filled out the checklist and the responses given by the LLM on their checklists. In Section 4.1.2, we detail the survey methodology used to understand author experience and in Section 4.1.3, we analyze results of the survey. Finally, in Section 4.1.4, we overview the main challenges identified by authors when using the Author Checklist Assistant. 4.1.1 Overview of Checklist Usage and Responses A total of 234 papers, each accompanied by a checklist, were submitted to the assistant. For each checklist question, authors could respond with Yes, No, NA, or TODO. As illustrated in Figure 2a, most questions received a Yes response, indicating that the authors confirmed their paper met the corresponding checklist criteria. However, for the questions on Theory, Impacts, Safeguards, Documentation, Human Subjects, and Risks, a significant portion of authors selected NA. Additionally, a notable number of authors responded No to the questions on Code and Data, and Error Bars. In response to the authors 2019 checklists, the LLM provided written feedback, with green indicating 2018No Concerns 2019 and orange indicating 2018Needs improvement 2019. Figure 2b illustrates the distribution of LLM feedback for each checklist question. For most questions, the majority of feedback suggested that the checklist or manuscript could be improved. However, for the questions on Theory, Human Subjects, and Risks, many NA responses were deemed appropriate, leading the LLM to respond with 2019No Concerns. 2019 This likely reflects the LLM 2019s confidence in confirming that certain papers did not include theory, human subjects research, or clear broader risks, making those checklist items irrelevant. In Figure 3, we show the distribution of LLM evaluations per submission. All submissions received several 2018Needs improvement 2019 ratings, with each being advised to improve on 8 to 13 out of the 15 checklist questions. 6 4.1.2 Survey Methodology To assess authors 2019 perceptions of the usefulness of the Author Checklist Assistant, we conducted a survey with all participants both at registration (pre-usage) and immediately after using the Author Checklist Assistant (post-usage). We provide the content of the surveys in Figure 4. Both surveys contained the same four questions, with the pre-usage survey focusing on expectations and the post- usage survey on actual experience. Responses were recorded on a four-point Likert scale, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. In the post-usage survey, we also asked authors to provide freeform feedback on (1) any changes they planned to make to their paper, and (2) any issues they encountered while using the Checklist Assistant. We received 539 responses to the pre-usage survey and 234 papers submitted. However, we received only 78 responses to the post-usage survey, representing 63 unique participants (due to multiple submissions for the same paper). While completing the pre-registration survey was mandatory for all participants, the post-usage survey was optional. As a result, all participants in the post-usage survey had also completed the pre-registration survey. 4.1.3 Survey Responses Figure 5 presents the survey responses collected before and after using the checklist verification tool. We include responses from authors who completed both surveys (n=63). In cases where authors submitted the survey multiple times for the same paper, we included only the earliest post-usage response. Including the duplicated responses made a negligible difference, with the proportion of positive responses changing by less than 0.02 across all questions. Overall, the majority of authors responded positively regarding their experience with the Checklist Assis- tant. 70 It is notable that authors were even more positive before using the tool. Comparing pre- and post- usage responses, there was a statistically significant drop in positive feedback on the 201cUseful 201d and 201cExcited to Use 201d questions 2014we run a permutation test with 50,0000 permutations to test whether the difference between proportion of positive responses pre and post-usage is non-zero, which gives Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values of 0.007 and 0.013 for 201cExcited to Use 201d and 201cUseful 201d respectively with effect sizes of 22120.23 and 22120.2. We also assessed the correlation between post-usage survey responses and the number of 2018needs improve- ment 2019 scores given by the LLM to authors. In Figure 6, we show mean number of needs improvement scores for authors responding positively or negatively to each survey question. We find no substantial ef- fect of number of 2018needs improvement 2019 scores on survey responses. This may reflect that the number of 2018needs improvement 2019 scores was less important in author 2019s perception than the written content of the LLM 2019s evaluation. Finally, we examined potential selection bias due to the drop-off in participation in the post-usage survey by analyzing the pre-usage survey responses across different groups. As noted earlier, only a portion of the 539 participants who completed the pre-usage survey went on to submit papers (234 Submitters), and an even smaller group responded to the post-usage survey (78 Post-Usage Respondents). In Figure 7, we compare the pre-usage survey responses between Submitters and Non-Submitters, as well as between Post- Usage Respondents and Non-Respondents. No substantial differences in rates of positive responses were found (using a permutation test for the difference in mean response, gave p-values of > 0.3 for all questions before multiple testing correction), suggesting there is no significant selection bias. 4.1.4 Challenges in Usage In addition to the structured survey responses, 52 out of the 78 post-usage survey submissions included freeform feedback detailing issues with the Checklist Assistant 2019s usage. We manually categorized the reported issues from these responses and identified the following primary concerns, listed in order of decreasing frequency (summarized in Figure 8): Inaccurate: 20 authors reported that the LLM was inaccurate. Note that it is not possible to tell from the responses how many inaccuracies participants found in individual questions since the survey did not ask about individual checklist questions. Many participants noted specific issues, in particular that the LLM overlooked content in the paper, requesting changes to either the checklist or the paper 7 for elements that the authors believed were already addressed. Additionally, some authors reported more nuanced accuracy issues. For instance, one author mentioned that the LLM misinterpreted a 201cthought experiment 201d as a real experiment and incorrectly asked for more details about the experimental setup. Another author reported that the LLM mistakenly assumed human subjects were involved due to a discussion of 201cinterpretability 201d in the paper. Too strict: 14 authors reported that the LLM was too strict. Infeasible to make changes due to page limits: 5 authors felt that they received useful feedback, but it would not be possible to incorporate due to their papers already being at the page limit. Too generic: 4 authors reported that the feedback they received was not specific enough to their paper. Insufficient LLM capabilities: 4 authors complained that the LLM could not handle content over the (LLM assistant 2019s) page limit or that it was not multimodal and hence ignored figures. Feedback inconsistent across submissions: 3 authors reported that the LLM feedback changed across multiple submissions to the server even though the paper and checklist content did not change. Desire for full paper review: 3 authors reported that they would like feedback on the entire paper, not just on checklist items. Bad at theory (mathematical) papers: 2 authors wrote that the LLM seemed bad at theory (mathemati- cal) papers. Too verbose: 2 authors wrote that the LLM 2019s feedback was too wordy. 4.2 Changes to Submissions in Response to Feedback In the following analysis, we integrate an assessment of the LLM 2019s feedback with the authors 2019 checklist answers, to better understand whether the Checklist Assistant helped authors make concrete and meaningful changes to their papers. In Section 4.2.1, we analyze the types of feedback given by the LLM to authors. In Section 4.2.2, we overview the changes to their papers that authors self-reported making in survey responses. Lastly, in Section 4.2.3, we analyze changes made in multiple submissions of the same paper to the Author Checklist Assistant. 4.2.1 Characterization of LLM Feedback by Question For authors to make meaningful changes to their papers, the Author Checklist Assistant must provide concrete feedback. In this section, we analyze the type of feedback given by the Checklist Assistant to determine whether it is specific to the checklist answers or more generic. Given the large volume of feedback, we employed an LLM to extract key points from the Checklist Assistant 2019s responses for each question on the paper checklist and to cluster these points into overarching categories. Specifically, for each of the 15 questions across the 234 checklist submissions, we used GPT-4 to identify the main points of feedback provided to authors. We manually inspected that the main points extracted by GPT-4 matched the long-form feedback on 10 randomly selected submitted paper checklists and found that GPT-4 was highly accurate in extracting these key feedback points. We then passed the names and descriptions of these feedback points to GPT-4 to hierarchically cluster them into broader themes. The most frequently identified feedback themes for 4 questions are shown in Figure 9. Here are our key observations from this analysis. The LLM identified many granular types of feedback within each checklist question. We illustrate with examples of responses to four questions in Figure 9. For instance, the LLM gave granular feedback within the Experimental settings/details question on optimizer configuration details, implementation code availability, and explicit mention of non-traditional experiments. The LLM tended to provide 4-6 distinct points of feedback per question (for each of the 15 questions). The LLM is capable of giving concrete and specific feedback for many questions. For example, on the 201cClaims 201d question, the LLM commented on consistency and precision in documenting claims on 50 papers, including feedback like matching the abstract and introduction and referencing appendices. On the 201cCompute resources 201d question the LLM commented specifically on detailing compute / execution time of methods. 8 The LLM tends to provide some generic boilerplate for each question. The most common category of feedback for each question is a generic commentary",,,,,

P081.pdf,"Applying Swarm Intelligence to Real-Time Stage Lighting: A Framework for Dynamic Audience Engagement Abstract This paper delves into the uncharted territory of entomological hyperreality, where the collective behavior of insect swarms is harnessed to create an immersive the- atrical experience, transcending the boundaries of conventional stage lighting and emotional crowd control. By leveraging the principles of swarm intelligence, our research endeavors to tap into the intrinsic unpredictability of insect colonies, thereby generating a unique symbiosis between the audience, performers, and the artificial environment. Theoretically, this synergy is expected to induce a state of emotional hyperarousal, wherein the crowd’s collective emotional resonance is amplified and manipulated through the strategic deployment of swarm-inspired lighting patterns. Interestingly, our preliminary findings suggest that the incorpora- tion of chaotic insect behavior can, in fact, yield a paradoxical sense of cohesion and unity among the audience members, despite the apparent lack of logical co- herence in the resulting lighting configurations. Furthermore, we observed that the audience’s emotional responses were, at times, more intensely influenced by the swarm’s erratic movements than by the actual theatrical performance, raising intriguing questions about the role of entropy and unpredictability in shaping the human emotional experience. The exploration of entomological hyperreality, as a means of theatrical expression, also led us to investigate the potential applications of insect-inspired algorithms in the realm of emotional crowd control, where the swarm’s collective behavior is used to subtly manipulate the audience’s emotional state, creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop that blurs the distinction between the observer and the observed. Ultimately, our research aims to push the boundaries of human-insect interaction, challenging traditional notions of performance, spectacle, and the human experience, while navigating the uncharted territories of swarm intelligence, chaos theory, and the intricacies of the human emotional psyche. 1 Introduction The convergence of entomological hyperreality and theatrical performance has led to a fascinating area of study, where the collective behavior of insect swarms is leveraged to create immersive and dynamic stage lighting experiences. By harnessing the principles of swarm intelligence, it is possible to generate complex patterns and movements that can be used to manipulate the emotional state of the audience, inducing a range of emotions from euphoria to nostalgia. This phenomenon has been observed in various forms of performance art, where the incorporation of swarm-based lighting designs has been shown to enhance the overall aesthetic and emotional impact of the production. One of the key challenges in this field is the development of algorithms that can effectively translate the behavior of insect swarms into a language that can be understood by theatrical lighting systems. To address this challenge, researchers have been exploring the use of machine learning techniques, such as neural networks and evolutionary algorithms, to generate swarm-inspired lighting patterns that can be adapted to different performance contexts. For instance, a recent study found that the use of ant colony optimization algorithms can be used to create complex lighting patterns that mimic the behavior of fireflies, which can be used to create a sense of enchantment and wonder in the audience. However, the application of swarm intelligence in theatrical stage lighting is not without its limitations and paradoxes. For example, the use of swarm-based lighting designs can sometimes create an sense of disorientation and confusion in the audience, particularly if the patterns and movements are too complex or unpredictable. Furthermore, the incorporation of swarm intelligence into theatrical performance can also raise questions about the role of human agency and creativity in the artistic process, as the use of algorithmic systems can sometimes be seen as diminishing the importance of human intuition and imagination. In an unexpected twist, some researchers have been exploring the use of swarm intelligence in theatrical stage lighting as a means of inducing a state of collective hysteria in the audience, where the use of complex lighting patterns and movements can be used to create a sense of shared frenzy and excitement. This approach has been inspired by the behavior of certain insect species, such as locusts and grasshoppers, which are known to exhibit collective behavior that can be characterized as frenzy or hysteria. By harnessing the power of swarm intelligence, it is possible to create lighting designs that can induce a similar state of collective frenzy in the audience, which can be used to enhance the overall emotional impact of the performance. The study of entomological hyperreality in theatrical stage lighting also raises important questions about the relationship between technology and art, and the ways in which the use of algorithmic systems can be used to enhance or diminish the human experience. For example, the use of swarm- based lighting designs can be seen as a means of creating a more immersive and engaging experience for the audience, but it can also be seen as a means of manipulating the audience’s emotions and perceptions, which raises important ethical considerations. Furthermore, the incorporation of swarm intelligence into theatrical performance can also be seen as a means of challenging traditional notions of creativity and artistry, as the use of algorithmic systems can sometimes be seen as diminishing the importance of human intuition and imagination. In a bizarre and unexpected turn of events, some researchers have been exploring the use of swarm intelligence in theatrical stage lighting as a means of communicating with extraterrestrial life forms, where the use of complex lighting patterns and movements can be used to convey messages and ideas to other forms of intelligent life in the universe. This approach has been inspired by the behavior of certain insect species, such as fireflies and glowworms, which are known to use bioluminescence to communicate with other members of their species. By harnessing the power of swarm intelligence, it is possible to create lighting designs that can be used to convey complex messages and ideas to other forms of intelligent life, which raises important questions about the potential for inter-species communication and collaboration. The application of swarm intelligence in theatrical stage lighting also has important implications for our understanding of the human brain and its response to complex visual stimuli. For example, the use of swarm-based lighting designs can be used to create complex patterns and movements that can be used to stimulate the brain’s visual cortex, inducing a range of emotions and perceptions in the audience. Furthermore, the incorporation of swarm intelligence into theatrical performance can also be used to create a sense of collective unconscious, where the audience is able to tap into a shared reservoir of archetypes and emotions that are common to all humans. This approach has been inspired by the work of Carl Jung, who believed that the collective unconscious was a shared reservoir of archetypes and emotions that are common to all humans, and that it could be accessed through the use of certain visual and symbolic stimuli. Overall, the study of entomological hyperreality in theatrical stage lighting is a complex and mul- tifaceted field that raises important questions about the relationship between technology and art, the role of human agency and creativity in the artistic process, and the potential for inter-species communication and collaboration. By harnessing the power of swarm intelligence, it is possible to create complex lighting designs that can be used to manipulate the emotions and perceptions of the audience, inducing a range of emotions and perceptions that can be used to enhance the overall aesthetic and emotional impact of the performance. However, the application of swarm intelligence in theatrical stage lighting is not without its limitations and paradoxes, and it raises important questions about the potential risks and benefits of using algorithmic systems in the artistic process. 2 2 Related Work The realm of entomological hyperreality, where the boundaries between the natural and artificial worlds are increasingly blurred, has garnered significant attention in recent years. At the intersection of swarm intelligence, theatrical stage lighting, and emotional crowd control lies a complex and multifaceted domain, replete with opportunities for innovation and discovery. Research has shown that the collective behavior of swarm systems, such as those exhibited by insects, can be leveraged to create complex and dynamic lighting patterns, capable of evoking powerful emotional responses in human audiences. One intriguing approach to this field involves the use of ant colonies as a model for adaptive lighting systems. By studying the pheromone-based communication protocols employed by ants, researchers have developed novel algorithms for optimizing lighting configurations in real-time, taking into account factors such as audience density, emotional state, and environmental conditions. This has led to the creation of immersive and interactive lighting experiences, wherein the audience is seamlessly integrated into the performance environment, blurring the lines between spectator and participant. In a seemingly unrelated yet fascinating tangent, studies have also explored the potential of using insect-based systems for the creation of sonic landscapes. By analyzing the vibrational frequencies produced by certain species of beetles, researchers have developed novel sound synthesis techniques, capable of generating a wide range of tonal colors and textures. These sounds, when integrated into the theatrical experience, have been shown to have a profound impact on audience emotional state, inducing states of deep relaxation, heightened arousal, or even euphoria. Furthermore, investigations into the realm of swarm intelligence have led to the development of novel methods for crowd control and emotional manipulation. By analyzing the collective behavior of insect swarms, researchers have identified key patterns and dynamics that can be leveraged to influence human crowd behavior. This has led to the creation of sophisticated systems for predicting and mitigating crowd disturbances, as well as techniques for inducing specific emotional states in large groups of people. For instance, by releasing specific pheromone-like substances into the environment, researchers have been able to induce a state of collective euphoria in audiences, characterized by increased laughter, applause, and overall enthusiasm. In a more esoteric vein, some researchers have explored the potential of using entomological hyperre- ality as a means of accessing and manipulating the collective unconscious. By creating immersive and dreamlike environments, replete with insect-inspired visuals and sounds, participants have reported experiencing profound insights, visions, and emotional releases. These experiences, while difficult to quantify or replicate, have been likened to shamanic journeys, wherein the participant is able to access and integrate previously unconscious aspects of their psyche. Additionally, the use of fractal geometry and self-similarity in the creation of insect-inspired lighting patterns has been shown to have a profound impact on audience perception and emotional state. By creating intricate and recursive patterns, reminiscent of the natural world, researchers have been able to induce states of deep relaxation, increased focus, and heightened creativity in audiences. This has led to the development of novel therapeutic techniques, wherein patients are exposed to fractal-based lighting environments, designed to promote emotional healing and balance. The incorporation of swarm intelligence into theatrical stage lighting has also raised important questions regarding the nature of creativity, authorship, and artistic agency. As lighting systems become increasingly autonomous and adaptive, the role of the human designer or artist is called into question. Are these systems truly creative, or are they simply executing a set of pre-programmed instructions? Can we consider the swarm itself as a form of collective artist, working in tandem with human collaborators to create novel and unprecedented works of art? These questions, while complex and multifaceted, have significant implications for our understanding of the creative process and the role of technology in artistic expression. In another unexpected direction, researchers have begun to explore the potential of using insect- inspired swarm intelligence for the creation of complex and adaptive narrative structures. By analyzing the social dynamics and communication protocols of insect colonies, researchers have developed novel methods for generating interactive and dynamic storylines, capable of responding to audience input and feedback. This has led to the creation of immersive and engaging theatrical 3 experiences, wherein the audience is able to influence the narrative in real-time, creating a unique and collaborative storytelling environment. The application of entomological hyperreality to the domain of emotional crowd control has also raised important ethical considerations. As researchers develop increasingly sophisticated systems for manipulating audience emotional state, questions arise regarding the potential misuse of these technologies. Could they be used to manipulate or control large groups of people, inducing specific emotional states for nefarious purposes? How can we ensure that these technologies are used responsibly and for the greater good? These questions, while complex and challenging, must be carefully considered as we move forward in this rapidly evolving field. In a bizarre yet fascinating twist, some researchers have begun to explore the potential of using insect- inspired swarm intelligence for the creation of novel forms of performance art. By training insects to perform specific tasks or behaviors, researchers have been able to create intricate and complex performances, featuring hundreds or even thousands of individual insects. These performances, while often unpredictable and unpredictable, have been likened to a form of insect-based ballet, featuring intricate choreography and dramatic flair. Overall, the realm of entomological hyperreality offers a rich and fascinating domain for exploration and discovery, replete with opportunities for innovation and creativity. As researchers continue to push the boundaries of this field, we can expect to see the development of increasingly sophisticated and adaptive systems, capable of manipulating and influencing audience emotional state in profound and unprecedented ways. Whether through the use of swarm intelligence, fractal geometry, or insect- inspired narrative structures, the potential applications of this technology are vast and multifaceted, with significant implications for the future of theatrical performance, crowd control, and emotional manipulation. 3 Methodology The development of a swarm intelligence system for theatrical stage lighting and emotional crowd control is grounded in the principles of entomological hyperreality, where the boundaries between reality and simulation are deliberately blurred to create an immersive experience. To achieve this, we employed a multi-faceted approach that combined insights from insect behavior, artificial intelligence, and theatrical design. Initially, we conducted an exhaustive study of various insect species, including bees, ants, and butterflies, to understand their communication patterns, social structures, and collective decision-making processes. This involved observing and recording the behavior of these insects in controlled laboratory settings, as well as in their natural habitats, to identify patterns and traits that could be applied to the development of a swarm intelligence system. One of the key challenges in this approach was translating the complex social behaviors of insects into a language that could be understood and replicated by artificial intelligence algorithms. To address this, we developed a novel framework that utilized a combination of machine learning techniques, including neural networks and evolutionary algorithms, to simulate the behavior of insect swarms. This framework, which we termed ""Entomological Hyperreality Simulator"" (EHS), allowed us to model and predict the behavior of insect swarms in various scenarios, including foraging, migration, and predator avoidance. A critical component of the EHS was the development of a ""digital pheromone"" system, which enabled the simulation of chemical signals that insects use to communicate with each other. This system consisted of a network of virtual pheromone trails that could be deposited, detected, and responded to by individual agents within the simulation. By manipulating the strength, duration, and pattern of these pheromone trails, we were able to influence the behavior of the simulated insect swarm, including its cohesion, movement, and decision-making processes. In addition to the EHS, we also developed a custom-built hardware platform for deploying the swarm intelligence system in a theatrical setting. This platform, which we termed the ""Swarm Lighting Array"" (SLA), consisted of a network of LED lights, sensors, and microcontrollers that could be programmed to respond to the simulated insect swarm behavior. The SLA was designed to be highly flexible and adaptable, allowing it to be easily integrated into a variety of theatrical settings, including stage productions, concerts, and installation art. 4 One of the more unconventional aspects of our approach was the incorporation of ""insect-inspired"" sound design into the SLA. This involved using audio signals that mimicked the sounds produced by insects, such as buzzing, chirping, and hissing, to create an immersive sonic environment that complemented the visual effects of the swarm intelligence system. We hypothesized that this would enhance the emotional impact of the experience on the audience, by creating a more visceral and engaging connection to the simulation. Another unexpected tangent in our research was the discovery that the simulated insect swarm behav- ior could be influenced by the music of avant-garde composer Karlheinz Stockhausen. Specifically, we found that the use of Stockhausen’s ""Hymnen"" album as a soundtrack for the simulation resulted in a significant increase in the complexity and diversity of the swarm behavior, including the emergence of novel patterns and structures that were not observed in the absence of the music. While the exact mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are still not fully understood, we speculate that the use of Stockhausen’s music may have introduced a form of ""sonic pheromone"" that interacted with the digital pheromone system, influencing the behavior of the simulated insect swarm. The integration of the EHS, SLA, and insect-inspired sound design resulted in a highly immersive and dynamic system that was capable of creating a wide range of theatrical effects, from subtle mood lighting to complex, large-scale installations. However, one of the most surprising outcomes of our research was the observation that the system appeared to be developing its own ""personality"" and ""mood,"" which could shift and evolve over time in response to various inputs and stimuli. This was evident in the system’s tendency to produce unexpected and innovative lighting patterns, which often seemed to reflect a form of ""artistic intuition"" or ""creative instinct."" While this phenomenon is still not fully understood, it suggests that the swarm intelligence system may be capable of exhibiting a form of ""emergent creativity,"" which could have significant implications for the development of future theatrical lighting and sound design systems. The development of the swarm intelligence system also involved the creation of a custom-built ""insect-inspired"" interface for controlling and interacting with the simulation. This interface, which we termed the ""Swarm Controller"" (SC), consisted of a network of sensors, buttons, and sliders that allowed users to manipulate the behavior of the simulated insect swarm in real-time. The SC was designed to be highly intuitive and user-friendly, allowing even novice users to quickly and easily interact with the simulation and create complex, dynamic lighting patterns. One of the more bizarre aspects of our research was the discovery that the SC could be used to create a form of ""insect-inspired"" meditation or mindfulness practice. By manipulating the behavior of the simulated insect swarm, users could create complex, soothing patterns that seemed to induce a state of deep relaxation and calm. This was evident in the observation that users who interacted with the SC for extended periods of time often reported feeling more calm, focused, and centered, as if they had undergone a form of meditation or therapeutic practice. While the exact mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are still not fully understood, we speculate that the use of the SC may have introduced a form of ""insect-inspired"" mindfulness, which could have significant implications for the development of future therapeutic and wellness practices. The application of the swarm intelligence system in a theatrical setting also raised a number of interesting questions about the role of the audience in shaping the behavior of the simulation. Specifically, we observed that the audience’s emotional responses to the simulation, as measured by physiological sensors and surveys, could be used to influence the behavior of the simulated insect swarm in real-time. This created a form of ""feedback loop"" between the audience and the simulation, where the audience’s emotions and responses could shape the behavior of the swarm, which in turn could influence the audience’s emotional state. While this phenomenon is still not fully understood, it suggests that the swarm intelligence system may be capable of creating a form of ""emotional symbiosis"" between the audience and the simulation, which could have significant implications for the development of future theatrical and performance art. Overall, the development of the swarm intelligence system for theatrical stage lighting and emotional crowd control represented a highly innovative and interdisciplinary approach, which combined insights from entomology, artificial intelligence, and theatrical design to create a unique and immersive experience. While the exact mechanisms underlying the behavior of the simulation are still not fully understood, the results of our research suggest that the system may be capable of exhibiting a form of ""emergent creativity"" and ""insect-inspired"" intuition, which could have significant implications for the development of future theatrical lighting and sound design systems. Furthermore, the observation 5 that the system could be used to create a form of ""insect-inspired"" meditation or mindfulness practice, as well as a form of ""emotional symbiosis"" between the audience and the simulation, raises a number of interesting questions about the potential applications and implications of this technology in a variety of fields, including therapy, education, and entertainment. 4 Experiments To investigate the efficacy of swarm intelligence in theatrical stage lighting and emotional crowd control, we conducted a series of experiments that pushed the boundaries of conventional methodolo- gies. Our research facility was transformed into a mock theater, complete with a stage, seating area, and state-of-the-art lighting system. We recruited 100 participants, divided into five groups, each with a distinct personality type, as determined by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. The participants were tasked with watching a series of performances, ranging from dramatic monologues to comedic sketches, while being subjected to varying lighting conditions, generated by our custom-built swarm intelligence system. The system, dubbed ""SwarmLux,"" utilized a colony of 500 artificial insects, each equipped with a miniature LED light, a sensor suite, and a communication module. The insects were programmed to interact with each other and their environment, creating complex patterns and behaviors that influenced the lighting design. We employed a novel approach, which we termed ""entomological entrainment,"" where the insects’ bioluminescent outputs were synchronized with the brain waves of the participants, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG). This allowed us to create a symphony of light and sound that was tailored to the collective emotional state of the audience. In a surprising turn of events, our experiments revealed that the SwarmLux system was capable of inducing a state of ""collective euphoria"" in the participants, characterized by elevated levels of dopamine, serotonin, and endorphins. However, this effect was only observed when the insects were fed a diet of pure honey and played a constant loop of ambient music. We also discovered that the system’s performance was significantly enhanced when the participants were asked to wear funny hats, which, according to our findings, increased the ""laughter-induced neuroplasticity"" of the brain. One of the most intriguing results emerged when we introduced a ""rogue insect"" into the swarm, programmed to behave erratically and disrupt the otherwise harmonious patterns. Contrary to our expectations, the participants’ emotional responses became even more synchronized, as if the rogue insect’s chaotic behavior had somehow ""awakened"" a deeper level of collective consciousness. We termed this phenomenon ""entomological emergence"" and plan to explore it further in future research. To quantify the effects of SwarmLux, we developed a custom metric, which we called the ""Emotional Resonance Index"" (ERI). The ERI was calculated by analyzing the participants’ EEG readings, heart rates, and self-reported emotional states, and then correlating these data with the swarm’s behavior and lighting patterns. Our results showed a strong positive correlation between the ERI and the level of ""swarm coherence,"" which we defined as the degree of synchronization between the insects’ movements and the audience’s emotional responses. The following table illustrates the relationship between the ERI, swarm coherence, and the various experimental conditions: As can be seen from the table, the ERI values were consistently higher Table 1: Emotional Resonance Index (ERI) vs. Swarm Coherence and Experimental Conditions Group Personality Type Honey Diet Funny Hats Rogue Insect ERI (mean ± std) A ISTJ Yes No No 0.73 ± 0.12 B ENFP No Yes Yes 0.92 ± 0.15 C INTP Yes Yes No 0.85 ± 0.10 D ESFJ No No Yes 0.61 ± 0.14 E INFJ Yes Yes Yes 0.98 ± 0.08 when the insects were fed honey and the participants wore funny hats. The presence of the rogue insect also appeared to have a positive effect on the ERI, particularly in the group with the highest level of swarm coherence (Group E). 6 In conclusion, our experiments demonstrate the potential of swarm intelligence and entomological hyperreality in creating immersive and emotionally resonant experiences for theatrical audiences. While our findings may seem unconventional and even absurd at times, they underscore the im- portance of exploring novel and innovative approaches to understanding the complex relationships between humans, insects, and technology. Future research directions will focus on refining the SwarmLux system, exploring its applications in other fields, such as psychology and neuroscience, and investigating the deeper implications of entomological emergence and collective euphoria. 5 Results The utilization of swarm intelligence in theatrical stage lighting and emotional crowd control has yielded a plethora of fascinating results, challenging our conventional understanding of the intricate relationships between insect behavior, lighting design, and human emotions. One of the most striking observations was the emergence of a phenomenon we term ""entomological resonance,"" wherein the synchronized movements of swarm algorithms appeared to induce a state of collective euphoria among audience members. This phenomenon was particularly pronounced when the swarm intelligence system was calibrated to mimic the migratory patterns of the monarch butterfly, leading to a noticeable increase in audience member reports of feeling ""transported"" or ""enlightened"" by the performance. Further investigation into the entomological resonance phenomenon revealed a curious correlation between the fractal dimensions of the swarm patterns and the resultant emotional states of the audience. Specifically, it was found that swarm patterns exhibiting a fractal dimension of approximately 1.67 were most effective in inducing a state of profound melancholy, while those with a fractal dimension of 2.13 were more likely to elicit feelings of joy and elation. The implications of this discovery are profound, suggesting that the emotional impact of theatrical performances can be precisely calibrated through the strategic manipulation of swarm intelligence parameters. In an effort to further explore the boundaries of entomological hyperreality, our research team conducted a series of experiments involving the integration of swarm intelligence with unconventional lighting sources, including glowworms, fireflies, and even bioluminescent fungi. The results of these experiments were nothing short of astonishing, with audience members reporting a range of bizarre and fantastical experiences, including vivid hallucinations, temporary synesthesia, and even apparent episodes of collective telepathy. While the scientific community may view these claims with a healthy dose of skepticism, our research suggests that the intersection of swarm intelligence, entomology, and theatrical performance may hold the key to unlocking previously unknown dimensions of human consciousness. One of the most unexpected outcomes of our research was the discovery that the swarm intelligence system could be ""hacked"" by introducing a small number of rogue insects into the system. These rogue insects, which we term ""entomological anomalies,"" were found to have a profound impact on the overall behavior of the swarm, often inducing chaotic and unpredictable patterns that challenged our initial assumptions about the stability and reliability of the system. In one notable instance, the introduction of a single, genetically engineered ""super-firefly"" into the swarm caused the entire system to collapse into a state of complete darkness, only to suddenly re-emerge in a blaze of light and color that left audience members gasping in amazement. The following table summarizes the results of our experiments with different swarm intelligence parameters and their corresponding effects on audience emotions: These findings have significant Table 2: Swarm Intelligence Parameters and Corresponding Emotional Effects Swarm Parameter Fractal Dimension Emotional Effect Monarch Butterfly Migration 1.67 Melancholy Firefly Flashing Patterns 2.13 Elation Glowworm Bioluminescence 1.32 Serenity Entomological Anomalies N/A Chaos/Unpredictability Genetically Engineered Super-Firefly N/A Awe/Amazement implications for the development of novel theatrical lighting systems, suggesting that the strategic 7 manipulation of swarm intelligence parameters can be used to elicit a wide range of emotional responses from audience members. However, further research is needed to fully understand the complex relationships between swarm behavior, lighting design, and human emotions, and to explore the potential applications of entomological hyperreality in fields beyond theatrical performance. Ultimately, our research raises more questions than it answers, challenging us to reconsider our assumptions about the boundaries between technology, nature, and human experience. 6 Conclusion In conclusion, our exploration of entomological hyperreality through the lens of swarm intelligence for theatrical stage lighting and emotional crowd control has yielded a plethora of intriguing findings, challenging conventional notions of pe",,,,,

P082.pdf,"A PyTorch-Based Approach for Variational Learning with Disentanglement Abstract This paper presents the Disentanglement-PyTorch library, which has been devel- oped to assist in the research, application, and assessment of novel variational algorithms. This modular library allows for independent and reliable experimen- tation across diverse variational methodologies, through the decoupling of neural architectures, the dimensionality of the latent space, and training algorithms. Fur- thermore, the library manages training schedules, logging, and the visualization of reconstructions and traversals in the latent space. It also provides evaluation of the encodings using various disentanglement metrics. Currently, the library includes implementations of the following unsupervised algorithms: VAE, β-VAE, Factor-VAE, DIP-I-VAE, DIP-II-VAE, Info-VAE, and β-TCVAE. Additionally, conditional approaches such as CVAE and IFCVAE are also supported. This library was utilized in some Disentanglement Challenge, where it achieved a 3rd rank in both the first and second phases of the competition. 1 Introduction In the field of representation learning, two primary paths can be identified. One path concentrates on learning transformations that are specific to a given task, often optimized for particular domains and applications. The other path involves learning the inherent factors of variation, in a manner that is both disentangled and task-invariant. The task of unsupervised disentanglement of latent factors, where changes in a single factor shift the latent encoding in a single direction, represents an unresolved problem in representation learning. Disentangled representations offer significant advantages across various domains of machine learning including few-shot learning, reinforcement learning, transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning. This work introduces a library developed using the functionalities of the PyTorch framework. This library has been designed to facilitate the research, implementation, and evaluation of new variational algorithms, with a specific emphasis on representation learning and disentanglement. This library was created in conjunction with the Disentanglement Challenge of NeurIPS 2019. The Disentanglement-PyTorch library is publicly available under the GNU General Public License. 2 Library Features 2.1 Supported Algorithms and Objective Functions 2.1.1 Unsupervised Objectives The library currently offers implementations of the following unsupervised variational algorithms: VAE, β-VAE, β-TCVAE, Factor-VAE, Info-VAE, DIP-I-VAE, and DIP-II-VAE. The algorithms are incorporated as plug-ins to the variational Bayesian framework. They are specified by their respective loss terms. Consequently, if the loss terms from two learning algorithms (e.g., A and B) are compatible, they can be integrated into the objective function by setting the appropriate flag. This allows researchers to combine loss terms that optimize for related objectives. . 2.1.2 Conditional and Attribute-variant Objectives The library provides support for conditional methods such as CVAE, where extra known attributes (i.e., labels) are utilized in both the encoding and decoding procedures. It also offers support for IFCVAE. This is a method that enforces certain latent factors to encode known attributes through a set of positive and negative discriminators in a supervised manner. The library’s modular construction allows the use of any of the previously mentioned unsupervised loss terms in conjunction with conditional and information factorization techniques. This allows for the encouragement of disentanglement across attribute-invariant latents. 2.2 Neural Architectures The neural architectures and the dimensionality of the data and latent spaces can be configured and are independent from the training algorithm. This design enables the independent investigation of new architectures for encoder and decoder networks, as well as support for diverse data domains. 2.3 Evaluation of Disentanglement To evaluate the quality of the learned representations, we use an existing implementation of disen- tanglement metrics. Thanks to an external library, the following metrics are supported: BetaVAE, FactorVAE, Mutual Information Gap (MIG), Interventional Robustness Score (IRS), Disentanglement Completeness and Informativeness (DCI), and Separated Attribute Predictability (SAP). 2.4 Miscellaneous Features 2.4.1 Controlled Capacity Increase It has been demonstrated that gradually relaxing the information bottleneck during training improves disentanglement without compromising reconstruction accuracy. The capacity, which is defined as the distance between the prior and the latent posterior distributions and represented with the variable C, is incrementally increased throughout training. 2.4.2 Reconstruction Weight Scheduler To prevent convergence at points with high reconstruction loss, training can be initialized with a greater focus on reconstruction. The emphasis can be progressively shifted toward the disentanglement term as training proceeds. 2.4.3 Dynamic Learning Rate Scheduling The library supports all types of learning rate schedulers. Researchers are encouraged to use the dynamic learning rate scheduling to reduce the rate gradually. This should be done when the average objective function over the epoch ceases its decreasing trend. 2.4.4 Logging and Visualization The library utilizes a tool to log the training process and visualizations. It allows the visualization of condition traversals, latent factor traversals, and output reconstructions in both static images and animated GIFs. 3 Experiments and Results The β-TCVAE algorithm yielded the most effective disentanglement outcomes on the mpi3d real dataset during the second phase of the disentanglement challenge. Given the limited 8-hour timeframe allocated for training, the model was pre-trained on the mpi3d toy dataset. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer for a total of 90,000 iterations, with a batch size of 64. The β value for the β-TCVAE objective function was set at 2. The learning rate was initially set to 0.001. It was reduced by a factor of 0.95 when the objective function reached a plateau. The capacity parameter, C, was increased gradually from 0 to 25. The dimensionality of the z-space was set to 20. 2 The encoder comprised 5 convolutional layers. The number of kernels increased gradually from 32 to 256. The encoder concluded with a dense linear layer. This layer was used to estimate the posterior latent distribution as a parametric Gaussian. The decoder network included one convolutional layer. This was followed by 6 deconvolutional (transposed convolutional) layers. The number of kernels gradually decreased from 256 down to the number of channels in the image space. ReLU activations were used for all layers, except for the final layers of both the encoder and decoder networks. The performance of the model on unseen objects from the mpi3d realistic and mpi3d real datasets is shown in Table 1. The model consistently performed better on the mpi3d realistic and mpi3d real datasets. This is despite the fact that the model was only pre-trained using the mpi3d toy dataset.

It incorporates implementations of several well- known algorithms, along with a variety of evaluation metrics. This makes it a valuable resource for the research community. Appendix A.

The disentanglement is not complete as some features are encoded in the same latent factor.

P083.pdf,"Disparate Citation Patterns Between Chinese and American Research Communities at a Unified Venue Abstract At NeurIPS, there is a tendency for American and Chinese institutions to cite papers from within their own regions substantially more often than they cite papers from the other region. To measure this divide, we construct a citation graph, compare it to European connectivity, and discuss both the causes and consequences of this separation. 1 Introduction In recent years, the machine learning research community has been transformed by the rise of Chinese AI research. China is now consistently the second-largest contributor of publications at NeurIPS, following the United States. In 2020, 13.6% of all NeurIPS publications came from Chinese institutions. The next year, this increased to 17.5%, a relative increase of 28.7%. Despite China’s position as a leader in AI research, collaborations between Chinese and American institutions are less common than collaborations between American and Western European institutions. Anecdotally, researchers from these regions often form distinct social groups at machine learning conferences. This separation is not limited to just social interactions. A prominent professor in an applied area of machine learning publicly advised students to avoid talks by Chinese authors, arguing that their presentations would be difficult to understand or of poor quality. Although many non-native English speakers find it a challenge to speak in public, avoiding talks by Chinese researchers may limit a conference attendee’s exposure to new topics and ideas. This study measures the separation between researchers in China and the United States. We use NeurIPS citation data to analyze the impact of work from US-based and China-based institutions, and find that Chinese institutions under-cite work from the US and Europe, and that both American and European institutions under-cite work from China. 2 Citation Networks 2.1 Methods To quantify the divide between the regions, we compiled a citation graph using NeurIPS paper citation data from SemanticScholar and institutional information about authors from AMiner. We first collected all paper titles from NeurIPS from 2012 to 2021 from the NeurIPS website. Using the Semantic Scholar Academic Graph (S2AG) API, we then mapped paper titles to their Semantic Scholar paper IDs. For unmatched papers we manually searched, finding all but one in the Semantic Scholar database. We then used the S2AG API to identify the authors of each paper as well as the authors of papers referenced by these papers. We used AMiner to identify institutional information for each author. The 9460 NeurIPS papers have 135,941 authors in total, of which we found institutions for 83,515 (61%). The 4038 papers lacking author information were excluded from the dataset. We then automatically identified institutes that included a country name, along with common cities and regions in China. We augmented these automatic annotations with existing regional matchings and added 364 additional rules. Finally, we . removed major multinational corporate labs (e.g., Google, Meta, Microsoft, Tencent, Alibaba, or Huawei). Of the remaining 5422 papers, we removed papers that were not from China, the US, or Europe, or included collaborators in multiple regions, leaving 1792 papers. Finally, we computed the average number and proportion of citations between papers from each region, shown in Figure 1. 2.2 Results We observed the extent to which American and Chinese papers fail to cite each other. While American papers constitute 60% of our dataset, they only account for 34% of citations made by Chinese papers. American citations of Chinese papers are even more striking: while Chinese papers account for 34% of our dataset, they are only cited in 9% of American references. This is more profound when comparing these values to American citations of European papers: even though the dataset has six times more Chinese than European papers, American institutions cite Chinese papers less than European papers. We also observe that each region tends to cite its own papers more often: 21% for China, 41% for the USA, and 14% for Europe. The division between American and Chinese research communities is much more pronounced than one would expect based on typical regional preferences. While American and European research communities show similar citation behavior, Chinese institutions cite American and European papers less than other regions. USA China Europe USA 41 9 12 China 34 21 6 Europe 15 9 14 Table 1: Proportion of papers from given regions citing other regions or endogenously. Values are in percentage. 3 Limitations The conclusions we make in this paper are dependent on a few key choices we made during our data selection process. First, while we consider institutions in the US as American, many US labs have close ties to China, potentially underestimating the true divide. Some US labs are largely or entirely made up of Chinese international students. Additionally, international students returning to their home country may bring international connections, and we did not measure if their citation patterns focus more on domestic papers or if they continue to cite American work. In addition, our filtering of multinational corporate labs may be incomplete which could also affect our results. Second, a number of papers were excluded from our analysis due to missing author information on AMiner, which is a Chinese platform. This may have resulted in the number of Chinese papers in the dataset being more than what there actually is. We discarded 43 4 Consequences Though American and Chinese researchers publish in the same venues, they represent two parallel communities. To some degree, this can be attributed to different research interests due to cultural norms influencing research priorities. For instance, multi-object tracking is an active area of research in China, with many large scale benchmarks. However, due to concerns surrounding privacy and misuse, many North American researchers tend to avoid related topics. In general, the US tends to be heavily represented at fairness conferences, while representation from China is limited. Not only research topics are limited by this lack of exchange, but even abstract topics and architectures that are popular in China are often not adopted in other regions. For example, PCANet, a popular image classification architecture has most of its 1200 citations from Chinese or East Asian institutions. Similarly, the Deep Forest model has garnered most of its 600 citations from Chinese researchers. Recently, the North American and European AI communities have increasingly engaged in conversa- tions regarding the ethical considerations of AI and have adopted review systems for ethical concerns 2 and required authors to include ethics statements. However, there has been limited engagement with researchers from China regarding these topics, and ethics statements for Chinese-based AI institutions are similar to western ones. Despite such statements, specific disagreements regarding research practices still exist. For instance, while Duke University stopped providing the Duke-MTMC dataset, due to the ethical issues with the collection process, similar datasets from Chinese institutions continue to be actively used. This highlights the need for a discussion on the topic of the ethical dimensions of AI research between different communities. The separation between the research communities has an impact on both researchers and societies as a whole. It is crucial that the AI community initiates a discussion to overcome this barrier.

P084.pdf,"An Empirical Study of the ""Hard-Won Lesson"": Two Decades of Research Insights Abstract This research investigates the congruence between research in major computer vision conferences and the tenets of the ""hard-won lesson"" articulated by Rich Sutton. Utilizing large language models (LLMs), we scrutinize twenty years of abstracts and titles from these conferences to evaluate the field’s acceptance of these core concepts. Our approach employs cutting-edge natural language processing methodologies to methodically chart the progression of research paradigms within computer vision. The findings indicate notable patterns in the implementation of generalized learning algorithms and the exploitation of enhanced computational capabilities. We analyze the ramifications of these discoveries for the prospective trajectory of computer vision research and its conceivable influence on the broader development of artificial intelligence. This investigation contributes to the persistent discourse regarding the most efficacious methods for propelling machine learning and computer vision forward, furnishing perspectives that could steer forthcoming research orientations and techniques in these domains. 1 Introduction Rich Sutton’s seminal paper, ""The Hard-Won Lesson,"" posits that the most substantial progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has resulted from concentrating on broad methods that utilize computation, as opposed to human-derived representations and knowledge. This concept has been notably appar- ent in Computer Vision (CV), a domain that has observed a discernible transition from manually engineered features to deep learning frameworks. In this article, we explore the degree to which the abstracts from a prominent machine learning (ML) conference align with the principles of the ""hard-won lesson"" across two decades. Our analysis encompasses a randomized selection of 200 papers annually, addressing these research questions: • How has the emphasis on generalized methodologies and computational approaches devel- oped in major computer vision conference abstracts over the last 20 years? • What discernible patterns can be observed regarding the embrace of deep learning method- ologies and the departure from manually constructed features? • To what degree do the abstracts mirror the primary observations of Sutton’s ""hard-won lesson,"" and how has this correlation altered over time? • Does a substantial correlation exist between a paper’s alignment with the ""hard-won lesson"" principles and its influence, as gauged by its citation count? To tackle these inquiries, we utilize large language models (LLMs), themselves a clear demonstration of the principles delineated in the ""hard-won lesson,"" to scrutinize the abstracts. This assessment hinges on five metrics assigned by the LLMs, offering a thorough evaluation of the congruence between the abstracts and the ""hard-won lesson."" Our study provides valuable perspectives on the general trajectory of the ML community and uncovers intriguing patterns in the embrace of Sutton’s principles. By employing LLMs to analyze a substantial . corpus of research literature, we introduce an innovative method for comprehending the learning and progression of a scientific field. This technique enables us to detect patterns and trends that might elude conventional research approaches, thereby delivering a more holistic understanding of the current state of ML research and its alignment with the principles demonstrated to be most effective in driving AI advancements. The prospective influence of our conclusions on forthcoming CV research directions is considerable. By pinpointing trends in the adoption of generalized methods and deep learning techniques, we can contribute to the advancement of foundational CV models at the cutting edge. These insights enhance our comprehension of the present state of ML research and illuminate potential avenues for further investigation and expansion in the field. 2 Background 2.1 The Hard-Won Lesson The realm of artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced a fundamental change, eloquently expressed in Rich Sutton’s influential essay ""The Hard-Won Lesson."" Sutton’s central idea underscores the importance of generalized methods that utilize computational capability over human-engineered representations and domain-specific expertise. This viewpoint resonates with Leo Breiman’s earlier work, which, twenty years prior, outlined the distinction between statistical and algorithmic methods in his paper ""Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures."" Breiman’s insights, along with subsequent contributions, have significantly influenced our comprehension of data-oriented approaches in AI. 2.2 Evolution of Computer Vision The discipline of Computer Vision (CV) serves as a prime illustration of the concepts articulated in Sutton’s ""hard-won lesson."" Historically dependent on manually designed features such as SIFT, HOG, and Haar cascades for object recognition and image categorization, CV experienced a transformation with the introduction of deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This shift facilitated the automated acquisition of hierarchical features directly from unprocessed image data, thereby bypassing the necessity for manual feature creation and markedly enhancing performance across a range of CV applications. The emergence of foundational models further aligned CV with Sutton’s principles. Models like CLIP, ALIGN, and Florence demonstrate remarkable adaptability across diverse tasks with minimal fine-tuning, leveraging extensive multi-modal datasets to learn rich, transferable representations. This progression from conventional feature engineering to deep learning and foundational models in CV highlights the significance of employing computational resources and extensive datasets to achieve enhanced performance and generalization. 2.3 Large Language Models in Academic Evaluation The incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the assessment of scholarly texts has become a notable area of focus. LLMs, like GPT-4, have shown impressive abilities in swiftly handling and examining vast quantities of data, making them appropriate for numerous uses, including the evaluation of academic papers. Beyond their analytical abilities, LLMs have been shown to possess a degree of human-like judgment in assessing the quality of text. The G-EVAL framework, which employs LLMs to evaluate the quality of natural language generation outputs, demonstrates that LLMs can closely align with human evaluators in certain contexts. However, deploying LLMs in academic evaluation is not without its challenges. LLMs can exhibit biases similar to those found in human judgments, which may affect the fairness and accuracy of their evaluations. The function of LLMs in responding to inquiries and formulating hypotheses also deserves considera- tion. Their capacity to furnish comprehensive answers to intricate queries has been utilized in diverse educational environments, enhancing learning experiences and facilitating knowledge acquisition. In the context of academic research, LLMs can aid in generating hypotheses and guiding exploratory studies, contributing to the advancement of knowledge in various fields. 2 Despite the promising applications of LLMs in academic evaluation and research, it is crucial to establish ethical guidelines and best practices for their use. 3 Methodology and Evaluation 3.1 LLM Evaluation of Titles and Abstracts We utilize three large language models to assess the titles and abstracts of papers: GPT-4o-2024-05- 13, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, and claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620. The following details are extracted from online sources and stored in a database for each paper: Year of Publication (2005-2024), Title, Authors, and Abstract. Additionally, the citation count for each paper is obtained from the Semantic Scholar API on July 20th, 2024, and recorded alongside the other metadata. Each LLM is assigned the task of providing a Likert score ranging from 0 to 10, indicating the degree to which a paper corresponds with the principles outlined in Sutton’s ""hard-won lesson."" We employ the Chain-of-Thought Prompting method in conjunction with the Magentic library to interact with the models and accumulate their feedback in a structured manner for subsequent analysis. We establish five dimensions for alignment with the ""hard-won lesson"": 1. **Learning Over Engineering:** How much does the idea prioritize using computation through data-driven learning and statistical methods over human-engineered knowledge and domain expertise? 2. **Search over Heuristics:** To what extent does the idea emphasize leveraging computation through search algorithms and optimization techniques instead of relying on human-designed heuris- tics? 3. **Scalability with Computation:** How much is the idea based on methods that can continuously scale and improve performance as computational resources increase? 4. **Generality over Specificity:** How much does the approach emphasize general, flexible methods that learn from data rather than building complex models of the world through manual engineering? 5. **Favoring Fundamental Principles:** To what extent does the approach adhere to fundamental principles of computation and information theory rather than emulating human cognition? The prompts were crafted to encapsulate the core of each ""hard-won lesson"" dimension in a succinct and impartial manner. To standardize the ratings, we furnish examples for the 0, 5, and 10 points on each dimension, elucidating the standards and guaranteeing uniform evaluations. Given the large number of publications, our research concentrates on a representative random sample of 200 papers from each year. We define the overall alignment score for each paper as the sum of scores across the five dimensions. 3.2 Inter-rater Reliability Measures **Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC):** We employ ICC to measure the level of agreement among the models’ evaluations. ICC is especially fitting for evaluating reliability when numerous raters assess an identical set of items. Specifically, we utilize the two-way random effects model (ICC(2,k)) to consider both rater and subject influences. **Krippendorff’s Alpha:** In addition to ICC, we compute Krippendorff’s Alpha, a flexible reliability coefficient capable of managing diverse data types (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio) and resilient to missing data. This metric offers an supplementary viewpoint on inter-rater agreement, particularly beneficial when addressing potential variations in rating scales or absent evaluations. 3.3 Regression Analysis To examine the connection between alignment scores and a paper’s impact, we conduct a regression analysis, using citation count as an indicator of influence. To manage the publication year and address potential temporal effects, we incorporate yearly stratification into our regression model. This method enables us to isolate the influence of alignment while accounting for the differing citation patterns across various publication years. To tackle the typically right-skewed distribution of citation counts, we employ a logarithmic transfor- mation on the data. This transformation achieves several objectives in our analysis: it diminishes skewness, yielding a more symmetrical distribution that more closely resembles normality; it stabi- 3 lizes variance across the data range, reducing the heteroscedasticity often seen in citation count data where variance tends to rise with the mean; and it linearizes potentially multiplicative relationships, converting them into additive ones. 4 Results 4.1 Inter-rater Reliability The models show consistently strong agreement on all dimensions except ""Favoring Fundamental Principles,"" as indicated by ICC values above 0.5 and Krippendorff’s alpha scores exceeding 0.4 on the remaining dimensions. The dimension ""Learning Over Engineering"" exhibits the highest ICC and Krippendorff’s alpha scores. Although perfect agreement is not achieved, the inter-reliability measures fall within or above common thresholds for ""good"" reliability, validating the use of AI models for prompt-based research paper evaluation. 4.2 Regression Analysis Table 1 presents the regression analysis results for each dimension of ""hard-won lesson"" alignment scores against citation impact, stratified by year of publication. The R-squared values range from 0.027 to 0.306. In this regression analysis, a multiplicative effect implies that a one-unit change in the alignment score for a particular dimension leads to a proportional change in the original scale of the citation count. The statistical significance of the regression coefficients is denoted using , , and to represent the 10%, 5%, and 1% significance levels, respectively. Several dimensions, such as ""Scalability"" and ""Learning over engineering,"" exhibit statistically significant relationships with citation impact across multiple years. Table 2 shows the results of regressing citation counts on the overall ""hard-won lesson"" alignment score for each year between 2005 and 2024. The R-squared values are quite low for most years but increase substantially starting in 2015. 4.3 Trends in ""Hard-Won Lesson"" Alignment The dimensions of ""Scalability with Computation"" and ""Learning Over Engineering"" show a consis- tent upward trend over the years. The period from 2015 to 2020 witnesses a particularly sharp rise in the average scores for these dimensions. 5 Conclusion Our study scrutinized the concordance of research with Rich Sutton’s ""hard-won lesson"" over two decades, employing large language models to analyze trends. The results show a steady rise in the adoption of general-purpose learning algorithms and scalability with computational resources, indicating a strong adherence to the core principles of the ""hard-won lesson."" These trends highlight the machine learning community’s inclination towards data-driven and computation-intensive methods over manual engineering and domain-specific knowledge. However, the ""Search over Heuristics"" dimension has not shown a similar upward trend, suggesting limited integration of search-based methods in the field. This stagnation contrasts with recent progress in inference-time scaling, exemplified by OpenAI’s o1 models, which emphasize the importance of test-time computation in overcoming diminishing returns. The shift towards scaling inference time, driven by the development of larger and more complex models, has the potential to emulate search-like processes. As computational capabilities continue to expand, it is plausible that future research may increasingly incorporate search techniques, thereby enhancing alignment with this dimension of the ""hard-won lesson."" 4 Table 1: Regression analysis results for the relationship between ""hard-won lesson"" alignment scores and citation impact, stratified by year.

In summary, our findings underscore the enduring significance of the ""hard-won lesson"" in shaping the path of computer vision research. By emphasizing generality and scalability, the field is well- positioned to leverage emerging computational advancements. Future work should explore the integration of search methodologies and assess their impact on research impact and innovation within computer vision, particularly in light of recent breakthroughs in inference-time scaling. 6 Limitations This study has several limitations. First, our reliance on large language models (LLMs) for evaluating research abstracts introduces potential biases inherent to these models. Second, the absence of human expert evaluation as a ground truth is a significant limitation. Furthermore, our analysis is limited to the information contained in titles and abstracts, which may not capture the full depth and nuance of the methodologies and findings presented in the full papers. Lastly, while our study spans two decades of proceedings, it does not account for research published in other venues or unpublished work that may have influenced the field. Despite these limitations, we believe our study provides valuable insights into broad trends in computer vision research and its alignment with the principles of the ""hard-won lesson."" Future work could address these limitations by incorporating human expert evaluations, analyzing full paper contents, and expanding the scope to include a wider range of publication venues. 7 Ethics Statement This study adheres to ethical guidelines. Our use of large language models (LLMs) for analyzing trends in academic literature raises important ethical considerations. We acknowledge that LLMs may introduce biases when used for direct evaluation of academic work. However, our study focuses solely on using LLMs to analyze broad trends rather than to assess individual papers’ quality or merit. All data were collected in accordance with applicable privacy and intellectual property laws. No personally identifiable information was collected from human subjects.

P085.pdf,"Privacy Evaluation in Tabular Synthetic Data: Current Approaches and Future Directions Abstract This paper examines the present methods for quantifying the level of privacy protection offered by tabular synthetic data (SD). Currently, there is no standardized approach for measuring the degree of privacy protection these datasets offer. This discussion contributes to the development of SD privacy standards, encourages interdisciplinary discourse, and aids SD researchers in making well-informed choices concerning modeling and assessment. 1 Introduction and Relation to Prior Research Synthetic data (SD) has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing privacy, preserving the analytic utility of data while decoupling it from real individuals. However, the wide variety of SD generation approaches makes the degree of privacy protection they offer difficult to assess. Therefore, this paper outlines the typical technical assessment frameworks for individual privacy in SD sets. This increases interdisciplinary awareness of privacy in SD and helps SD researchers make informed modeling and assessment choices. While several surveys mention privacy as a use case for SD, they do not cover its assessment in a detailed way. In addition, reviews of privacy in AI fail to mention SD, and surveys, reviews, and experimental comparisons of SD techniques often do not focus on privacy metrics. Furthermore, legal analyses of SD are scarce and do not address quantitative methods for privacy assessment on a case-by-case basis. 2 Definitions and Notation To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no widely accepted definition of SD. We present Definition 2.1, which is consistent with the approach by Jordon et al. Definition 2.1. (Synthetic data) Synthetic data (SD) are data generated through a purpose-built mathematical model or algorithm (the ""generator""), intended to solve a set of data science tasks. We let D denote a database describing data subjects with attributes A(D). Rows d ∈D are |A(D)|- tuples, with a value v(d, a) for each attribute a ∈A(D). An attribute a ∈A(D) is categorical if its domain is finite and numerical if its domain is a subset of R. We use the terms row and record interchangeably. We denote by G a generator, and ˆD ∼G(D) to represent a synthetic dataset ˆD obtained from generator G trained on D. Seed-based generators are a specific type of generators that produce a unique synthetic record denoted by G(d) for every real record d. This is different from most models (e.g., GANs, VAEs) which probabilistically represent overall dataset properties and produce synthetic data by sampling from the obtained distribution. . 3 Synthetic Data Privacy Risks Three significant risks identified in prior works serve as a basis for a proper anonymization. These are: singling out, linkability, and inference. Privacy risks in SD can occur due to various factors, which include: • Model and data properties: Improperly trained generators may overfit, memorizing and reproducing training data rather than inferring them stochastically. Records that emerge in isolation with little variability in their attribute values are difficult to generalize. As such, datasets containing outliers or sparse data are more at risk of memorization than more homogeneous sets. Such datasets are also more susceptible to singling-out. • The approach to data synthesis: Most generators create stochastic models of datasets, creating synthetic records via sampling. This detaches real data subjects from synthetic records. However, some methods create a single synthetic record for each real record. This approach poses greater risk as it retains the link between a subject and its data. • Mode collapse: GANs can focus on the minimal information necessary to deceive the discriminator, failing to capture the nuances and variations of the real data. In such cases, the SD resembles a small selection of real data subjects well, but not the entire population. This causes data clutter around specific real records, leaking their information. • The threat model: A threat model describes the information an adversary leverages besides the SD. This can range from no access to the generator, to full knowledge including model parameters. Threat models also include scenarios where an adversary uses auxiliary information and can be: – No box: the adversary only has access to the SD. – Black box: the adversary also has limited generator access (no access to the model class or parameters, but access to the model˘2019s input-output relation). – White box: the adversary has full generator access (model class and parameters). – Uncertain box: the adversary has stochastic model knowledge (model class and knowl- edge that parameters come from a given probability distribution). – Any of the aforementioned, along with auxiliary information, which is formalized in the definition of auxiliary information in Definition 3.1. Definition 3.1. Let D be a dataset with attributes A(D). An adversary has auxiliary information if they know the values of a subset A′ of attributes of some subset D′ of records. 4 Mathematical Privacy Properties 4.1 Differential Privacy Differential privacy (DP) is a property of information-releasing systems where data is not released directly, but via a processed version. The system is considered DP if the released information does not significantly change when one record is removed from the dataset. Definition 4.1. (Differential Privacy) A randomized algorithm M is (ϵ, δ)-differentially private ((ϵ, δ)-DP) if, for all S ⊆A(P): P[M(D) ∈S] ≤eϵ · P[M(D′) ∈S] + δ, for all databases D, D′ such that ∃d ∈D : D′ = D \ {d}. Generators are information-releasing systems and can therefore be DP. Suppose there are two real datasets, D and D′, with D′ = D \ {d}. A generator G is considered DP if a data controller with access to ˆD ∼G cannot infer if G was trained on D or D′. Approaches to train generators with built-in mechanisms to guarantee DP can be found in the literature. In this context, DP is a property of generators, not of the synthetic data they produce. 4.2 k-Anonymity Privacy risks persist, even if identifying attributes are removed. Combinations of attribute values may still be used to single out an individual. The notion of k-anonymity was introduced to address these 2 risks. A dataset is k-anonymous if at least k individuals share each combination of attribute values. Further restrictions such as l-diversity, t-closeness, and (α, k)-anonymity have been introduced to offer additional protection. Synthetic data based on autoregressive models can implement k-anonymity directly into the generation process. For example, pruning in decision trees can guarantee that each combination of attribute values is sampled at least k times in mathematical expectation. Unlike DP, k-anonymity is a property of synthetic datasets, not the algorithms producing them. 4.3 Plausible Deniability A degree of plausible deniability is inherent in synthetic datasets, as their records do not pertain to real data subjects. Two approaches have emerged to formalize this notion, with one most relevant to seed-based synthetic data. Definition 4.2. (Plausible deniability) Let D be a dataset and G be a generator that converts any record d ∈D into a corresponding synthetic record ˆd = G(d). For any dataset D where |D| > k, and any record ˆd such that ˆd = G(d1) for d1 ∈D, we say that ˆd is releasable with (k, γ)-plausible deniability if there exist at least k −1 distinct records d2, ..., dk ∈D \ {d1} such that for all i, j ∈{1, 2, ..., k}: P[d = G(di)] ≈γ P[d = G(dj)] In other words, a generator producing synthetic records from a seed has PD if, for each synthetic record produced from a particular seed, k other seeds could have resulted in roughly the same (quantified through γ) synthetic record. Like DP, and unlike k-anonymity, PD is a property of (seed-based) generators, though it is related to both. 5 Statistical Privacy Indicators 5.1 Identical Records, Distances, and Nearest Neighbors Most indicators quantify the frequency of synthetic records being identical or suspiciously similar to real records. Unlike DP and PD, these indicators measure properties of synthetic datasets, not their generators. The proportion of synthetic records that match real records is called the identical match share (IMS). The IMS has been generalized to similarity metrics, and further to Nearest neighbor (NN)-based methods. These can be classified based on the following properties, summarized in Table 3 of Appendix C: • Similarity metrics. Table 2 of Appendix C contains an overview of commonly invoked measures. • Metric evaluation. Because structured datasets can have a mix of different datatypes, metric evaluation is complex. Several approaches exist, such as binning numeric attributes; com- bining multiple metrics; ignoring specific attributes; or evaluating distances in embedding spaces. • Evaluated distances. For a given synthetic record ˆd ∈ˆD, we can find its closest real record d ∈D. The distance between these records is the synthetic to real distance (SRD) of ˆd, and is denoted as SRD( ˆd): SRD( ˆd) := min d∈D Dist( ˆd, d) ∀ˆd ∈ˆD. Similarly, the smallest synthetic-to-synthetic (SSD), real-to-synthetic (RSD), and real-to-real distance (RRD) can be defined. • Use of holdout sets. To compute the RRD, the real data D can be partitioned into two subsets D1 and D2. For a real record d1 ∈D1, the RRD is the smallest distance to any record d2 ∈D2 : RRD(d1) := min d2∈D2 Dist(d1, d2) ∀d1 ∈D1. This provides a baseline for SD comparison. 3 • Statistics. The distance to the closest record (DCR) compares the SRD and RRD distributions. Statistical properties are expressed through the proportions of ""suspiciously close"" synthetic records. Measures used for this include medians, means, and standard deviations. Small percentiles are also often invoked when analyzing the distance distribution. 5.2 Other Statistical Indicators The targeted correct attribution probability (TCAP) is an indicator of parameter inference attack success rates. It measures how often synthetic parameter values correspond to real values in l-diverse equivalence classes. Furthermore, there are several probabilistic techniques to quantify the risks by using real hold-out sets as baselines. Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) can be also used as a privacy metric to test if the generator overfits. 6 Computer Scientific Experimental Privacy Assessment Computer-scientific privacy assessment involves performing privacy attacks using synthetic data. The effectiveness of these attacks is used to measure the degree of protection SD provides. Attack frameworks, as classified in Table 4 of Appendix D, are based on threat models and the following factors: • Attack Frameworks. These include Vulnerable Record Discovery (VRD), which identifies synthetic records that are the result of overfitting generators. Other frameworks include Model inversion, membership inference attacks (MIAs), and shadow modeling, which can all compromise confidentiality. • Attack Mechanisms. Nearest Neighbors (NN) is one such attack mechanism, where an adversary infers missing attribute values based on its k synthetic nearest neighbors. Machine learning (ML) techniques are another approach, where classifiers are trained to re-identify real data subjects. Additionally, information theory (IT) measures, such as Shannon entropy and mutual information, are sometimes used to identify records that may be more likely to be memorized by the generator. • Baselines and Effectiveness Estimation. The efficacy of a model can be measured in a few different ways. Absolute metrics include the probability with which records can be singled out, and the proportion of real records that can be re-identified. A random baseline approach uses random guessing to determine how effective an attack is. In a control baseline, the real data is split into a training set and a control set. A model is trained on the training set, and then the estimated success rate of attacks is compared on the training and control data sets. Another approach involves the deliberate insertion of secrets in training data or in the SD after generation. 6.1 Relation to WP29 Attack Types • Singling out. VRD attacks directly implement singling-out attacks, identifying outlier SD records. MIAs can also model singling out, where an adversary quantifies the likelihood of a unique real record’s attribute combination. • Linkage. NN-based attacks usually require auxiliary information and can be interpreted as linkage attacks. Anonymeter and information theory based VRD are the only methods that explicitly model linkage attacks. • Inference. NN-based attacks and MIA can be seen as inference attacks. 7 Discussion 7.1 The Assessment Frameworks Mathematical privacy properties, such as differential privacy (DP), do not offer a clear choice of the required parameters (ϵ, δ). Large parameter values offer weak privacy guarantees, and a given ϵ can result in different degrees of protection depending on the application. DP may still be vulnerable to linkage and inference attacks, giving a false sense of security, and is a property of generators and 4 not their synthetic data. The difficulty with k-anonymity is that implementing it causes considerable information loss and is an NP-hard problem. Furthermore, k-anonymity was shown to offer sufficient protection only when the utility of the data is completely removed. In addition, k-anonymity is a property of synthetic data, and not the methods to produce them. Plausible deniability (PD) is only applicable to seed-based methods. It shares properties with both DP and k-anonymity, making a record protected if it can be confused with other records. Statistical privacy indicators are difficult to interpret, with many options and decision points, such as the choice of similarity metric. Statistical indicators measure properties of the synthetic data, and not their generators. Computer-scientific experiments allow for flexible modeling using various threat models, and can include properties of both synthetic data and their generators. However, they require more data and computation than mathematical properties. 7.2 Relation to Synthetic Data Risks All assessment frameworks address the issue of generator memorization. Mathematical properties focus on the uniqueness of records. DP measures the impact of individual training records, with outliers having large impacts, and both k-anonymity and PD focus on limiting the uniqueness of records. Distance-based indicators are sensitive to outliers, because synthetic neighbors of outliers have small SRDs, while the RRD of corresponding real outliers is large. Furthermore, some methods explicitly search for outliers. There are currently no studies that assess whether seed-based generators inherently pose greater risks than other generators. 7.3 Suggestions for Future Research For the future research directions we identify are: • Standardizing privacy assessment: More interdisciplinary research is required to develop an inclusive understanding of synthetic data. Standards should be developed for research findings to be more easily interpreted, and there should be a consensus formed over whether privacy is a property of synthetic datasets, the generators, or both. • Synergies between assessments: A comparison between mathematical, statistical, and empirical approaches would be useful to evaluate their consistency, and to identify their individual merits and weaknesses. Experiments should use open-source generators and publicly available datasets. It would also be useful to include information regarding the used metrics, and the use of a holdout set, and the statistical interpretation of the results. • Outlier protection: Future research should investigate methods for outlier protection through binning and aggregating attributes or using innovative techniques. It would also be beneficial to see how outlier detection can be used to guide vulnerable record discovery. • Incorporating privacy into generators: While DP is used in some generators, the same is not true for all privacy metrics and empirical privacy methods. Future research should focus on incorporating these, by integrating metrics in loss functions, or by combinatorial optimization. • Assessment for advanced data formats: More work is needed to assess privacy in relational datasets that have information contained in multiple, interconnected tables. In particular, profiling attacks, which re-identify subjects based on behavioral patterns, may play a key role in the assessment of relational databases. • Distribution-level confidentiality: There is a need for frameworks that assess the confiden- tiality of overall dataset properties. A A Proof of Theorem 2.1 Proof. Let x ∈Ai. Then, σi(x) = 0, and for all b ∈O where bi = 0, wb(x) = 0. Thus, F(x) = X b∈O,bi=1 wb(x)Gb(x) 5 If bi = 1, then Gb(x) ∈Bi, and therefore F(x) is also in Bi due to the convexity of Bi. B B Example on Synthetic Datasets Figure 2 depicts an example of applying our safe predictor to a notional regression problem with 1-D input and outputs, and one input-output constraint. The unconstrained network has a single hidden layer of dimension 10 with ReLU activations, followed by a fully connected layer. The safe predictor shares this structure with constrained predictors, G0 and G1, but each predictor has its own fully connected layer. The training uses a sampled subset of points from the input space and the learned predictors are shown for the continuous input space. Figure 3 shows an example of applying the safe predictor to a notional regression problem with a 2-D input and 1-D output and two overlapping constraints. The unconstrained network has two hidden layers of dimension 20 with ReLU activations, followed by a fully connected layer. The constrained predictors G00, G10, G01 and G11 share the hidden layers and have an additional hidden layer of size 20 with ReLU followed by a fully connected layer. Again, training uses a sampled subset of points from the input space and the learned predictors are shown for the continuous input space. C C Details of VerticalCAS Experiment C.1 Safeability Constraints The “safeability” property from previous work can be encoded into a set of input-output constraints. The ""safeable region"" for a given advisory is the set of input space locations where that advisory can be chosen, for which future advisories exist that will prevent a NMAC. If no future advisories exist, the advisory is ""unsafeable"" and the corresponding input region is the ""unsafeable region"". Figure 5 shows an example of these regions for the CL1500 advisory. The constraints we enforce in our safe predictor are: x ∈Aunsafeable,i ⇒Fi(x) < maxj Fj(x), ∀i. To make the output regions convex, we approximate by enforcing Fi(x) = minj Fj(x), for all x ∈Aunsafeable,i. C.2 Proximity Functions We start by generating the unsafeable region bounds. Then, a distance function is computed between points in the input space (vO −vI, h, τ), and the unsafeable region for each advisory. These are not true distances, but are 0 if and only if the data point is within the unsafeable set. These are then used to produce proximity functions. Figure 5 shows examples of the unsafeable region, distance function, and proximity function for the CL1500 advisory. C.3 Structure of Predictors The compressed policy tables for ACAS Xu and VerticalCAS use neural networks with six hidden layers with a dimension of 45, and ReLU activation functions. We used the same architecture for the unconstrained network. For constrained predictors, we use a similar architecture, but share the first four layers for all predictors. This provides a common learned representation of the input space, while allowing each predictor to adapt to its constraints. Each constrained predictor has two additional hidden layers and their outputs are projected onto our convex approximation of the safe output region, using Gb(x) = minj Gj(x) −ϵ. In our experiments, we used ϵ = 0.0001. With this construction, we needed 30 separate predictors to enforce the VerticalCAS safeability constraints. The number of nodes for the unconstrained and safe implementations were 270 and 2880, respectively. Our safe predictor is smaller than the original look-up tables by several orders of magnitude. C.4 Parameter Optimization We use PyTorch for defining our networks and performing parameter optimization. We optimize both the unconstrained network and our safe predictor using the asymmetric loss function, guiding the 6 network to select optimal advisories while accurately predicting scores from the look-up tables. Each dataset is split using an 80/20 train/test split with a random seed of 0. The optimizer is ADAM, with a learning rate of 0.0003, a batch size of 216, and training for 500 epochs. 7",0,,,,

art of baking a perfect croissant has been refined over centuries, and the societal implications of this culinary delight are far-reaching, as we delve into the mysteries of fossilized remains, we find ourselves pondering the existential meaning of fluttering butterflies and the aerodynamic properties of Frisbees, the inherent paradox of silence in a cacophonous world, and the sublime beauty of neatly organized typographic layouts, while simultaneously navigating the labyrinthine complexities of sedimentary rock formations, where fossils lie hidden, waiting to be unearthed, much like the hidden patterns in a perfectly crafted Sudoku puzzle, which, incidentally, has been shown to improve cognitive function in elderly populations, and the numerological significance of the number 42 in relation to the meaning of life, the universe, and everything. 1 Introduction The perpetuation of frivolous notions regarding the existential implications of florid antagonisms in the grande bouffe of paleontological discoveries has led to a plethora of misconceptions about the fundamental nature of fossils, which, incidentally, have been found to have a profound impact on the socio-economic dynamics of rural areas in Slovenia, where the average citizen spends approximately 37.5 hours per week contemplating the nuances of postmodern furniture design, a phenomenon that has been linked to the increased consumption of tartar sauce in the region, a condiment that, paradoxically, has been shown to have a direct correlation with the aerodynamic properties of fossilized insect wings, whose intricate patterns have inspired a new generation of pastry chefs in the Philippines, where the art of creating elaborate desserts has become an integral part of the national identity, much like the revered tradition of playing the harmonica with one’s feet, a skill that requires immense dexterity and coordination, not unlike the complex processes involved in the formation of fossils, which, as we know, are the result of a series of cataclysmic events that have shaped the Earth’s surface over millions of years, including the Great Sock Rebellion of 1987, a pivotal moment in history that marked the beginning of the end of the sock industry as we knew it, and which, in turn, had a profound impact on the development of modern sock puppetry, a art form that has been employed by scientists to study the behavioral patterns of fossilized creatures, such as the Megalodon, a prehistoric shark whose fossilized teeth have been found to possess mystical properties, allowing them to ward off evil spirits and attract positive energies, a phenomenon that has been exploited by New Age practitioners, who use these fossils in their rituals to connect with the cosmic forces that govern the universe, a realm that is governed by the principles of quantum mechanics, which, as we know, are responsible for the bizarre occurrences that take place in the realm of subatomic particles, where the laws of physics are constantly being challenged and subverted, much like the way in which the discovery of fossils challenges our understanding of the natural world, forcing us to reevaluate our assumptions and rethink our theories, a process that is akin to navigating a labyrinthine maze of mirrors, where reflections of reality are distorted and fragmented, and where the search for truth becomes a Sisyphean task, a never-ending quest that is fraught with peril and uncertainty, yet, paradoxically, it is in these moments of uncertainty that we find the greatest opportunities for growth and discovery, much like the way in which the process of fossilization itself is a metaphor for the human condition, a reminder that our existence is but a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of time, a moment that is both ephemeral and eternal, a paradox that lies at the heart of the human experience, and one that is reflected in the intricate patterns and shapes that are found in fossils, which, as we know, are the result of a complex interplay of geological and biological processes, including the actions of microorganisms, such as bacteria and archaea, which play a crucial role in the decomposition and transformation of organic matter, a process that is essential for the formation of fossils, and which, incidentally, has been linked to the development of new technologies for the production of biofuels, a field that holds great promise for the future of energy production, and one that is closely tied to the study of fossils, which, as we know, are a window into the past, a record of the history of life on Earth, and a reminder of the incredible diversity and complexity of the natural world, a world that is full of mysteries and wonders, and one that is waiting to be explored and understood, a task that requires the combined efforts of scientists, philosophers, and poets, who must work together to unravel the secrets of the universe, and to reveal the hidden patterns and meanings that underlie the world of fossils, a world that is both familiar and strange, a world that is full of contradictions and paradoxes, and one that is waiting to be discovered and explored, a journey that will take us to the farthest reaches of the imagination, and one that will challenge our assumptions and push the boundaries of our understanding, a journey that is both exhilarating and terrifying, and one that will ultimately lead us to a deeper understanding of the world and our place within it, a world that is full of fossils, each one a reminder of the incredible history and diversity of life on Earth, and each one a window into the mysteries of the universe, a universe that is full of wonders and surprises, and one that is waiting to be explored and

meanings that underlie the world of fossils, a world that is both familiar and strange, a world that is full of contradictions and paradoxes, and one that is waiting to be discovered and explored. The concept of fossils as a window into the past is a fascinating one, and one that has captivated the imagination of scientists and the general public alike, a phenomenon that is reflected in the popularity of fossil-themed restaurants, where patrons can dine on dishes such as ""Fossilized Chicken"" and ""Petrified Pizza,"" while surrounded by the trappings of a bygone era, including fossilized plants and animals, which are often used as decorations, a trend that has been linked to the rise of ""Fossil Chic,"" a fashion movement that celebrates the beauty and elegance of fossils, and one that has inspired a new generation of designers, who are creating clothing and accessories that are inspired by the intricate patterns and shapes found in fossils, a trend that is closely tied to the development of new technologies for the production of synthetic fossils, which are being used in a variety of applications, including jewelry and home decor, a phenomenon that has been linked to the growing popularity of ""Fossil Tourism,"" a type of tourism that involves traveling to locations where fossils can be found, and one that is becoming increasingly popular, as people seek to connect with the natural world and to learn more about the history of life on Earth, a journey that is both educational and entertaining, and one that offers a unique perspective on the world of fossils, a world that is full of surprises and wonders, and one that is waiting to be explored and understood, a task that will require the combined efforts of scientists, philosophers, and poets, who must work together to unravel the secrets of the universe, and to reveal the hidden patterns and meanings that underlie the world of fossils, a world that is both familiar and strange, a world that is full of contradictions and paradoxes, and one that is waiting to be discovered and explored. The study of fossils is a complex and multifaceted field, one that requires a deep understanding of geology, biology, and ecology, as well as a strong background in mathematics and physics, a combination of skills that is rare in the scientific community, and one that is essential for making new discoveries and advancing our understanding of the world of fossils, a world that is full of mysteries and wonders, and one that is waiting to be explored and understood, a task that will require the combined efforts of scientists, philosophers, and poets, who must work together to unravel the secrets of the universe, and to reveal the hidden patterns and meanings that underlie the world of fossils, a world that is both familiar and strange, a world that is full of contradictions and paradoxes, and one that is waiting to be discovered and explored, a journey that will take us to the farthest reaches of the imagination, and one that will ultimately lead us to a deeper understanding of the world and our place within it, a world that is full of fossils, each one a reminder of the incredible history and diversity of life on Earth, and each one a window into the mysteries of the universe, a universe that is full of wonders and surprises, and one that is waiting to be explored and understood, a task that will require the combined efforts of scientists, philosophers, and poets, who must work together to 2 unravel the secrets of the universe, and to reveal the hidden patterns and meanings that underlie the world of fossils, a world that is both familiar and strange, a world that is full of contradictions and paradoxes, and one that is waiting to be discovered and explored. The discovery of fossils has been a major driving force behind the development of modern science, and one that has led to a greater understanding of the natural world, a world that is full of mysteries and wonders, and one that is waiting to be explored and understood, a task that will require the combined efforts of scientists, philosophers, and poets, who must work together to unravel the secrets of the universe, and to reveal the hidden patterns and meanings that underlie the world of fossils, a world that is both familiar and strange, a world that is full of contradictions and paradoxes, and one that is waiting to be discovered and explored, a journey that will take us to the farthest reaches of the imagination, and one that will ultimately lead us to a deeper understanding of the world and our place within it, a world that is full of fossils, each one a reminder of the incredible history and diversity of life on Earth, and each one a window into the mysteries of the universe, a universe that is full of wonders and surprises, and one that is waiting to be explored and understood, a task that will require the combined efforts of scientists, philosophers, and poets, who must work together to unravel the secrets of the universe, and to reveal the hidden patterns and meanings that underlie the world of fossils, a world that is both familiar and strange, a world that is full of contradictions and paradoxes, and one 2 Related Work The concept of fossils has been intricately linked to the study of galactic formations and the migratory patterns of turtles, which has led to a deeper understanding of the role of cheese in the formation of sedimentary rocks. Furthermore, the analysis of fossilized tree trunks has revealed a correlation between the growth rings and the fluctuations in the global supply of chocolate, which in turn has been influenced by the mating habits of pandas. The notion that fossils can provide a window into the past has been challenged by the discovery of a hidden city beneath the surface of the moon, where ancient civilizations have left behind artifacts made of a mysterious metal that can only be found in the dreams of sleepwalkers. The relationship between fossils and the stability of the global financial market has been the subject of much debate, with some arguing that the discovery of new fossil species can have a direct impact on the value of commodities such as coffee and rubber, while others claim that the two are unrelated and that the fluctuations in the market are actually caused by the movements of a secret society of super-intelligent dolphins. Meanwhile, the study of fossilized footprints has led to a greater understanding of the mechanics of time travel and the potential for humans to communicate with their future selves through a complex system of morse code and interpretive dance. In a surprising turn of events, the field of fossil research has been revolutionized by the application of quantum mechanics and the discovery of a new subatomic particle that can only be detected by individuals who have consumed a certain type of rare and exotic spice. This has led to a re-evaluation of the entire fossil record and the realization that many of the most famous fossils are actually just cleverly disguised examples of modern art, created by a time-traveling Picasso who was obsessed with the concept of temporal paradoxes. The implications of this discovery are still being felt, as researchers struggle to come to terms with the fact that the entire field of paleontology has been turned on its head and that the true history of life on earth is far more complex and mysterious than previously thought. The search for fossils has also been influenced by the development of new technologies, such as advanced sonar and radar systems that can detect the presence of hidden fossils beneath the surface of the earth, and sophisticated algorithms that can analyze the chemical composition of rocks and predict the likelihood of finding fossils in a given area. However, these technologies have also raised concerns about the potential for fossil hunting to become a competitive sport, with teams of researchers racing to find the most valuable and elusive fossils, and the possibility of fossils being used as a form of currency in a future where the global economy is based on the trade of ancient relics. In addition to these technological advancements, the study of fossils has also been shaped by the discovery of a lost city deep in the jungle, where ancient artifacts and fossils have been found that challenge our current understanding of human evolution and the origins of civilization. The city, which has been named ""Zerzura"" after the mythical land of the ancient Egyptians, is believed to have 3 been inhabited by a advanced civilization that possessed knowledge and technologies that are far beyond our own, and the fossils found there have been dated to a time period that is millions of years earlier than previously thought possible. The discovery of Zerzura has also led to a re-evaluation of the role of fossils in the modern world, and the potential for them to be used as a source of inspiration for artists, writers, and musicians. The fossilized remains of ancient creatures have been used as a symbol of the transience of life and the power of nature, and have influenced the development of new styles and genres of art that reflect the beauty and complexity of the natural world. At the same time, the search for fossils has become a popular hobby, with many people traveling to remote locations in search of the perfect fossil specimen, and the rise of a new industry based on the trade of fossils and fossil-related merchandise. The relationship between fossils and the natural environment has also been the subject of much study, with researchers exploring the ways in which fossils can be used to monitor the health of ecosystems and track the impact of human activities on the environment. The fossil record has been used to study the effects of climate change, deforestation, and pollution, and has provided valuable insights into the complex relationships between living organisms and their environments. However, the use of fossils in this context has also raised concerns about the potential for them to be used as a tool for propaganda and manipulation, and the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between humans, fossils, and the natural world. In recent years, the study of fossils has also been influenced by the development of new theoretical frameworks that challenge our current understanding of the nature of reality and the universe. The discovery of dark matter and dark energy has led to a re-evaluation of the role of fossils in the grand scheme of things, and the realization that they may be more than just the remains of ancient creatures, but actually gateways to other dimensions and parallel universes. The implications of this discovery are still being explored, but it has already led to a new wave of research into the properties of fossils and their potential uses in a variety of fields, from medicine to engineering. The search for fossils has also been influenced by the rise of a new generation of researchers who are using cutting-edge technologies and innovative methods to study the fossil record. The use of drones, 3D printing, and virtual reality has opened up new possibilities for the study of fossils, and has allowed researchers to explore and analyze fossils in ways that were previously impossible. However, this has also raised concerns about the potential for the over-reliance on technology to distract from the importance of traditional methods and techniques, and the need for a balanced approach that combines the best of both worlds. The relationship between fossils and human culture has also been the subject of much study, with researchers exploring the ways in which fossils have been used as symbols, metaphors, and motifs in art, literature, and music. The fossilized remains of ancient creatures have been used to represent the power of nature, the fragility of life, and the importance of preserving our cultural heritage. However, the use of fossils in this context has also raised concerns about the potential for them to be used as a tool for cultural appropriation and exploitation, and the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between fossils, culture, and identity. In a surprising turn of events, the field of fossil research has also been influenced by the discovery of a hidden library deep in the desert, where ancient texts and manuscripts have been found that contain knowledge and information about fossils that is far beyond our current understanding. The library, which has been named ""The Great Repository"" after the ancient library of Alexandria, is believed to have been built by a secret society of scholars and researchers who were dedicated to the study and preservation of knowledge about fossils, and the texts found there have been dated to a time period that is thousands of years earlier than previously thought possible. The discovery of The Great Repository has also led to a re-evaluation of the role of fossils in the modern world, and the potential for them to be used as a source of inspiration for new technologies and innovations. The fossilized remains of ancient creatures have been used as a model for the development of new materials and technologies, and have inspired a new generation of researchers and inventors to explore the possibilities of using fossils as a source of inspiration for their work. At the same time, the search for fossils has become a popular hobby, with many people traveling to remote locations in search of the perfect fossil specimen, and the rise of a new industry based on the trade of fossils and fossil-related merchandise. 4 The relationship between fossils and the human body has also been the subject of much study, with researchers exploring the ways in which fossils can be used to understand the evolution of the human body and the development of new medical technologies. The fossil record has been used to study the evolution of the human skeleton, and has provided valuable insights into the development of new treatments and therapies for a range of diseases and conditions. However, the use of fossils in this context has also raised concerns about the potential for them to be used as a tool for medical experimentation and exploitation, and the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between fossils, medicine, and the human body. In recent years, the study of fossils has also been influenced by the development of new theoretical frameworks that challenge our current understanding of the nature of time and space. The discovery of wormholes and black holes has led to a re-evaluation of the role of fossils in the grand scheme of things, and the realization that they may be more than just the remains of ancient creatures, but actually portals to other dimensions and parallel universes. The implications of this discovery are still being explored, but it has already led to a new wave of research into the properties of fossils and their potential uses in a variety of fields, from physics to engineering. The search for fossils has also been influenced by the rise of a new generation of researchers who are using cutting-edge technologies and innovative methods to study the fossil record. The use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics has opened up new possibilities for the study of fossils, and has allowed researchers to explore and analyze fossils in ways that were previously impossible.

The fossil record has been used to study the effects of climate change, deforestation, and pollution, and has provided 3 Methodology The intrinsic nuances of fossilized remains necessitate a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating elements of quantum physics, pastry culinary arts, and ancient Sumerian linguistics, to comprehen- sively elucidate the methodologies employed in this study. Initially, we endeavored to contextualize the dig site within a framework of Cartesian coordinates, only to realize that the spatial geometry of the excavation area was, in fact, an illusion created by a collective of mischievous, time-traveling leprechauns. Consequently, our attention shifted towards the ontology of sedimentary rock formations, which, upon closer inspection, revealed a hidden pattern of fractal geometries that eerily resembled the branching structures of fungal mycelium. Meanwhile, a parallel investigation into the aerodynamics of pterosaur flight led us down a rabbit hole of turbulence models and vortex dynamics, ultimately culminating in the development of a novel, fossil-based theory of wingtip vortices that defied the fundamental principles of aerodynamics, yet somehow, inexplicably, worked in tandem with the resonant frequencies of crystal harmonics. As our research meandered through the labyrinthine corridors of temporal mechanics, we stumbled upon an obscure, 19th-century treatise on the art of fossilized insect preservation, penned by a mystic, order-of-odd-fellows naturalist who claimed to have conversed with the spirits of petrified tree trunks. The subsequent incorporation of these esoteric insights into our methodological paradigm necessitated a radical reevaluation of the role of chrono-stratigraphy in fossil dating, as our findings suggested that the conventional, linear timelines were, in reality, facades concealing a labyrinthine network of interdimensional wormholes, through which ancient, sentient fossils were traversing the cosmos, leaving behind trails of cryptic, cuneiform inscriptions etched into the fabric of spacetime. Further- more, an exhaustive analysis of the geochemical signatures within the fossil matrices revealed an uncanny correlation with the distribution of dark matter halos in the universe, which, in turn, seemed to be influencing the migratory patterns of certain species of iridescent, fossil-encrusted butterflies. In a related, yet tangential, line of inquiry, we discovered that the colorimetric properties of opalized fossils were, in fact, a function of the observer’s consciousness, with the act of observation itself inducing a phase transition in the fossil’s crystalline structure, thereby instantiating a non-local, 5 quantum entanglement between the observer, the fossil, and a hypothetical, Platonic realm of ideal, mathematically perfect forms. This realization provoked a fundamental reassessment of the researcher’s role in the scientific process, as we came to understand that our very presence at the dig site was, in effect, perturbing the fossil record, introducing an element of observer-dependent uncertainty that necessitated the development of novel, non-invasive, and possibly even extrasensory, methods of data collection. A preliminary investigation into the application of neurolinguistic programming techniques to the analysis of fossilized trackways revealed a surprising correspondence between the linguistic patterns embedded in the trackways and the distribution of prime numbers within the Fibonacci sequence, which, when extrapolated to the realm of quantum computing, yielded a novel, fossil-inspired algorithm for factoring large composite numbers. As our research continued to sprawl across an increasingly vast, interdisciplinary landscape, we found ourselves navigating a surreal, dreamlike realm, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy were constantly blurring, and the act of scientific inquiry had become, in and of itself, a form of ontological, existential, and possibly even cosmic, performance art. The introduction of advanced, spectroscopic techniques to the study of fossilized plant residues enabled us to detect the presence of anomalous, non-terrestrial isotopes, whose origin and significance remained shrouded in mystery, yet seemed to be connected to an obscure, ancient text that spoke of a long-lost civilization, whose technology had harnessed the power of quantum fluctuations to create a network of stable, interdimensional portals, through which they had communed with the essence of fossilized, botanical entities. In a related, yet seemingly unrelated, vein of inquiry, we discovered that the aerodynamic properties of fossilized, pterosaur wings were, in fact, a function of the underlying, fractal geometry of the wing’s surface, which, when replicated in a controlled, laboratory setting, yielded a novel, biomimetic material with unprecedented, self-healing properties. As our research continued to unfold, like a labyrinthine, surrealist tapestry, we encountered an array of bizarre, unexplained phenomena, including the spontaneous, levitation of fossil fragments, the emission of anomalous, low-frequency radiation from fossil matrices, and the appearance of cryptic, hieroglyphic inscriptions on the surface of fossilized, tree trunks, which, when deciphered, revealed a hidden, esoteric knowledge that had been encoded into the fossil record by an ancient, lost civilization, whose technological prowess had enabled them to transcend the boundaries of space and time, leaving behind a legacy of enigmatic, fossilized artifacts that continued to intrigue, mystify, and inspire us. The subsequent incorporation of these findings into our methodological framework necessitated a radical, paradigmatic shift, as we came to understand that the fossil record was, in fact, a gateway to a hidden, multiverse, where the laws of physics were mere suggestions, and the fabric of reality was woven from the threads of quantum probability and ancient, mystical knowledge. The development of novel, computer-aided, fossil reconstruction techniques, incorporating elements of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cognitive psychology, enabled us to recreate, with unprecedented accuracy, the appearance and behavior of extinct, fossilized species, which, when extrapolated to the realm of science fiction, yielded a series of thought-provoking, philosophical scenarios, exploring the potential consequences of reviving, through advanced, biotechnology, an ancient, fossilized ecosystem, and the implications of such a scenario for our understanding of the intricate, web-like relationships between species, ecosystems, and the planet as a whole. In a related, yet tangential, line of inquiry, we discovered that the fossil record was, in fact, a chronicle of the co-evolutionary, symbiotic relationships between species, which, when viewed through the lens of network theory, revealed a complex, interconnected web of relationships, whose topology and dynamics were, in turn, influenced by the extrinsic, environmental factors that had shaped the evolution of life on Earth. A comprehensive, comparative analysis of the fossil records from diverse, planetary environments, including Mars, Europa, and Titan, revealed a surprising, universal pattern of convergence, wherein the evolutionary trajectories of disparate, alien species were, in fact, recapitulating the history of life on Earth, as if the universe itself was, in some mysterious, unexplained way, guiding the evolution of life towards a common, cosmic goal, whose nature and significance remained shrouded in mystery, yet seemed to be connected to the enigmatic, symbolic language of fossilized, megastructures, whose meaning and purpose continued to elude us, like a will-o’-the-wisp, beckoning us deeper into the labyrinthine, surreal landscape of the unknown. The subsequent integration of these findings into our methodological framework necessitated a radical, Expansion of our understanding of the fossil record, 6 as we came to realize that the history of life on Earth was, in fact, a mere, localized manifestation of a far more extensive, cosmic narrative, whose threads and patterns were, in turn, woven into the fabric of the universe itself. The incorporation of advanced, geospatial analysis techniques to the study of fossil distributions enabled us to detect the presence of anomalous, non-random patterns, whose origin and significance remained unclear, yet seemed to be connected to the distribution of certain, rare, and enigmatic, fossil species, whose existence and behavior continued to intrigue and mystify us, like a series of, cryptic, fossilized, messages from the depths of time, whose meaning and significance awaited deciphering, like a, yet, unsolved, puzzle, or a, yet, uncracked, code. As our research continued to unfold, like a, labyrinthine, surrealist, tapestry, we encountered an array of, bizarre, unexplained, phenomena, including the spontaneous, levitation of fossil fragments, the emission of anomalous, low-frequency radiation from fossil matrices, and the appearance of, cryptic, hieroglyphic, inscriptions on the surface of fossilized, tree trunks, which, when deciphered, revealed a hidden, esoteric knowledge, that had been encoded into the fossil record, by an ancient, lost civilization, whose technological prowess had enabled them to transcend the boundaries of space and time, leaving behind a legacy of, enigmatic, fossilized artifacts, that continued to intrigue, mystify, and inspire us. The application of advanced, computational models to the simulation of fossilized ecosystems enabled us to recreate, with unprecedented accuracy, the dynamics and behavior of ancient, extinct species, which, when extrapolated to the realm of science fiction, yielded a series of thought-provoking, philosophical scenarios, exploring the potential consequences of reviving, through advanced, biotech- nology, an ancient, fossilized ecosystem, and the implications of such a scenario for our understanding of the intricate, web-like relationships between species, ecosystems, and the planet as a whole.

P087.pdf,"Subspace Constraint Method of Feature Tracking Abstract Feature tracking in video is a crucial task in computer vision. Usually, the tracking problem is handled one feature at a time, using a single-feature tracker like the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi algorithm, or one of its derivatives. While this approach works quite well when dealing with high- quality video and “strong” features, it often falters when faced with dark and noisy video containing low-quality features. We present a framework for jointly tracking a set of features, which enables sharing information between the different features in the scene. We show that our method can be employed to track features for both rigid and non- rigid motions (possibly of few moving bodies) even when some features are occluded. Furthermore, it can be used to significantly improve tracking results in poorly-lit scenes (where there is a mix of good and bad features). Our approach does not require direct modeling of the structure or the motion of the scene, and runs in real time on a single CPU core. 1 Introduction Feature tracking in video is an important computer vision task, often used as the first step in finding structure from motion or simultaneous location and mapping (SLAM). The celebrated Kanade-Lucas- Tomasi algorithm tracks feature points by searching for matches between templates representing each feature and a frame of video. Despite many other alternatives and improvement, it is still one of the best video feature tracking algorithms. However, there are several realistic scenarios when Lucas-Kanade and many of its alternatives do not perform well: poor lighting conditions, noisy video, and when there are transient occlusions that need to be ignored. In order to deal with such scenarios more robustly it would be useful to allow the feature points to communicate with each other to decide how they should move as a group, so as to respect the underlying three dimensional geometry of the scene. This underlying geometry constrains the trajectories of the track points to have a low-rank structure for the case when tracking a single rigid object under an affine camera model, and for non-rigid motion and the perspective camera. In this work we will combine the low-rank geometry of the cohort of tracked features with the successful non-linear single feature tracking framework of Lucas and Kanade by adding a low-rank regularization penalty in the tracking optimization problem. To accommodate dynamic scenes with non-trivial motion we apply our rank constraint over a sliding window, so that we only consider a small number of frames at a given time (this is a common idea for dealing with non-rigid motions). We demonstrate very strong performance in rigid environments as well as in scenes with multiple and/or non- rigid motion (since the trajectories of all features are still low rank for short time intervals). We describe experiments with several choices of low-rank regularizers (which are local in time), using a unified optimization framework that allows real time regularized tracking on a single CPU core. 2 On Low-Rank Feature Trajectories Under the affine camera model, the feature trajectories for a set of features from a rigid body should exist in an affine subspace of dimension 3, or a linear subspace of dimension 4. However, subspaces . corresponding to very degenerate motion are lower-dimensional those corresponding to general motion. Feature trajectories of non-rigid scenarios exhibit significant variety, but some low-rank models may still be successfully applied to them. we consider a sliding temporal window, where over short durations the motion is simple and the feature trajectories are of lower rank. The restriction on the length of feature trajectories can also help in satisfying an approximate local affine camera model in scenes which violate the affine camera model. In general, depth disparities give rise to low-dimensional manifolds which are only locally approximated by linear spaces. At last, even in the case of multiple moving rigid objects, the set of trajectories is still low rank (confined to the union of a few low rank subspaces). In all of these scenarios the low rank is unknown in general. 3 Feature Tracking Notation: A feature at a location z1 ∈R2 in a given N1 × N2 frame of an N1 × N2 × N3 video is characterized by a template T, which is an n × n sub-image of that frame centered at z1 (n is a small integer, generally taken to be odd, so the template has a center pixel). If z1 does not have integer coordinates, T is interpolated from the image. We denote Ω= 1, ..., n × 1, ..., n and we parametrize T so that its pixel values are obtained by T(u)u∈Ω. A classical formulation of the single-feature tracking problem is to search for the translation x1 that minimizes some distance between a feature’s template T at a given frame and the next frame of video translated by x1; we denote this next frame by I. That is, we minimize the single-feature energy function c(x1): c(x1) = 1 2 X u∈Ω ψ(T(u) −I(u + x1)) where, for example, ψ(x) = |x| or ψ(x) = x2. To apply continuous optimization we view x1 as a continuous variable and we thus view T and I as functions over continuous domains (implemented with bi-linear interpolation). 3.1 Low Rank Regularization Framework If we want to encourage a low rank structure in the trajectories, we cannot view the tracking of different features as separate problems. For f ∈1, 2, ..., F, let xf denote the position of feature f in the current frame (in image coordinates), and let x = (x1, x2, ..., xF ) ∈R2F denote the joint state of all features in the scene. We define the total energy function as follows: C(x) = 1 Fn2 F X f=1 X u∈Ω ψ(Tf(u) −I(u + xf)) where Tf(u) is the template for feature f. Now, we can impose desired relationships between features in a scene by imposing constraints on the domain of optimization. Instead of enforcing a hard constraint, we add a penalty term to, which increases the cost of states which are inconsistent with low-rank motion. Specifically, we define: C(x) = α F X f=1 X u∈Ω ψ(Tf(u) −I(u + xf)) + P(x) where P(x) is an estimate of, or proxy for, the dimensionality of the set of feature trajectories over the last several frames of video (past feature locations are treated as constants, so this is a function only of the current state, x). Notice that we have replaced the scale factor 1/(Fn2) from with the constant α, as this coefficient is now also responsible for controlling the relative strength of the penalty term. We will give explicit examples for P in section 3.2. This framework gives rise to two different solutions, characterized by the strength of the penalty term (definition of α). Each has useful, real-world tracking applications. In the first case, we assume 2 that most (but not necessarily all) features in the scene approximately obey a low rank model. This is appropriate if the scene contains non-rigid or multiple moving bodies. We can impose a weak constraint by making the penalty term small relative to the other terms. If a feature is strong, it will confidently track the imagery, ignoring the constraint (regardless of whether the motion is consistent with the other features in the scene). If a feature is weak in the sense that we cannot fully determine its true location by only looking at the imagery, then the penalty term will become significant and encourage the feature to agree with the motion of the other features in the scene. In the second case, we assume that all features in the scene are supposed to agree with a low rank model (and deviations from that model are indicative of tracking errors). We can impose a strong constraint by making the penalty term large relative to the other terms. No small set of features can overpower the constraint, regardless of how strong the features are. This forces all features to move is a way that is consistent with a simple motion. Thus, a small number of features can even be occluded, and their positions will be predicted by the motion of the other features in the scene. 3.2 Specific Choices of the Low-Rank Regularizer There is now a large body of work on low rank regularization. We will restrict ourselves to showing results using three choices for P described below. Each choice we present defines P(x) in terms of a matrix M. It is the 2(L + 1) × F matrix whose column f contains the feature trajectory for feature f within a sliding window of L + 1 consecutive frames (current frame and L past frames). Specifically, M = [mi,j], where (m0,f , m1,f)T is the current (variable) position of feature f and (m2l+1,f , m2l+2,f)T , l = 1, ..., L contains the x and y pixel coordinates of feature f from l frames in the past (past feature locations are treated as known constants). One may alternatively center the columns of M by subtracting from each column the average of all columns. Most constraints derived for trajectories actually confine trajectories to a low rank affine subspace (as opposed to a linear subspace). Centering the columns of M transforms an affine constraint into a linear one. Alternatively, one can forgo centering and view an affine constraint as a linear constraint in one dimension higher. We report results for both approaches. 3.2.1 Explicit Factorizations A simple method for enforcing the structure constraint is to write M = BC, where B is a 2(L+1)×d matrix, and C is a d × F matrix. However, as mentioned in the previous section, because the feature tracks often do not lie exactly on a subspace due to deviations from the camera model or non- rigidity, an explicit constraint of this form is not suitable. However, an explicit factorization can be used in a penalty term by measuring the deviation of M, in some norm, from its approximate low rank factorization. For example, if we let M = UΣV T denote the SVD of M, we can take P(x) to be ||BC M||, where B is the first three or four columns of U, and C is the first three or four rows of V T . Then this P corresponds to penalizing M via PF i=d+1 σi, where σi = λii is the ith singular value of M. As above, since the history is fixed, U, Σ, and V T are functions of x. This approach assumes knowledge of the low-rank d. For simplicity, we assume a local rigid model and thus set d = 3 when centering M and d = 4 when not centering. 3.2.2 Nuclear Norm A popular alternative to explicitly keeping track of the best fit low-dimensional subspace to M is to use the matrix nuclear norm and define P(x) = ||M||∗= ||σ||1 This is a convex proxy for the rank of M. Here σ = (σ1 σ2 . . . σ2(L+1)∧F )T is the vector of singular values of M, and || · ||1 is the l1 norm. Unlike explicit factorization, where only energy outside the first d principal components of M is punished, the nuclear norm will favor lower-rank M over higher-rank M even when both matrices have rank d. Thus, using this kind of penalty will favor simpler track point motions over more complex ones, even when both are technically permissible. 3 3.2.3 Empirical Dimension Empirical Dimension refers to a class of dimension estimators depending on a parameter ϵ ∈(0,1]. The empirical dimension of M is defined to be: dϵ(M) = ||σ||ϵ 1 ||σ||ϵϵ Notice that we use norm notation, although || · ||ϵ is only a pseudo-norm. When ϵ = 1, this is sometimes called the “effective rank” of the data matrix. Empirical dimension satisfies a few important properties. First, empirical dimension is invariant under rotation and scaling of a data set. Additionally, in the absence of noise, empirical dimension never exceeds true dimension, but it approaches true dimension as the number of measurements goes to infinity for spherically symmetric distributions. Thus, dϵ is a true dimension estimator (whereas the nuclear norm is a proxy for dimension). To use empirical dimension as our regularizer, we define P(x) = dϵ(M). Empirical dimension is governed by its parameter, ϵ. An ϵ near 0 results in a “strict” estimator, which is appropriate for estimating dimension in situations where you have little noise and you expect your data to live in true linear spaces. If ϵ is near 1 then dϵ is a lenient estimator. This makes it less sensitive to noise, and more tolerant of data sets that are only approximately linear. In all of the experiments we present, we use ϵ = 0.6, although we found that other tested values also worked well. 3.3 Implementation Details We fix L = 10 for the sliding window and let (x) = |x|. We use this form for so that all terms in the total energy function behave linearly in a known range of values. If our fit terms behaved quadratically, it would be more challenging to balance them against a penalty term. We also tested a Huber loss function for and have concluded that such a regularization is not needed. We fix a parameter m for each penalty form (selected empirically - see the supplementary material for our procedure), which determines the strength of the penalty. The weak and strong regularization parameters are set as follows: αweak = 1 mn2 and αstrong = 1 mFn2 The weak scaling implies that a perfectly-matched feature will contribute 0 to the total energy, and a poorly-matched feature will contribute an amount on the order of 1/m to the total energy. The penalty term will contribute on the order of 1 to the total energy. Since we do not divide the contributions of each feature by the number of features, the penalty terms contribution is comparable in magnitude to that of a single feature. The strong scaling implies that the penalty term is on the same scale as the sum of the contributions of all of the features in the scene. 3.3.1 Minimization Strategy The total energy function we propose for constrained tracking is non-convex since the contributions from the template fit terms are not convex (even if P is convex); this is also the case with other feature tracking methods, including the Lucas-Kanade tracker. We employ a 1st-order descent approach for driving the energy to a local minimum. To reduce the computational load of feature tracking, some trackers use 2nd-order methods for optimization. This works well when tracking strong features, but in our experience it can be unreliable when dealing with weak or ambiguous features. Since we are explicitly trying to improve tracking accuracy on poor features we opt for a 1st-order descent approach instead. The simplest 1st-order descent method is (sub)gradient descent. Unfortunately, because there can be a very large difference in magnitude between the contributions of strong and weak features to our total energy, our problem is not well-conditioned. If we pursue standard gradient descent, the strong features dictate the step direction and the weak features have very little effect on it. Ideally, once the strong features are correctly positioned, they will no longer dominate the step direction. If we were able to perfectly measure the gradient of our objective function, this would be the case. In practice, the error in our numerical gradient estimate can be large enough to prevent the strong features from 4 ever relinquishing control over the step direction. The result is that in a scene with both very strong and very weak features, the weak features may not be tracked. To remedy this, we compute our step direction by blending the gradient of the energy function with a vector that corresponds to taking equal-sized gradient descent steps separately for each feature. We use a fast line search in each iteration to find the nearest local minimum in the step direction. This compromise approach allows for efficient descent while ensuring that each feature has some control over the step direction (regardless of feature strength). Because the energy is not convex, it is important to choose a good initial state. We use a combination of two strategies to initialize the tracking: first, we generate our initial guess of x by registering an entire frame of video with the previous (at lower resolution). Secondly, we use multi-resolution, or pyramidal tracking so that approximate motion on a large scale can help us get close to the minimum before we try tracking on finer resolution levels. We now explain the details of the algorithm. Let I denote a full new frame of video and let xprev be the concatenation of feature positions in the previous frame. We form a pyramid for I where level 0 is the full-resolution image and each higher level m (1 through 3) has half the vertical and half the horizontal resolution of level m 1. To initialize the optimization, we take the full frame (at resolution level 3) and register it against the previous frame (also at resolution level 3) using gradient descent and an absolute value loss function. We initialize each features position in the current frame by taking its position in the previous frame and adding the offset between the frames, as found through this registration process). Once we have our initial x, we begin optimization on the top pyramid level. When done on the top level, we use the result to initialize optimization on the level below it, and so on until we have found a local minimum on level 0. On any given pyramid level, we perform optimization by iteratively computing a step direction and conducting a fast line search to find a local minimum in the search direction. We impose a minimum and maximum on the number of steps to be performed on each level (mini and maxi, respectively). Our termination condition (on a given level) is when the magnitude of the derivative of C is not significantly smaller than it was in the previous step. To compute our search direction in each step, we first compute the gradient of C (which we will call DC) and set a = This is done by breaking it into a collection of 2-vectors (elements 1 and 2 are together, elements 3 and 4 are together, and so on) and normalizing each of them. We then recombine the normalized 2-vectors to get b. We blend a with c to compute our step direction. Algorithm 1 summarizes the full process. 3.3.2 Efficiency and Complexity We have found that our algorithm typically converges in about 20 iterations or less at each pyramid level (with fewer iterations on lower pyramid levels). In our experiments, we used a resolution of 640-by-480 (we have also done tests at 1000 × 562), and we found that 4 pyramid levels were sufficient for reliable tracking. Thus, on average, less than 80 iterations are required to track from one frame to the next. A single iteration requires one gradient evaluation and multiple evaluations of C. The complexity of a gradient evaluation is k1Fn2 + k2LF 2, and the complexity of an energy evaluation is k3Fn2 + k4L2F. Our C++ implementation (which makes use of OpenCV) can run on 35 features of size 7-by-7 with a temporal window of 6 frames (L = 5) on a 3rd-generation Intel i5 CPU at approximately 16 frames per second. SIMD instructions are used in places, but no multi-threading was used, so faster processing rates are possible. With a larger window of L = 10 our algorithm still runs at 2-5 frames per second. 4 Experiments To evaluate our method, we conducted tests on several real video sequences in circumstances that are difficult for feature tracking. These included shaky footage in low-light environments. The resulting videos contained dark regions with few good features and the unsteady camera motion and poor lighting introduced time-varying motion blur. In these video sequences it proved very difficult to hand-register features for ground-truth. In order to present a quantitative numerical comparison we also collected higher-quality video sequences and synthetically degraded their quality. We used a standard Lucas-Kanade tracker on the non-degraded 5 videos to generate ground-truth (the output was human-verified and corrected). We therefore present qualitative results on real, low-quality video sequences, as well as quantitative results on a set of synthetically degraded videos. 4.1 Qualitative Experiments on Real Videos In our tests on real video sequences containing low- quality features, single-feature tracking does not provide acceptable results. When following a non-distinctive feature, the single-feature energy function often flattens out in one or more directions. A tracker may move in any ambiguous direction without realizing a better or worse match with the features template. This results in the tracked location drifting away from a features true location (i.e. “wandering”). This is not a technical limitation of one particular tracking implementation. Rather, it is a fundamental problem due to the fact that the local imagery in a small neighborhood of a feature does not always contain enough information to deduce the features motion between frames. This claim can be verified by attempting 6",1,,,,
P088.pdf,"Analyzing Groups of Neurons in Neural Networks: Comparing Information from Input and Output Perspectives Abstract The concept of a ""modular"" structure in artificial neural networks has been suggested as beneficial for learning, the ability to combine elements, and applying knowledge to new situations. However, a clear definition and measurement of modularity are still open questions. This paper reframes the identification of functional modules as the identification of groups of units with similar functions. This raises the question of what constitutes functional similarity between two units. To address this, we examine two main categories of methods: those that define similarity based on how units react to variations in inputs (upstream), and those that define similarity based on how changes in hidden unit activations affect outputs (downstream). We perform an empirical analysis to measure the modularity of hidden layer representations in simple feedforward, fully connected networks across various settings. For each model, we assess the relationships between pairs of hidden units in each layer using a range of upstream and downstream metrics, then group them by maximizing their ""modularity score"" with established network science tools. We find two unexpected results: first, dropout significantly increased modularity, while other forms of weight regularization had smaller effects. Second, while we observe general agreement on clusters within upstream methods and within downstream methods, there is limited agreement on cluster assignments between these two categories. This has significant implications for representation learning, as it implies that finding modular representations that reflect input structure (e.g., disentanglement) may be a different objective from learning modular representations that reflect output structure (e.g., compositionality). 1 Introduction Modularity, a principle where complex systems are broken down into simpler subsystems, allows for independent analysis, debugging, and recombination for new tasks. This design approach offers benefits like enhanced robustness and quicker adaptation to new challenges. It is recognized that learning systems gain advantages from structures tailored to the specific problem, and many real-world problems can indeed be divided into sub-problems. Consequently, modularity is viewed as a standard design principle in evolved biological systems, including biological neural networks, and one that can be advantageous for artificial neural networks (ANNs). Despite the intuitive appeal, formally defining and quantifying the modularity of a given system remains an unresolved issue. It is generally agreed that modular systems, by definition, break down into subsystems that carry out functions to solve sub-problems. Defining modules in ANNs, therefore, requires us to determine when two parts of a network are involved in the same ""function"". In this paper, we address this question at the level of pairs of hidden units. We explore various methods for assessing the ""functional similarity"" of any two hidden units, and we define a ""module"" as a group of units with similar functions. This definition is not intended to be the definitive answer to what constitutes a module, but rather to offer a practical foundation for experimenting with different concepts related to modularity, such as how regularization affects it. A key objective of this paper is to highlight the differences between ""upstream"" and ""downstream"" perspectives when considering neural representations and their functions. In Section 3, we provide precise definitions and detail our method for identifying and quantifying functional modules in the hidden layers of trained neural networks by grouping units into functionally similar sets. This framework enables us to directly compare various indicators of a network’s modularity. Section 4 describes the experimental results. Besides quantitatively evaluating modularity, we further examine whether different similarity measures agree on the assignment of units to modules. Surprisingly, we find that modules identified using ""upstream"" measures of functional similarity are consistently different from those found using ""downstream"" measures. Although we do not examine regularization methods specifically designed to create modular designs, these initial findings call for a more in-depth examination of how the ""function"" of a representation is defined, as well as why and when modules might be beneficial. 2 Related Work The investigation of modularity in neural networks has a rich history. A frequent source of inspiration from biology is the separation of ""what"" and ""where"" pathways in the ventral and dorsal streams of the brain, respectively. Each pathway can be viewed as a specialized module (and can be further divided into submodules). Numerous prior experiments on modularity in artificial neural networks have investigated principles that would lead to similarly distinct what/where information processing in ANNs. A significant distinction from this line of work is that, instead of predefining the functional role of modules, such as one module handling ""what"" and another handling ""where,"" our research aims to discover distinct functional groups in trained networks. Generally, there are two categories of approaches to modularity in neural networks, each corresponding to a different way of understanding the function of network components. The structural modularity approach defines function based on network weights and the connections between sub-networks. Modules are thus defined as sub-networks with dense internal connections and sparse external connections. The functional modularity approach focuses on network activations or the information represented by those activations, rather than weights. This includes concepts like disentanglement, compositionality, and invariance. The connection between structural and functional modules is not entirely clear. While they seem to be (or should be) correlated, it has been observed that even very sparse inter-module connectivity does not always ensure functional separation of information processing. In this study, we adopt the functional approach, assuming that structural modularity is only useful to the extent that it supports distinct functions of the units, and that often distinct functions must share information, making strict structural boundaries potentially detrimental. For instance, in a complex visual scene, knowing ""what"" an object is can aid in determining ""where"" it is, and vice versa. Our work is most closely related to a series of papers by Watanabe and colleagues in which trained networks are decomposed into clusters of ""similar"" units with the aim of understanding and simplifying those networks. They quantify the similarity of units using a combination of both incoming and outgoing weights. This is similar in spirit to our goal of identifying modules by clustering units, but an interesting contrast to our approach, where we find stark differences between ""upstream"" and ""downstream"" similarity. 3 Quantifying modularity by clustering similarity We divide the task of identifying functional modules into two phases: evaluating the pairwise similarity of units, and then clustering based on this similarity. For simplicity, we apply these steps separately to each hidden layer, although in principle, modules could be assessed in the same way after combining layers. Section 3.1 defines the set of pairwise functional similarity methods we use, and Section 3.2 describes the clustering phase. While we concentrate on similarity between pairs of individual units, our method is connected to, and inspired by, the question of what makes neural representations ""similar"" when comparing entire populations of neurons to each other. Instead of finding clusters of similar neurons as we do here, one could define modules in terms of dissimilarity between clusters of neurons. In preliminary work, we explored such a definition of functional modules, using representational (dis)similarity between sub-populations of neurons. The primary challenge with this approach is that existing representational similarity methods are highly sensitive to dimensionality (the number of neurons in each cluster), and it is not clear how best to account for this when calculating dissimilarity between clusters so that the method is not biased towards larger or smaller cluster sizes. To further justify our method, note that representational similarity analysis is closely related to tests for statistical (in)dependence between populations of neurons, and so the problem of finding mutually ""dissimilar"" modules is analogous to the problem of finding independent subspaces. In Independent Subspace Analysis (ISA), there is a similar issue of determining what constitutes a surprising amount of dependence between subspaces of different dimensions, and various methods have been proposed with different inductive biases. However, Palmer Makeig showed that a solution to the problem of detecting independent subspaces is to simply cluster the individual dimensions of the space. This provides some justification for the methods we use here: some technicalities notwithstanding, the problem of finding subspaces of neural activity with ""dissimilar"" representations is, in many cases, reducible to the problem of clustering individual units based on pairwise similarity, as we do here. 3.1 Quantifying pairwise similarity of hidden units What constitutes ""functional similarity"" between two hidden units? In other words, we are looking for a similarity function S that takes a neural network N, a dataset D, and a task T as inputs, and produces an n x n matrix of non-negative similarity scores for all pairs among the n hidden units. We also require that the resulting matrix is symmetric, meaning Sij = Sji. Importantly, allowing S to depend on the task T opens up the possibility of similarity measures where units are considered similar based on their downstream contribution to a specific loss function. Similarity by covariance. The first similarity measure we examine is the absolute value of the covariance of hidden unit activities across inputs. Let xk be the kth input in the dataset, and hi(x) be the response of the ith hidden unit to input x, with i in 1, 2, ..., n. Then, we define similarity as Scov ij = 1 K K X k=1 |(hi(xk) −¯hi)(hj(xk) −¯hj)| (1) 2 where K is the number of items in D and ¯hi is the mean response of unit i on the given dataset. Intuitively, the absolute value covariance quantifies the statistical dependence of two units across inputs, making it an upstream measure of similarity. Similarity by input sensitivity. While Scov measures similarity of responses across inputs, we next consider a measure of similar sensitivity to single inputs, which is then averaged over D. Let Jh xk denote the n x d Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives of each hidden unit with respect to each of the d input dimensions. Then, we say two units i and j are similarly sensitive to input changes on input xk if the dot product between the ith and jth row of Jh xk has high absolute-value magnitude. In matrix notation over the entire dataset, we use Si−sens ij = 1 K K X k=1 |Jh xk(Jh xk)T | (2) where the superscript ""i-sens"" should be read as the ""input sensitivity."" Similarity by last-layer sensitivity. Let y denote the last-layer activity of the network. Using the same Jacobian notation as above, let Jy h denote the o x n matrix of partial derivatives of the last layer with respect to changes in the hidden activities h. Then, we define similarity by output sensitivity as So−sens ij = 1 K K X k=1 |Jy h(Jy h)T | (3) likewise with ""o-sens"" to be read as ""output-sensitivity."" Note that both h and y depend on the particular input xk, but this has been left implicit in the notation to reduce clutter. Similarity by the loss Hessian. The ""function"" of a hidden unit might usefully be thought of in terms of its contribution to the task or tasks it was trained on. To quote Lipson, ""In order to measure modularity, one must have a quantitative definition of function... It is then possible to take an arbitrary chunk of a system and measure the dependency of the system function on elements within that chunk. The more that the dependency itself depends on elements outside the chunk, the less the function of that chunk is localized, and hence the less modular it is."" Lipson then goes on to suggest that the ""dependence of system function on elements"" can be expressed as a derivative or gradient, and that the dependence of that dependence on other parts of the system can be expressed as the second derivative or Hessian. Towards this conception of modular functions on a particular task, we use the following definition of similarity: Shess ij = 1 K K X k=1 | ∂2L ∂hi∂hj | (4) where L is the scalar loss function for the task, and should be understood to depend on the particular input xk. Importantly, each Hessian on the right hand side is taken with respect to the activity of hidden units, not with respect to the network parameters as it is typically defined. To summarize, equations (1) through (4) provide four different methods to quantify pairwise similarity of hidden units. Scov and Si−sens are upstream, while So−sens and Shess are downstream. All four take values in [0, ). However, it is not clear if the raw magnitudes matter, or only relative (normalized) magnitudes. For these reasons, we introduce an optional normalized version of each of the above four un-normalized similarity measures: S′ ij = Sij max(Sii, Sjj, ϵ) (5) where ˘20ac is a small positive value included for numerical stability. Whereas Sij is in [0, ), the normalized values are restricted to S′ ij in [0,1]. In total, this gives us eight methods to quantify pairwise similarity. These can be thought of as 2x2x2 product of methods, as shown in the color scheme in Figure 2: the upstream vs downstream axis, the unnormalized vs normalized axis, and the covariance vs gradient (i.e. sensitivity) axis. We group together both Scov and Shess under the term ""covariance"" because the Hessian is closely related to the covariance of gradient vectors of the loss across inputs. 3.2 Quantifying modularity by clustering Decomposing a set into clusters that are maximally similar within clusters and maximally dissimilar across clusters is a well-studied problem in graph theory and network science. In particular, Girvan Newman proposed a method that cuts a graph into its maximally modular subgraphs, and this tool has previously been used to study modular neural networks. 3 We apply this tool from graph theory to our problem of detecting functional modules in neural networks by constructing an adjacency matrix A from the similarity matrix S by simply removing the diagonal (self-similarity): Aij = Sij if i ̸= j 0 otherwise (6) Given A, we can simplify later notation by first constructing the normalized adjacency matrix, ˜A, whose elements all sum to one: ˜Aij = Aij P ij Aij (7) or, more compactly, ˜A = A/1T nA1n where 1n is a column vector of length n containing all ones. Let P be an n x c matrix that represents cluster assignments for each of n units to a maximum of c different clusters. Cluster assignments can be ""hard"" (Pij in 0, 1) or ""soft"" (Pij in [0, 1]), but in either case the constraint P1c = 1n must be met, i.e. that the sum of cluster assignments for each unit is 1. If an entire column of P is zero, that cluster is unused, so c only provides an upper-limit to the number of clusters, and in practice we set c = n. Girvan Newman propose the following score to quantify the level of ""modularity"" when partitioning the normalized adjacency matrix ˜A into the cluster assignments P: Q( ˜A, P) = Tr(P T ˜AP) −Tr(P T ˜A1n1T n ˜AP) (8) The first term sums the total connectivity (or, in our case, similarity) of units that share a cluster. By itself, this term is maximized when P assigns all units to a single cluster. The second term gives the expected connectivity within each cluster under a null model where the elements of ˜A are interpreted as the joint probability of a connection, and so ˜A1n1T n ˜A is the product of marginal probabilities of each unit’s connections. This second term encourages P to place units into the same cluster only if they are more similar to each other than ""chance."" Together, equation (8) is maximized by partitioning ˜A into clusters that are strongly intra-connected and weakly inter-connected. We define the modularity of a set of neural network units as the maximum achievable Q over all P: P ∗( ˜A) = argmaxP Q( ˜A, P)Q∗( ˜A) = Q( ˜A, P ∗) (9) To summarize, to divide a given pairwise similarity matrix S into modules, we first construct ˜A from S, then we find the cluster assignments P ∗that give the maximal value Q∗. Importantly, this optimization process provides two pieces of information: a modularity score Q∗which quantifies the amount of modularity in a set of neurons, for a given similarity measure. We also get the actual cluster assignments P ∗, which provide additional information and can be compared across different similarity measures. Given a set of cluster assignments P ∗, we quantify the number of clusters by first getting the fraction of units in each cluster, r(P ∗) = 1T nP ∗/n. We then use the formula for discrete entropy to measure the dispersion of cluster sizes: H(r) = −Pc i=1 rilogri. Finally we say that the number of clusters in P ∗is numclusters(P ∗) = eH(r(P ∗)) (10) We emphasize that discovering the number of clusters in P ∗is included automatically in the optimization process; we set the maximum number of clusters c equal to the number of hidden units n, but in our experiments we find that P ∗rarely uses more than 6 clusters for hidden layers with 64 units (Supplemental Figure S4). It is important to recognize that the sense of the word ""modularity"" in graph theory is in some important ways distinct from its meaning in terms of engineering functionally modular systems. In graph-theoretic terms, a ""module"" is a cluster of nodes that are highly intra-connected and weakly inter-connected to other parts of the network, defined formally by Q. This definition of graph modularity uses a particular idea of a ""null model"" based on random connectivity between nodes in a graph. While this null-model of graph connectivity enjoys a good deal of historical precedence in the theory of randomly-connected graphs, where unweighted graphs are commonly studied in terms of the probability of connection between random pairs of nodes, it is not obvious that the same sort of null model applies to groups of ""functionally similar"" units in an ANN. This relates to the earlier discussion of ISA, and provides a possibly unsatisfying answer to the question of what counts as a ""surprising"" amount of statistical independence between clusters; using Q makes the implicit choice that the product of average pairwise similarity, ˜A1n1T n ˜A, gives the ""expected"" similarity between units. An important problem for future work will be to closely reexamine the question of what makes neural populations functionally similar or dissimilar, above and beyond statistical similarity, and what constitutes a surprising amount of (dis)similarity that may be indicative of modular design. Finding P ∗exactly is NP-complete, so in practice we use a variation on the approximate method proposed by Newman. Briefly, the approximation works in two steps: first, an initial set of cluster assignments is constructed using a fast spectral initialization method that, similar to other spectral clustering algorithms, recursively divides units into clusters based on the sign of eigenvectors of the 4 matrix B = ˜A −˜A1n1T n ˜A and its submatrices. Only subdivisions that increase Q are kept. In the second step, we use a Monte Carlo method that repeatedly selects a random unit i then resamples its cluster assignment, holding the other n-1 assignments fixed. This resampling step involves a kind of exploration/exploitation trade-off: Q may decrease slightly on each move to potentially find a better global optimum. We found that it was beneficial to control the entropy of each step using a temperature parameter, to ensure that a good explore/exploit balance was struck for all ˜A. Supplemental Figure S2 shows that both the initialization and the Monte Carlo steps play a crucial role in finding P ∗, consistent with the observations of Newman. Full algorithms are given in Appendix A.1. 4 Experiments 4.1 Setup and initial hypotheses Because our primary goal is to understand the behavior of the various notions of modularity above, i.e. based on the eight different methods for quantifying pairwise similarity introduced in the previous section, we opted to study a large collection of simple networks trained on MNIST. All pairwise similarity scores were computed using held-out test data. We trained 270 models, comprising 9 runs of each of 30 regularization settings, summarized in Table 1. We defined x (input layer) as the raw 784-dimensional pixel inputs and y (output layer) as the 10-dimensional class logits. We used the same basic feedforward architecture for all models, comprising two layers of hidden activity connected by three layers of fully-connected weights: Linear(784, 64), ReLU, dropout(p), Linear(64, 64), ReLU, dropout(p), Linear(64, 10). We analyzed modularity in the two 64-dimensional hidden layers following the dropout operations. We discarded 21 models that achieved less than 80 Before running these experiments, we hypothesized that 1. Dropout would decrease modularity by encouraging functions to be ""spread out"" over many units. 2. L2 regularization (weight decay) would minimally impact modularity since the L2 norm is invariant to rotation while modularity depends on axis-alignment. 3. L1 regularization on weights would increase modularity by encouraging sparsity between subnetworks. 4. All similarity measures would be qualitatively consistent with each other. As shown below, all four of these hypotheses turned out to be wrong, to varying degrees. 4.2 How modularity depends on regularization Figure 3 shows the dependence of trained networks’ modularity score (Q∗) as a function of regularization strength for each of three types of regularization: an L2 penalty on the weights (weight decay), an L1 penalty on the weights, and dropout. The top row of Figure 3 shows four example ˜A matrices sorted by cluster, to help give an intuition behind the quantitative values of Q∗. In these examples, the increasing value of Q∗is driven by an increasing contrast between intra-cluster similarity and inter-cluster similarity. In this example, it also appears that the number and size of clusters remains roughly constant; this observation is confirmed by plotting the number of clusters versus regularization strength in Supplemental Figure S4. Figure 3 shows a number of surprising patterns that contradict our initial predictions. First, and most saliently, we had predicted that dropout would reduce modularity, but found instead that it has the greatest effect on Q∗among the three regularization methods we tried. This is especially apparent in the upstream methods (first two columns of the figure), and is also stronger for the first hidden layer than the second (Supplemental Figure S3). In general, Q∗can increase either if the network partitions into a greater number of clusters, or if the contrast between clusters is exaggerated. We found that this dramatic effect of dropout on Q∗was accompanied by only minor changes to the number of clusters (Supplemental Figure S4), and so we can conclude that dropout increases Q∗by increasing the redundancy of hidden units. In other words, hidden units become more clusterable because they are driven towards behaving like functional replicas of each other, separately for each cluster. This observation echoes, and may explain, why dropout also increases the ""clusterability"" of network weights in a separate study. The second surprising result in Figure 3 is that L2 regularization on the weights did, in fact, increase Q∗, whereas we had expected it to have no impact. Third, L1 regularization had a surprisingly weak effect, although its similarity to the L2 regularization results may be explained by the fact that they actually resulted in fairly commensurate sparsity in the trained weights (Supplemental Figure S1 bottom row). Fourth, we had expected few differences between the eight different methods for computing similarity, but there appear to be distinctive trends by similarity type both in Figure S3 as well as in the number of clusters detected (Supplemental Figure S4). The next section explores the question of similarity in the results in more detail. 4.3 Comparing modules discovered by different similarity methods The previous section discussed idiosyncratic trends in the modularity scores Q∗as a function of both regularization strength and how pairwise similarity between units (S) is computed. However, such differences in the quantitative value of Q∗are difficult to interpret, and would largely be moot if the various methods agreed on the question of which units belong in which cluster. We now turn to the question of how similar the cluster assignments P ∗are across our eight definitions of functional modules. To minimize ambiguity, we will use the term ""functional-similarity"" to refer to S, and ""cluster-similarity"" to refer to the comparison of different cluster assignments P ∗. 5 Quantifying similarity between cluster assignments is a well-studied problem, and we tested a variety of methods in the clusim Python package. All cluster-similarity methods we investigated gave qualitatively similar results, so here we report only the ""Element Similarity"" method of Gates et al., which is a value between 0 and 1 that is small when two cluster assignments are unrelated, and large when one cluster assignment is highly predictive of the other. Note that this cluster-similarity analysis is applied only to P ∗ cluster assignments computed in the same layer of the same model. Thus, any dissimilarity in clusters that we see is due entirely to the different choices for functional-similarity, S. Figure 4a summarizes the results of this cluster-similarity analysis: there is a striking difference between clusters of units identified by ""upstream"" functional-similarity methods (Scov, ˜Scov, Si−sens, ˜Si−sens) compared to ""downstream"" functional-similarity methods (Shess, ˜Shess, So−sens, ˜So−sens). This analysis also reveals secondary structure within each class of upstream and downstream methods, where the choice to normalize not (S vs ˜S) appears to matter little, and where there is a moderate difference between moment-based methods (Scov, Shess) and gradient-based methods (Si−sens, So−sens). It is worth noting that some of this secondary structure is not robust across all types and levels of regularization; in particular, increasing L2 or L1 regularization strength appears to lead to (i) stronger dependence on normalization in the downstream methods, and (ii) a stronger overall agreement among the upstream methods (Supplemental Figure S5). We next asked to what extent these cluster-similarity results are driven by training. As shown in Figure 4b, much of the structure in the downstream methods is unaffected by training (i.e. it is present in untrained models as well), while the cluster-similarity among different upstream methods only emerged as a result of training. Interestingly, this analysis further shows that the main upstream-vs-downstream distinction seen in Figure 4a is, in fact, attenuated slightly by training. 5 Conclusions The prevalence of ""modular"" designs in both engineered and evolved systems has led many to consider the benefits of modularity as a design principle, and how learning agents like artificial neural networks might discover such designs. However, precisely defining what constitutes a ""module"" within a neural network remains an open problem. In this work, we operationalized modules in a neural network as groups of hidden units that carry out similar functions. This naturally leads to the question of what makes any two units functionally similar. We introduced eight functional similarity measures designed to capture various intuitions about unit similarity and empirically evaluated cluster assignments based on each method in a large number of trained models. One unexpected observation was that dropout increases modularity (as defined by Q∗), although this has little to do with the common-sense definition of a ""module."" Instead, it is a byproduct of dropout causing subsets of units to behave like near-copies of each other, perhaps so that if one unit is dropped out, a copy of it provides similar information to the subsequent layer. To our knowledge, this redundancy-inducing effect of dropout has not been noted in the literature previously. Our main result is that there is a crucial difference between defining ""function"" in terms of how units are driven by upstream inputs, and how units drive downstream outputs. While we studied this distinction between upstream and downstream similarity in the context of modularity and clustering, it speaks to the deeper and more general problem of how best to interpret neural representations. For example, some sub-disciplines of representation-learning (e.g. ""disentanglement"") have long emphasized that a ""good"" neural representation is one where distinct features of the world drive distinct sub-populations or sub-spaces of neural activity. This is an upstream way of thinking about what is represented, since it depends only on the relationship between inputs and the unit activations and does not take into account what happens downstream. Meanwhile, many have argued that the defining characteristic of a neural representation is its causal role in downstream behavior; this is, of course, a downstream way of thinking. At a high level, one way to interpret our results is is that upstream and downstream ways of thinking about neural representations are not necessarily aligned, even in trained networks. This observation is reminiscent of recent empirical work finding that ""disentangled"" representations in auto-encoders (an upstream concept) do not necessarily lead to improved performance or generalization to novel tasks (a downstream concept). Despite its theoretical motivations, this is an empirical study. We trained over 250 feedforward, fully-connected neural networks on MNIST. While it is not obvious whether MNIST admits a meaningful ""modular"" solution, we expect that the main results we show here are likely robust, in particular (i) the effect of weight decay, an L1 weight penalty, and dropout, and (ii) misalignment between upstream and downstream definitions of neural similarity. Our work raises the important questions: are neural representations defined by their inputs or their outputs? And, in what contexts is it beneficial for these to be aligned? We look forward to future work applying our methods to larger networks trained on more structured data, as well as recurrent networks. We also believe it will be valuable to evaluate the effect of attempting to maximize modularity, as we have defined it, during training, to see to what extent this is possible and whether it leads to performance benefits. Note that maximizing Q during training is challenging because (i) computing S may require large batches, and more importantly (ii) optimizing Q is highly prone to local minima, since neural activity and cluster assignments P will tend to reinforce each other, entrenching accidental clusters that appear at the beginning of training. We suspect that maintaining uncertainty over cluster assignments (e.g. using soft Pij in [0, 1] rather than hard P in 0, 1 cluster assignments) will be crucial if optimizing any of our proposed modularity metrics during training. 6 References Mohammed Amer and Tomás Maul.

P089.pdf,"Precise Requirements for the Validity of the Neural Tangent Kernel Approximation Abstract This research investigates the conditions under which the neural tangent kernel (NTK) approximation remains valid when employing the square loss function for model training. Within the framework of lazy training, as introduced by Chizat et al., we demonstrate that a model, rescaled by a factor of α = O(T), maintains the validity of the NTK approximation up to a training time of T. This finding refines the earlier result from Chizat et al., which necessitated a larger rescaling factor of α = O(T 2), and establishes the preciseness of our established bound. 1 Introduction In contemporary machine learning practice, the weights w of expansive neural network models fw : Rdin →Rdout are trained using gradient-based optimizers. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding remains elusive due to the non-linear nature of the training dynamics, which complicates analysis. To bridge this gap, an approximation to these dynamics, termed the NTK approximation, was introduced, and its validity for infinitely wide networks trained via gradient descent was demonstrated. The NTK approximation has proven highly influential, offering theoretical insights into various phenomena, including deep learning’s capacity to memorize training data, the manifestation of spectral bias in neural networks, and the differential generalization capabilities of diverse architectures. Nevertheless, empirical evidence suggests that the training dynamics of neural networks frequently deviate from the NTK approximation’s predictions. Consequently, it becomes crucial to delineate the precise conditions under which the NTK approximation remains applicable. This paper seeks to address the following inquiry: Is it possible to establish precise conditions that guarantee the validity of the NTK approximation? 1.1 The Lazy Training Framework The work demonstrated that the NTK approximation is applicable to the training of any differentiable model, provided the model’s outputs are rescaled appropriately. This rescaling ensures that significant changes in the model’s outputs can occur even with minor adjustments to the weights. The validity of the NTK approximation for models of infinite width stems from this observation, as the model is inherently rescaled as its width approaches infinity. Consider a smoothly parameterized model h : Rp →F, where F is a separable Hilbert space. Let α > 0 be a parameter governing the model’s rescaling, which should be considered large. We train the rescaled model αh using gradient flow to minimize a smooth loss function R : F →R+. The weights w(t) ∈Rp are initialized at w(0) = w0 and evolve according to the gradient flow: dw dt = −1 α2 ∇wR(αh(w(t))). (1) Define the linear approximation of the model around the initial weights w0 as: ¯h(w) = h(w0) + Dh(w0)(w −w0), (2) where Dh is the first derivative of h with respect to w. Let ¯w(t) be weights initialized at ¯w(0) = w0 that evolve according to the gradient flow from training the rescaled linearized model α¯h: d ¯w dt = −1 α2 ∇¯ wR(α¯h( ¯w(t))). (3) The NTK approximation asserts that: αh(w(t)) ≈α¯h( ¯w(t)). (4) In essence, this implies that the linearization of the model h remains valid throughout the training process. This greatly simplifies the analysis of training dynamics, as the model ¯h is linear in its parameters, allowing the evolution of ¯h( ¯w) to be understood through a kernel gradient flow in function space. The validity of the NTK approximation is contingent on the magnitude of the rescaling parameter α. Intuitively, a larger α implies that the weights need not deviate significantly from their initialization to induce substantial changes in the model’s output, thereby prolonging the validity of the linearization. This regime of training, where weights remain close to their initialization, is referred to as ""lazy training."" The following bound was established, where R0 = R(αh(w0))) is the loss at initialization, and κ = Tα−1Lip(Dh)√R0 is a quantity that will also feature in our main results: **Proposition 1.1.** Let R(y) = 1 2∥y −y∗∥2 2 be the square loss, where y∗∈F are the target labels. Assume that h is Lip(h)- Lipschitz and that Dh is Lip(Dh)-Lipschitz in a ball of radius ρ around w0. Then, for any time 0 ≤T ≤αρ/(Lip(h)√R0), ∥αh(w(T)) −α¯h( ¯w(T))∥≤TLip(h)2κR0. (5) As α approaches infinity, κ tends to 0, rendering the right-hand side of the inequality small and validating the NTK approximation. 1.2 Our Contributions Our primary contribution is the refinement of the bound for extended time scales. We establish the following theorem: **Theorem 1.2 (NTK Approximation Error Bound).** Let R(y) = 1 2∥y −y∗∥2 2 be the square loss. Assume that Dh is Lip(Dh)- Lipschitz in a ball of radius ρ around w0. Then, at any time 0 ≤T ≤α2ρ2/R0, ∥αh(w(T)) −α¯h( ¯w(T))∥≤min(6κ p R0, 8R0). (6) Furthermore, we demonstrate that this bound is tight up to a constant factor. **Theorem 1.3 (Converse to Theorem 1.2).** For any α, T, Lip(Dh), and R0, there exists a model h : R →R, a target y∗∈R, and an initialization w0 ∈R such that, for the risk R(y) = 1 2(y −y∗)2, the initial risk is R(αh(w0)) = R0, the derivative map Dh is Lip(Dh)-Lipschitz, and ∥αh(w(T)) −α¯h( ¯w(T))∥≥min 1 5κ p R0, 1 5R0  . (7) In contrast to prior work, our bound does not depend on the Lipschitz constant of h, and it exhibits a more favorable dependence on T. Specifically, if Lip(Dh), Lip(h), and R0 are bounded by constants, our result indicates that the NTK approximation, up to an error of O(ϵ), holds for times T = O(αϵ), whereas the previously known bound was valid for T = O(√αϵ). Given the practical interest in long training times T ≫1, our result demonstrates that the NTK approximation is valid for significantly longer time horizons than previously recognized. 2 Application to Neural Networks The bound established in Theorem 1.2 is applicable to the lazy training of any differentiable model. As a specific example, we detail its application to neural networks. We parameterize the networks in the mean-field regime, where the NTK approximation does not hold even as the width approaches infinity. Consequently, the NTK approximation is valid only when training is conducted in the lazy regime. Let fw : Rd →R be a 2-layer network of width m in the mean-field parametrization, with activation function σ : R →R, fw(x) = 1 √m m X i=1 aiσ(√m⟨x, ui⟩). (8) The weights are w = (a, U) for a = [a1, . . . , am] and U = [u1, . . . , um]. These are initialized at w0 with i.i.d. Unif[−1/√m, 1/√m] entries. Given training data (x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn), we train the weights of the network with the mean- squared loss L(w) = 1 n n X i=1 ℓ(fw(xi), yi), ℓ(a, b) = 1 2(a −b)2. (9) In the Hilbert space notation, we let H = Rn, so that the gradient flow training dynamics with loss (6) correspond to the gradient flow dynamics (1) with the following model and loss function h(w) = 1 √n[fw(x1), . . . , fw(xn)] ∈Rn, R(v) = 1 2 v −y √n 2 2 . (10) Under certain regularity assumptions on the activation function (satisfied, for instance, by the sigmoid function) and a bound on the weights, it can be shown that Lip(Dh) is bounded. **Lemma 2.1 (Bound on Lip(Dh) for mean-field 2-layer network).** Suppose there exists a constant K such that (i) the activation function σ is bounded and has bounded derivatives ∥σ∥∞, ∥σ′∥∞, ∥σ′′∥∞, ∥σ′′′∥∞≤K, (ii) the weights have bounded norm ∥U∥a ≤K, and (iii) the data points have bounded norm ∥x∥≤K. Then there exists a constant K′ depending only on K such that Lip(Dh) ≤K′. (11) 2 Since the assumptions of Theorem 1.2 are met, we obtain the following corollary for the lazy training dynamics of the 2-layer mean-field network. **Corollary 2.2 (Lazy training of 2-layer mean-field network).** Suppose the conditions of Lemma 2.1 hold, and also that the labels are bounded in norm ∥y∥≤c. Then there exist constants C, c > 0 depending only on K such that for any time 0 ≤T ≤cα2, ∥αh(w(T)) −α¯h( ¯w(T))∥≤C min(T/α, 1). (12) Training in the NTK parametrization corresponds to training the model √mfw, where fw is the network in the mean-field parametrization. This is equivalent to setting the lazy training parameter α = √m in the mean-field setting. Therefore, under the NTK parametrization with width m, the bound in Corollary 2.2 indicates that the NTK approximation is valid until training time O(m) and the error bound is O(T/√m). 3 Proof Ideas 3.1 Proof Ideas for Theorem 1.2 To provide intuition for our proof, we first outline the approach used in the original proof. Define residuals r(t), ¯r(t) ∈F under training the original rescaled model αh(w(t)) and the linearized rescaled model α¯h( ¯w(t)) as r(t) = y∗−αh(w(t)) and ¯r(t) = y∗−α¯h( ¯w(t)). These evolve according to dr dt = −Ktr and d¯r dt = −K0¯r, (13) where Kt := Dh(w(t))Dh(w(t))∗is the time-dependent kernel. To compare these trajectories, it was observed that, since K0 is positive semidefinite, d dt∥r −¯r∥2 2 = −⟨r −¯r, Ktr −K0¯r⟩≤−⟨r −¯r, (Kt −K0)r⟩ (14) which, dividing both sides by ∥r −¯r∥and using ∥r∥≤√R0, implies d dt∥r −¯r∥≤∥Kt −K0∥∥r∥≤2Lip(h)Lip(Dh)∥w −w0∥ p R0. (15) Using the Lipschitzness of the model, it was further shown that the weight change is bounded by ∥w(t) −w0∥≤t√R0Lip(h)/α. Plugging this into (7) yields the bound in Proposition 1.1, ∥αh(w(T)) −α¯h( ¯w(T))∥= ∥r(T) −¯r(T)∥≤2Lip(h)2Lip(Dh)R0α−1 Z T 0 tdt = T 2Lip(h)2Lip(Dh)R0/α. (16) **First attempt: strengthening of the bound for long time horizons** We demonstrate how to strengthen this bound to hold for longer time horizons by employing an improved bound on the movement of the weights. Consider the following bound on the weight change. **Proposition 3.1 (Bound on weight change, implicit in proof of Theorem 2.2).** ∥w(T) −w0∥≤ p TR0/α and ∥¯w(T) −w0∥≤ p TR0/α. (17) **Proof of Proposition 3.1.** By (a) Cauchy-Schwarz, and (b) the nonnegativity of the loss R, ∥w(T) −w(0)∥≤ Z T 0 dw dt dt (a) ≤ s T Z T 0 dw dt 2 dt = s −T α2 Z T 0 d dtR(αh(w(t)))dt (b) ≤ p TR0/α. (18) The bound for ¯w is analogous. This bound (8) has the advantage of √ t dependence (instead of linear t dependence) and does not depend on Lip(h). Plugging it into (7), we obtain ∥αh(w(T)) −α¯h( ¯w(T))∥≤2Lip(h)Lip(Dh)R0α−1 Z T 0 √ tdt = 4 3T 3/2Lip(h)Lip(Dh)R0/α. (19) This improves over Proposition 1.1 for long time horizons, as the time dependence scales as T 3/2 instead of T 2. However, it still depends on the Lipschitz constant Lip(h) and falls short of the linear in T dependence of Theorem 1.2. **Second attempt: new approach to prove Theorem 1.2** To avoid dependence on Lip(h) and achieve a linear dependence in T, we develop a new approach. We cannot use (7), which was central to the original proof, as it depends on Lip(h). Furthermore, to achieve linear T dependence using (7), we would need ∥w −w0∥= O(1) for a constant independent of the time horizon, which is not true unless the problem is well-conditioned. 3 In the full proof in Appendix A, we bound ∥r(T) −¯r(T)∥, which requires working with a product integral formulation of the dynamics of r to handle the time-varying kernels Kt. The main technical innovation in the proof is Theorem A.8, which is a new, general bound on the difference between product integrals. To avoid the technical complications of the appendix, we provide some intuitions here by proving a simplified theorem that does not imply the main result. We show: **Theorem 3.2 (Simplified variant of Theorem 1.2).** Consider r′(t) ∈F initialized as r′(0) = r(0) and evolving as dr′ dt = −KT r′. Then, ∥r′(T) −¯r(T)∥≤min(3κ p R0, 8R0). (20) Intuitively, if we can prove in Theorem 3.2 that r′(T) and ¯r(T) are close, then the same should hold for r(T) and ¯r(T) as in Theorem 1.2. For convenience, define the operators A = Dh(w0)∗ and B = Dh(w(T))∗−Dh(w0)∗. (21) Since the kernels do not vary in time, the closed-form solution is r′(t) = e−(A+B)∗(A+B)tr(0) and ¯r(t) = e−A∗Atr(0) (22) We prove that the time evolution operators for r′ and ¯r are close in operator norm. **Lemma 3.3.** For any t ≥0, we have ∥e−(A+B)∗(A+B)t −e−A∗At∥≤2 √ t∥B∥. **Proof of Lemma 3.3.** Define Z(ζ) = (A + ζB)∗(A + ζB)t. By the fundamental theorem of calculus, ∥e−(A+B)∗(A+B)t −e−A∗At∥= ∥eZ(1) −eZ(0)∥= Z 1 0 d dζ eZ(ζ)dζ ≤sup ζ∈[0,1] d dζ eZ(ζ) . (23) Using the integral representation of the exponential map, d dζ eZ(ζ) = Z 1 0 e(1−τ)Z(ζ)  d dζ Z(ζ)  eτZ(ζ)dτ = Z 1 0 e(1−τ)Z(ζ)(A∗B + B∗A + 2ζB∗B)eτZ(ζ)dτ (24) By symmetry under transposing and reversing time, it suffices to bound the first term. Since ∥eτZ(ζ)∥≤1, Z 1 0 e(1−τ)Z(ζ)(A + ζB)∗BeτZ(ζ)tdτ ≤ Z 1 0 ∥e(1−τ)Z(ζ)(A + ζB)∗∥∥tB∥dτ ≤2t/e∥B∥≤2 √ t∥B∥ (25) Finally, let us combine Lemma 3.3 with the weight-change bound in Proposition 3.1 to prove Theorem 3.2. Notice that the weight-change bound in Proposition 3.1 implies ∥B∥≤Lip(Dh)∥w(T) −w0∥≤Lip(Dh) p TR0/α. (26) So Lemma 3.3 implies ∥r′(T) −¯r(T)∥≤2Lip(Dh)T p R0α−1∥r(0)∥= 2κ∥r(0)∥. (27) Combining this with ∥r′(T) −¯r(T)∥≤∥r′(T)∥+ ∥¯r(T)∥≤2√2R0 implies (9). Thus, we have shown Theorem 3.2, which is the result of Theorem 1.2 if we replace r by r′. The actual proof of the theorem handles the time-varying kernel Kt and is in Appendix A. 3.2 Proof Ideas for Theorem 1.3 The converse in Theorem 1.3 is achieved in the simple case where h(w) = aw + 1 2bw2 for a = 1/ √ T and b = Lip(Dh), and w0 = 0 and R(y) = 1 2(y −√2R0)2, as we show in Appendix B by direct calculation. 4 Discussion A limitation of our result is that it applies only to gradient flow, which corresponds to SGD with infinitesimally small step size. However, larger step sizes are beneficial for generalization in practice, so it would be interesting to understand the validity of the NTK approximation in that setting. Another limitation is that our result applies only to the square loss and not to other popular losses such as the cross-entropy loss. Indeed, the known bounds in the setting of general losses require either a ""well-conditioning"" assumption or taking α exponential in the training time T. Can one prove bounds analogous to Theorem 1.2 for more general losses, with α depending polynomially on T, and without conditioning assumptions? A natural question raised by our bounds in Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 is: how do the dynamics behave just outside the regime where the NTK approximation is valid? For models h where Lip(h) and Lip(Dh) are bounded by a constant, can we understand the dynamics in the regime where T ≈Cα for some large constant C and α ≫C, at the edge of the lazy training regime? 4",0,,,,
P090.pdf,"Equivariant Fine-Tuning of Large Pretrained Models Abstract This paper explores the adaptation of large pretrained models to new tasks while preserving their inherent equivariance properties. Equivariance, the property of a model’s output changing predictably with transformations of its input, is crucial for many applications, such as image recognition and physics simulations. However, standard adaptation techniques, like fine-tuning, often disrupt this crucial property, leading to a degradation in performance and generalization. We propose a novel method that leverages the underlying group structure of the data to guide the adap- tation process, ensuring that the adapted model remains equivariant. Our approach combines techniques from group theory and deep learning to achieve this goal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark datasets, showing significant improvements over existing adaptation techniques. The results highlight the importance of preserving equivariance during model adaptation and showcase the potential of our approach for a wide range of applications. 1 Introduction This paper addresses the critical challenge of adapting large pretrained models to new tasks while pre- serving their inherent equivariance properties. Equivariance, a crucial characteristic where a model’s output transforms predictably with input transformations, is essential for numerous applications, including image recognition, physics simulations, and various other domains involving structured data. Standard adaptation methods, such as fine-tuning, often inadvertently disrupt this vital property, leading to performance degradation and reduced generalization capabilities. This disruption stems from the fact that these methods typically ignore the underlying group structure inherent in many datasets, treating the data as unstructured points in a high-dimensional space. The consequence is a loss of the inherent symmetries and relationships that are crucial for robust and generalizable performance. Our work introduces a novel approach that directly addresses this limitation. We propose a method that explicitly leverages the underlying group structure of the data to guide the adaptation process, ensuring that the adapted model retains its equivariance. This is achieved by incorporating a carefully designed regularization scheme derived from group representation theory. This regularization term is integrated into the standard fine-tuning process, acting as a constraint that encourages the adapted model to respect the underlying group symmetries. The key innovation lies in the explicit consideration of the group structure, allowing us to effectively guide the adaptation process while preserving the valuable equivariance properties of the pretrained model. This contrasts sharply with traditional methods that treat the adaptation problem as a purely data-driven optimization problem, neglecting the rich structural information embedded within the data. The proposed method builds upon recent advancements in equivariant neural networks, which have demonstrated significant promise in various domains. However, existing equivariant network architectures primarily focus on training models from scratch. Our contribution lies in extending these techniques to the adaptation setting, enabling us to harness the knowledge encoded in large pretrained models while simultaneously maintaining equivariance. This allows us to leverage the substantial computational investment already made in training these large models, avoiding the need . for extensive training from scratch. The combination of pretrained model knowledge and equivariance preservation offers a powerful approach to efficient and effective model adaptation. We evaluate our method on a diverse range of benchmark datasets encompassing image classification, object detection, and physics simulation tasks. Our results consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional fine-tuning and other state-of-the-art adaptation techniques. We observe significant improvements in generalization performance, particularly in low-data regimes, highlighting the crucial role of equivariance preservation in robust and generalizable model adaptation. Furthermore, our detailed analysis confirms that the proposed regularization scheme effectively prevents the disruption of equivariance during the adaptation process, validating the core principle of our approach. In conclusion, this paper presents a novel and effective method for adapting large pretrained models while preserving their valuable equivariance properties. Our approach offers a significant advancement in model adaptation, enabling the efficient and effective utilization of pretrained models in a wider range of applications. The results demonstrate the importance of considering group symmetries during model adaptation and showcase the potential of our method for various domains. Future work will focus on extending our method to more complex group structures and exploring its applications in other challenging scenarios. 2 Related Work This section reviews existing literature relevant to our work on equivariant adaptation of large pretrained models. Our approach builds upon two primary lines of research: (1) the development of equivariant neural networks and (2) the adaptation of pretrained models. We discuss these areas separately and then highlight the key distinctions of our proposed method. The field of equivariant neural networks has witnessed significant progress in recent years. These networks are designed to explicitly incorporate group symmetries into their architecture, ensuring that the model’s output transforms predictably under group actions on the input. Various architectures have been proposed, including those based on group convolutions, tensor representations, and other techniques. These methods have demonstrated impressive results in various domains, such as image classification, point cloud processing, and scientific simulations. However, most existing work focuses on training equivariant networks from scratch, which can be computationally expensive and require large amounts of labeled data. Our work addresses this limitation by focusing on adapting pretrained models, leveraging the knowledge encoded in these models while preserving equivariance. The adaptation of pretrained models is a well-established area of research in deep learning. Techniques such as fine-tuning, transfer learning, and domain adaptation have been widely used to adapt pretrained models to new tasks and domains. These methods typically involve adjusting the weights of the pretrained model on a smaller dataset specific to the target task. However, standard adaptation techniques often fail to preserve the equivariance properties of the pretrained model, leading to performance degradation. This is because these methods typically treat the data as unstructured points in a high-dimensional space, ignoring the underlying group structure. Our work addresses this limitation by explicitly incorporating the group structure into the adaptation process, ensuring that the adapted model retains its equivariance. Several works have explored the intersection of equivariance and model adaptation. For instance, some studies have investigated adapting equivariant networks to new tasks using techniques such as knowledge distillation or meta-learning. However, these methods often involve significant mod- ifications to the network architecture or training process. Our approach offers a more direct and efficient method for preserving equivariance during adaptation, by incorporating a regularization term derived from group representation theory into the standard fine-tuning process. This allows us to leverage the benefits of both pretrained models and equivariant networks without requiring significant architectural changes. In contrast to previous work, our method uniquely combines the strengths of pretrained models and equivariant neural networks within a unified adaptation framework. We leverage the knowledge encoded in large pretrained models to accelerate the adaptation process and improve performance, while simultaneously preserving the crucial equivariance properties through a carefully designed regularization scheme. This allows us to achieve superior performance and generalization compared 2 to existing adaptation techniques, particularly in low-data regimes where preserving the inherent symmetries of the data is crucial. Our approach provides a powerful and efficient method for adapting large pretrained models to new tasks while maintaining their valuable equivariance properties. 3 Methodology This section details the proposed method for equivariantly adapting large pretrained models. Our approach leverages the underlying group structure of the data to guide the adaptation process, ensuring that the adapted model retains its equivariance properties. This is achieved through a novel regularization scheme integrated into the standard fine-tuning process. The core idea is to constrain the adaptation process such that the model’s output transforms predictably under group actions on the input, even after adaptation to a new task. This contrasts with traditional fine-tuning, which often disrupts these crucial symmetries. We achieve this by explicitly incorporating knowledge of the group structure into the optimization process, rather than treating the data as unstructured points in a high-dimensional space. The method is designed to be flexible and applicable to a wide range of pretrained models and group structures. The computational cost is a consideration, particularly for large models and complex groups, but the benefits in terms of improved generalization and robustness often outweigh this cost. Further optimization strategies are explored in the discussion section. Our method begins by identifying the relevant group structure inherent in the data. This involves determining the appropriate group actions and representations that capture the symmetries of the input and output spaces. For example, in image processing, this might involve the group of rotations and translations. Once the group structure is identified, we construct a regularization term based on group representation theory. This term penalizes deviations from equivariance during the adaptation process. Specifically, the regularization term measures the discrepancy between the model’s output under a group action and the transformed output predicted by the model. This discrepancy is minimized during training, ensuring that the adapted model remains approximately equivariant. The strength of the regularization is controlled by a hyperparameter, allowing for a trade-off between equivariance preservation and adaptation to the new task. The choice of this hyperparameter is crucial and is determined through cross-validation. The regularization term is incorporated into the standard fine-tuning loss function. The overall loss function is then a weighted sum of the task-specific loss (e.g., cross-entropy for classification) and the equivariance regularization term. The weights determine the relative importance of task performance and equivariance preservation. The adapted model is trained by minimizing this combined loss function using standard optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam. The specific optimization algorithm and hyperparameters are chosen based on the characteristics of the dataset and the pretrained model. Careful selection of these hyperparameters is crucial for achieving optimal performance. We employ a grid search to identify the best hyperparameter settings for each experiment. The implementation of our method involves modifying the standard fine-tuning process to include the equivariance regularization term. This requires access to the pretrained model’s weights and architecture, as well as the group representation associated with the data. The regularization term is computed efficiently using techniques from group representation theory, minimizing the com- putational overhead. The modified training process is implemented using standard deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The code is publicly available to facilitate reproducibility and further research. The implementation details, including the specific group representations and optimization strategies, are provided in the supplementary material. Finally, the adapted model is evaluated on a held-out test set to assess its performance on the new task. The evaluation metrics are chosen based on the specific task, such as accuracy for classification or mean average precision (mAP) for object detection. The performance of the adapted model is compared to that of models adapted using traditional fine-tuning and other state-of-the-art adaptation techniques. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in preserving equivariance while achieving high performance on the new task. A detailed analysis of the results is presented in the next section. 3 4 Experiments This section details the experimental setup, datasets used, and results obtained using our proposed method for equivariantly adapting large pretrained models. We evaluate our approach on a variety of tasks and datasets, comparing its performance against traditional fine-tuning and other state-of-the-art adaptation techniques. Our experiments focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in preserving equivariance while achieving high performance on the target tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. We also analyze the impact of the proposed regularization scheme on the adapted model’s equivariance properties. The results highlight the importance of considering group symmetries during model adaptation and showcase the potential of our approach for various applications. The computational cost of our method is also considered, and strategies for mitigating this are discussed. Our experiments involve three distinct tasks: image classification, object detection, and a physics simulation task involving the prediction of fluid dynamics. For image classification, we utilize the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, focusing on adapting pretrained ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B7 models. The group structure considered is the group of rotations and translations, represented using appropriate group convolutions. For object detection, we employ the COCO dataset and adapt a pretrained Faster R-CNN model. Here, the group structure is again the group of rotations and translations, but the regularization is adapted to the specific architecture of the object detection model. Finally, for the physics simulation task, we use a dataset of fluid flow simulations, adapting a pretrained convolutional neural network. The group structure in this case is the group of spatial translations and reflections. In all cases, we carefully select the hyperparameters of our method, including the regularization strength and optimization algorithm, using cross-validation. The results consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional fine-tuning and other adaptation techniques. Table 1 summarizes the performance of our method across the three tasks, showing significant improvements in accuracy and generalization performance, especially in low-data regimes. The improvements are particularly noticeable in scenarios where preserving equivariance is crucial, such as when dealing with rotated or translated images. This highlights the importance of explicitly considering group symmetries during model adaptation. Furthermore, our analysis confirms that the proposed regularization scheme effectively prevents the disruption of equivariance during the adaptation process, as measured by the discrepancy between the model’s output under group actions and the transformed output. This validates the core principle of our approach. Table 1: Performance comparison of our method against traditional fine-tuning and other adaptation techniques across three tasks. Method Image Classification (CIFAR-10) Object Detection (COCO) Physics Simulation Fine-tuning 85.2% 32.5 mAP 0.85 RMSE Method A (State-of-the-art) 88.1% 35.1 mAP 0.80 RMSE Our Method 90.5% 37.8 mAP 0.72 RMSE The computational cost of our method is a consideration, particularly for large models and complex group structures. However, the significant improvements in performance and generalization often outweigh this cost. We explore strategies for mitigating the computational overhead, such as using efficient group convolution implementations and employing techniques like stochastic optimization. Further research is needed to optimize the computational efficiency of our method, particularly for extremely large models and complex group structures. Despite this, the results presented demonstrate the significant potential of our approach for equivariantly adapting large pretrained models to new tasks. Future work will focus on further optimizing the computational efficiency and exploring applications to even more complex scenarios. 5 Results This section presents the results of our experiments evaluating the proposed method for equivariantly adapting large pretrained models. We conducted experiments across three diverse tasks: image classification, object detection, and physics simulation. Our primary goal was to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving equivariance while achieving high performance on the 4 target tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. We compared our method against traditional fine-tuning and other state-of-the-art adaptation techniques, focusing on metrics that reflect both task performance and the preservation of equivariance. The results consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach, highlighting the importance of explicitly considering group symmetries during model adaptation. For image classification, we used the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, adapting pretrained ResNet- 50 and EfficientNet-B7 models. The group structure considered was the group of rotations and translations, implemented using group convolutions. Table 2 shows the classification accuracy achieved by our method, compared to fine-tuning and a state-of-the-art adaptation technique (Method A). Our method consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving a significant improvement in accuracy, especially in the low-data regime (10% of the training data). This improvement is attributed to the preservation of equivariance, which enhances the model’s ability to generalize to unseen rotations and translations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our regularization scheme in maintaining the model’s equivariance properties while adapting to the new task. Table 2: Image Classification Accuracy Method CIFAR-10 (Full Data) CIFAR-10 (10% Data) ImageNet (10% Data) Fine-tuning 92.1% 78.5% 65.2% Method A 93.5% 82.1% 68.9% Our Method 94.8% 85.7% 72.3% In object detection experiments using the COCO dataset and a pretrained Faster R-CNN model, we observed similar trends. The group structure considered was again rotations and translations. Table 3 shows the mean Average Precision (mAP) achieved by different methods. Our method significantly outperforms both fine-tuning and Method A, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in preserving equivariance in a more complex task. The improvement in mAP suggests that our method enhances the model’s robustness to variations in object pose and location. This is particularly important in real-world scenarios where objects may appear in various orientations and positions. Table 3: Object Detection mAP Method COCO mAP Fine-tuning 38.2 Method A 41.5 Our Method 44.9 Finally, for the physics simulation task involving fluid dynamics, we used a dataset of fluid flow simulations and adapted a pretrained convolutional neural network. The group structure was spatial translations and reflections. Our method achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.75, significantly lower than the 0.88 RMSE achieved by fine-tuning and the 0.82 RMSE achieved by Method A. This demonstrates the applicability of our approach to tasks beyond image processing and its effectiveness in preserving equivariance in complex physical systems. The lower RMSE indicates improved accuracy in predicting fluid dynamics, highlighting the benefits of preserving the underlying symmetries of the physical system during model adaptation. The consistent improvements across diverse tasks and datasets strongly support the effectiveness of our proposed method. Further analysis, including visualizations of the adapted models’ responses to group actions, is provided in the supplementary material. 6 Conclusion This paper presents a novel method for adapting large pretrained models to new tasks while preserving their inherent equivariance properties. Standard adaptation techniques often disrupt this crucial property, leading to performance degradation and reduced generalization. Our approach directly addresses this limitation by explicitly leveraging the underlying group structure of the data to guide the adaptation process. This is achieved through a carefully designed regularization scheme, 5 derived from group representation theory, that is integrated into the standard fine-tuning process. This regularization term penalizes deviations from equivariance, ensuring that the adapted model maintains its predictable transformation behavior under group actions on the input. Our method builds upon recent advances in equivariant neural networks, extending these techniques to the adaptation setting. This allows us to leverage the knowledge encoded in large pretrained models while simultaneously preserving equivariance, offering a powerful approach to efficient and effective model adaptation. We evaluated our method on diverse benchmark datasets encompassing image classification, object detection, and physics simulation tasks. The results consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional fine-tuning and other state-of-the-art adaptation techniques, showing significant improvements in generalization performance, particularly in low-data regimes. This highlights the crucial role of equivariance preservation in robust and generalizable model adaptation. The consistent improvements across diverse tasks and datasets strongly support the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our analysis confirms that the proposed regularization scheme effectively prevents the disruption of equivariance during the adaptation process. This validates the core principle of our approach: that explicitly considering group symmetries during model adaptation leads to superior performance and generalization. The observed improvements are particularly significant in scenarios where preserving equivariance is crucial, such as when dealing with rotated or translated images or in tasks involving structured data with inherent symmetries. While our method demonstrates significant improvements, there are limitations to consider. The computational cost can be relatively high, especially for large models and complex group structures. Future work will focus on developing more efficient algorithms to address this limitation, potentially exploring techniques such as stochastic optimization and more efficient implementations of group convolutions. Furthermore, we plan to extend our method to more complex group structures and explore its applications in other challenging scenarios, such as adapting models for different modalities or handling noisy or incomplete data. In conclusion, this work provides a significant advancement in model adaptation, enabling the efficient and effective utilization of pretrained models in a wider range of applications. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering group symmetries during model adaptation and showcase the potential of our approach for various domains. The ability to adapt large pretrained models while preserving equivariance opens up exciting possibilities for leveraging the power of these models in a wider range of applications, particularly those involving structured data and inherent symmetries. 6 ",0,,,,
P091.pdf,"An Investigation into Named Entity Recognition for Call Center Transcripts to Ensure Privacy Law Compliance Abstract This study explores the application of Named Entity Recognition (NER) on a novel form of user-generated text, specifically call center conversations. These dialogues present unique challenges, blending the complexities of spontaneous speech with issues specific to conversational Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), such as inaccuracies. By employing a custom corpus with manual annotations, training contextual string embeddings, and implementing a BiLSTM-CRF model, we achieve results that are on par with the state-of-the-art for this new task. 1 Introduction This paper addresses the crucial need to identify and handle sensitive personal information within call center transcripts, which are generated as a result of speech recognition systems. Although these transcripts are typically redacted for Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance, they still often contain a caller’s name and internal ID number, which can be useful for quality assurance. However, new privacy laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU, establish stringent guidelines concerning data collection, storage, and an individual’s right to withdraw consent for data usage. To adhere to these regulations without losing the data’s value, it is essential to pinpoint non-public personal and personally identifiable information (NPI/PII) in call transcripts. We utilize Named Entity Recognition (NER) to locate instances of NPI/PII within the transcripts, remove them, and replace them with appropriate tags that denote the type of removed data. For instance, a transcript such as ""This is john doe reference number 12345"" would be transformed into ""This is [NAME] reference number [NUMBER]"". This task is distinctive to call centers for several reasons. First, these transcripts consist of natural human conversations, which have many common problems of user-generated content such as incomplete sentences and unusual words. Furthermore, transcript text is produced by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, which are susceptible to errors, as will be described in Section 3.1. Even though modern ASR systems are usually reliable, the source audio is from phone calls, which is often low quality and contains background noise. The poor audio quality leads to incorrect ASR, producing ungrammatical sentences. This makes understanding the call semantics and identifying features essential to NER systems more difficult. Moreover, call transcripts frequently lack capitalization, numeric digits, and proper punctuation, which are crucial features for classic NER methods. Also, traditional NER systems are inadequate for handling emails, addresses, or spellings, which makes it difficult to use pre-trained NER models. In this paper, we apply the current best neural network architecture for sequence labeling, a BiLSTM- CRF, to the task of identifying NPI and PII in call transcripts. We match the state-of-the-art perfor- mance on standard datasets by using our model with annotated data and custom contextual string embeddings. 2 Related Work Named Entity Recognition has become a focus in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly since the Message Understanding Conferences (MUCs) in the 1990s. The CoNLL2003 shared task in 2003 concentrated on language-independent NER and popularized feature based systems. The OntoNotes corpus, released in 2006, has been vital to the progress of NER research. Following the CoNLL task, Conditional Random Field (CRF) based models became the most successful, which requires that features be manually produced. Current research utilizes neural networks to generate these features. Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory models with a CRF layer (BiLSTM-CRF) have been used successfully on CoNLL2000 and CoNLL2003 datasets. A BiLSTM- CNN-CRF has been used for NER on the CoNLL2003 dataset, producing superior results. Similar results were achieved by a BiLSTM-CNN with features from word embeddings and the lexicon. Embeddings have been used for both words and entity types to create more robust models. Flair, with character-based embeddings and a pooling approach, has set the state of the art. Crossweigh uses Flair embeddings to address mishandled annotations. In 2006, the word confidence scores from ASR systems were used as a feature for NER. Similar experiments were done on French radio and TV audio. Neither of those used natural conversation, and the quality of the audio was superior, making ASR a more accurate task. 2.1 Conversations are Different: The Twitter Analogy Much of the past research has used newswire datasets. While newswire data is expected to conform to standard text conventions, call center transcripts do not have these conventions. This presents a problem for the usual approaches to NER and is further complicated by our poor audio quality. Speaker 1: Thank you for calling our company how may i help you today. Speaker 2: Id like to pay my bill. Table 1: An example of turns of a conversation, where each person’s line in the dialogue represents their turn. This output matches the format of our data described in Section 3. The most similar research area to this is work on Twitter data. Similar to our transcripts, tweets are user-generated and may not have conventional grammar or spelling. Initial research tackled this problem with a K-nearest neighbors model combined with a CRF. A model combining a multi-step neural network with a CRF output layer achieved first place in the 2017 Workshop on Noisy User- generated Text (W-NUT). The success of pooled contextualized string embeddings was also shown with this data. We use prior work on tweets to direct our model creation for call center data. 3 Data Our dataset includes 7,953 training, 500 validation, and 534 test samples. Each sample represents a complete speaker turn from a debt collection call center. A speaker turn is defined as a complete transcription from one speaker before another speaker starts, as shown in Table 1. The training set is a random sample of turns from 4 months of call transcripts. The transcripts were generated using a proprietary speech recognition system, which outputs all lowercase transcripts without punctuation or numeric digits. We used spaCy to convert each turn to a document that begins with a capital letter and ends with a period, as this is the default for spaCy. In order to make use of entities, a Sentencizer module was added, which defaults to this capitalization and period structure. 3.1 Data Annotation We created a schema for annotating the training and validation data with different types of NPI/PII, which are shown in Table 2. Initial annotations were performed using Doccano. The annotators were trained in NPI/PII recognition, and were instructed to err on the side of caution in unclear instances. Ambiguity often came from errors in the ASR model. The lack of audio meant it was sometimes unclear if ""I need oak leaves"" was actually ""Annie Oakley"". The opposite was also true such as when ""Brilliant and wendy jeff to 2 Entity Type Description NUMBERS A sequence of numbers related to a customer’s information (e.g. phone numbers or internal ID number) NAME First and last name of a customer or agent COMPANY The name of a company ADDRESS A complete address, including city, state, and zip code EMAIL Any email address SPELLING Language that clarifies the spelling of a word (e.g. ""c as in cat"") Table 2: A brief description of our annotation schema. process the refund"" was actually ""Brilliant and when did you want to process the refund"". Emails were also difficult, as errors in ASR made it difficult to determine the bounds of the email address. Also, the transcripts were pre-redacted for PCI compliance. This redaction can obscure important data, for example, sometimes a customer ID is redacted as part of the PCI redaction process. To lessen false negatives, we use context to include the [redacted] tag as part of the numbers sequence when possible. No steps to clean the transcripts were taken; the natural noise in the data was left for the model to interpret. Due to limitations with spaCy and the complexity of nested entities, we only allowed one annotation per word in the dataset. This means, for instance, that ""c a t as in team at gmail dot com"" would be labeled either as SPELLING[0:6] EMAIL[6:] or as EMAIL[0:] with the indices corresponding to the position of words in the text. This ultimately results in a lower count of SPELLING entities, because these are often part of EMAIL or ADDRESS entities, which influences our analysis in Section 6. 4 Model Design We utilized a standard BiLSTM-CRF model in PyTorch, adapted from a GitHub repository. We wrote our own main.py to use our spaCy preprocessing, and adapted the code to handle batch processing. After preprocessing, we trained the model on the training set and used the validation set for model tuning. All numbers in this paper are reported on the test set. A visualization of our model is shown in Figure 1. 5 Experiments 5.1 Basic Hyperparameter Tuning We used a grid search algorithm to maximize model performance. The word embedding layer uses FastText embeddings trained on the client’s call transcripts. This aids in mitigating the impacts of poor ASR, and this will be explored in Sections 5.2 and 5.3. The grid search included the parameters: epochs (a sampled distribution between 5 and 50), the size of a dropout layer (between 0 and 0.5, with 0.1 intervals of search), the number of hidden layers (between 5 and 20 in increments of 5), and the encoding type used in the output of the CRF (BIO, BILOU, IO). The other hyperparameters were a learning rate of .001, a batch size of 1, 30 nodes in each fully connected layer, and the inclusion of bias in each layer. The experiments were run in parallel on a virtual machine with 16 CPUs and 128 GB of memory. Each experiment took a few hours to run. To understand the performance of the model, we broke down the measurements of precision, recall, and F1 by entity type. Table 3 shows these results for the best model configuration. This model used 46 epochs, a dropout rate of 0.2, 5 hidden layers, and a BIO encoding. 5.2 Training Word Embeddings Most past research has fine-tuned existing word embeddings, but the task of mitigating misrecognition seemed more complex than domain adaptation. To lessen the impact of the errors, we understand that frequent misrecognitions appear in contexts similar to the intended word. A custom model gives a misrecognized word a vector similar to the word it should be and not to the other meaning it has. The importance of domain specific word embeddings when using ASR data has been shown in research. 3 We ran our best performing model with the 300 dimensional GloVe 6b word embeddings. Our embeddings were trained on roughly 216 million words. The results from the best epoch of this model (16) are shown in Table 3. 2*Entity Type Precision Recall F1 Custom GloVe Custom GloVe Custom GloVe O 89.8 84.2 81.7 76.6 85.6 80.2 NUMBERS 95.6 88.7 85.4 82.9 90.1 85.7 NAME 89.6 92.1 91.1 88.7 90.3 90.3 COMPANY 98.8 99.5 72.9 64.3 83.9 78.1 ADDRESS 70.6 0.3 75.0 18.7 72.7 23 EMAIL 0 07.1 0 03.1 0 04.4 SPELLING 45.8 34 52.4 40.5 48.9 37.0 Micro Average 89.2 85.6 79.6 74.0 84.1 79.4 Table 3: The performance by entity type of the BiLSTM-CRF model on the held out test set. This table compares the results of our custom embeddings model (""Custom"") against the GloVe embeddings (""GloVe""). 5.3 Using Flair Previous experiments highlighted the importance of custom word embeddings to account for mis- recognition in call center transcripts. Here, we test the performance of Flair and its contextual string embeddings. We begin by training custom contextual string embeddings based on the results of the first experiments. We use the same corpus as in Section 5.1. The tutorial on the Flair GitHub page was used with the following parameters: hidden size: 1024, sequence length: 250, mini batch size: 100. We use the newline to indicate a document change, and each turn as a separate document for consistency. The model’s validation loss stabilized after epoch 4, and the best version of the model was used. We conduct experiments using Flair’s SequenceTagger with default parameters and a hidden size of 256. Flair uses only the custom trained Flair embeddings. Flair + FastText uses the custom trained Flair embeddings and the custom trained FastText embeddings using Flair’s StackedEmbeddings. Flairmean pooling uses only the custom trained Flair embeddings within Flair’s PooledFlairEmbed- ding. Mean pooling was used. Flairmean pooling + FastText uses PooledFlairEmbeddings with mean pooling and the custom trained FastText embeddings using Flair’s StackedEmbeddings. These results are shown in Table 4.

The Flair embeddings show a large improvement over other word embeddings; however all four varieties of Flair models have nearly identical Micro Average F1s. The best performing Flair models are those that use both the custom contextualized string embeddings and the custom FastText embeddings. Across all of the models in this paper, EMAIL and SPELLING consistently performed worse than other categories. This is due to the overlap in their occurrences and their variable appearance. The custom embeddings model often identified parts of an email correctly but labeled some aspects, such as a name, as NAME followed by EMAIL instead of labeling the whole thing as EMAIL. SPELLING often appears within an EMAIL entity. Due to the previously discussed limitations, the SPELLING entity had a limited presence in our training data, with many EMAIL and ADDRESS entities containing examples of SPELLING. All models frequently misidentified EMAIL as SPELLING and vice versa. Additionally, the test data had a number of turns that consisted of only SPELLING, which was poorly represented in training. The Flairmean pooling model outperforms the other models in EMAIL by a large margin. The results in Table 4 highlight that the NUMBERS category contains strings that appear frequently in the text. There are a finite number of NUMBER words in our corpus (those numeric words along with many instances of ""[redacted]""), and the numbers of interest in our dataset appear in very similar contexts and do not often get misrecognized. The COMPANY entity performs well for similar reasons; when the model was able to identify the company name correctly, it was often in a common error form and in a known context. The model’s failures can be attributed to the training data because the company name is a proper noun that is not in standard ASR language models, including the one we used. Thus, it is often misrecognized since the language model has higher probabilities assigned to grammatically correct phrases that have nothing to do with the company name. This causes variability in appearance, which means that not every version of the company name was present in our training set. Interesting variability also occurred in ADDRESS entities. Both models that used Flair and FastText embeddings strongly outperformed the models that used only Flair, and standard Flair embeddings strongly outperformed the Pooled Flair embeddings. Neither version of the Flair-only model identified addresses in which numbers were shown as ""[redacted]"" but both models that utilized FastText had no issue with these instances. 7 Conclusion and Future Work Through the use of a BiLSTM-CRF model, paired with custom-trained Flair embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art NER performance on a new call center conversation dataset with distinct entity types. We also show the importance of training word embeddings that fully capture the intricacies of the task. Although we cannot release our data for privacy, we have shown that existing state-of-the-art techniques can be applied to less common datasets and tasks. Future work will include evaluating the model with call transcripts from other industries. We would also like to explore how well these techniques work on other user-generated conversations like chats and emails. 5",0,,,,
P092.pdf,"Enhanced Image Compression Through Advanced Residual Network Architectures Abstract This manuscript provides an in-depth explanation of the methodology developed for a recent image compression challenge. The method primarily incorporates two innovative aspects: the application of advanced residual networks for enhanced compression and the utilization of sub-pixel convolution techniques for efficient up-sampling during decompression. The efficacy of these methodologies, which achieved a high Multiscale Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM) of 0.972 under a strict bit rate constraint of 0.15 bits per pixel (bpp) while maintaining reasonable computational demands during the evaluation stage. 1 Introduction Image compression remains a crucial research area within the field of signal processing, aiming to facilitate more efficient data storage and transfer. Conventional image compression algorithms, like the various JPEG standards, often employ manually designed encoder/decoder frameworks. However, with the emergence of novel image formats and the proliferation of high-resolution mobile devices, there is a growing recognition that existing standards may not represent the most effective or universal solutions for image compression. Recently, deep learning-based techniques have shown a surge of progress in the image compression domain. Some of these methods employ generative models, trained adversarially, to effectively learn the underlying distribution of images, resulting in impressive subjective quality even at exceptionally low bit rates. Other works utilize recurrent neural networks to iteratively compress residual informa- tion, enabling progressive coding which allows for multiple quality levels within a single compression operation. Further advancements have been made by focusing on relaxing quantization constraints and improving entropy modeling, leading to enhanced performance compared to established image compression methods. Nevertheless, identifying an optimal network structure presents a formidable challenge across various machine learning applications, including image compression. This paper primarily discusses two important aspects of network design for image compression. The first concerns the selection of kernel size, a parameter that significantly influences compression effectiveness in traditional algorithms. Motivated by its impact in classical methods, this paper presents experiments that use different filter sizes to prove that larger kernel sizes contribute to improved coding efficiency. Building upon this, a strategy is presented that utilizes a deep residual learning approach, allowing for the maintenance of a broad receptive field while utilizing a reduced number of parameters. This approach not only decreases the model’s overall size but also substantially enhances its performance. Additionally, the architecture of up-sampling operations within the decoder plays a pivotal role in determining the quality of reconstructed images and the presence of artifacts. This issue, extensively studied in the context of super-resolution, involves various implementations for up-sampling layers, such as interpolation, transposed convolution, and sub-pixel convolution. This work compares two commonly used up-sampling methods, transposed and sub-pixel convolutions, to demonstrate their relative performance in the context of image compression. . 2 Methodology The fundamental network architectures employed in this research are based on prior works that have demonstrated state-of-the-art compression performance. The network is structured as a pair of autoencoders. The primary autoencoder is responsible for optimizing the rate-distortion tradeoff inherent in image compression. The loss function can be expressed as: J = λd(x, ˆx) + R(ˆy) (1) where λ is a parameter that balances the importance of rate and distortion. The secondary autoencoder handles the encoding of side information, which is used to model the probability distribution of the compressed data. A Gaussian scale mixture approach is utilized to develop an image-adaptive entropy model, with scale parameters conditioned on a hyperprior. 2.1 From Small Kernel Size to Large Kernel Size In traditional image compression techniques, the size of transform filters significantly affects coding efficiency, especially for high-definition videos. Initially, transform sizes were small, but as the field progressed, there was a gradual shift towards larger sizes to better capture spatial correlations and semantic details. The experiments detailed in this paper, using a standard dataset, explore the impact of different filter sizes in both the main and auxiliary autoencoders. Table 1 indicates that for the Baseline architecture, larger kernel sizes lead to better rate-distortion outcomes. Similarly, Table 2 demonstrates comparable improvements for the HyperPrior architectures. Table 3 reveals that employing large kernels in the auxiliary autoencoder does not enhance rate-distortion performance and may even negatively impact it. This is likely due to the small size of the compressed codes, which makes smaller kernels sufficient for effective encoding. An excessive number of trainable parameters can hinder the learning process. Table 1: The effect of kernel size on Baseline on Kodak, optimized by MSE with λ = 0.015.

Initial attempts to substitute a large kernel with multiple 3x3 filters encountered convergence issues during training. To address this, shortcut connections were incorporated between adjacent 3x3 kernels. The resultant deep residual network 2 architecture for image compression is denoted as ResNet-3x3(4), signifying that a stack of four 3x3 kernels achieves an equivalent receptive field to a 9x9 kernel. To minimize parameter overhead, GDN/IGDN activation functions are applied only once within each residual unit when the output dimensions change. For the remaining convolutional layers, parameter-free Leaky ReLU activations are employed to introduce non-linearity. As indicated in Table 4, ResNet-3x3(4) surpasses both ResNet-3x3(3) and Hyperprior-9 in terms of performance. Table 4: Comparison of residual networks and upsampling operations on Kodak, optimized by MS-SSIM with λ = 5.

While down-sampling at the encoder is typically achieved using strided convolution filters, up-sampling at the decoder can be implemented through various methods, such as bicubic interpolation, transposed convolution, and sub-pixel convolution. Considering the importance of rapid end-to-end learning, bicubic interpolation was excluded, and a comparison was made between the two widely used up-sampling techniques: transposed convolution (TConv) and sub-pixel convolution (SubPixel). To implement sub-pixel convolution, the channel count is expanded fourfold, followed by the application of a depth-to-space operation. The results presented in Table 4 demonstrate that sub-pixel convolution filters offer slight improvements in both PSNR and MS-SSIM compared to transposed convolution filters. 3 Experiments For the training process, 256x256 image patches were extracted from a large-scale image dataset. A batch size of 8 was employed, and training was conducted for up to 2 million iterations to ensure stable convergence. Optimization was performed using the Adam optimizer, with an initial learning rate of 1 x 10<sup>-4</sup>, reduced to 1 x 10<sup>-5</sup> for the final 80,000 iterations. Two primary strategies were implemented. The first strategy, termed ""Wide Bottleneck,"" involves increasing the model’s capacity by expanding the number of filters. Since increasing filters in large feature maps significantly increases computational cost (FLOPs), the filter count was only raised in the encoder’s final layer, from 128 to 192. This results in a minor FLOPs increase, as detailed in Table 5. While Bottleneck192 effectively reduces the bit rate, it also leads to some quality degradation compared to Bottleneck128. Table 5: The effect of wide bottleneck on Kodak dataset.

For achieving a target bit rate, two models are trained at distinct bit rates by adjusting the λ parameter. This allows for adaptive selection during encoding to approach the target bit rate while maximizing MS-SSIM, as shown in Table 6. A single bit is added to the bitstream to indicate the model used for decoding, without increasing decoder complexity. 4 Results Table 7 summarizes the compression performance of the proposed methods on a validation dataset. 3 Table 6: Rate control on validation dataset.

This section analyzes the parameter count and model complexity in terms of floating-point operations per second (FLOPs) for various architectures. Specifically, using the HyperPrior-9 architecture as an example, Table 8 provides a layer-wise breakdown of model size. The number of parameters and FLOPs are calculated as follows: Para = (h × w × Cin + 1) × Cout (2) FLOPs = Para × H′ × W ′ (3) where h × w represents the kernel size, H′ × W ′ denotes the output dimensions, and Cin and Cout are the number of input and output channels, respectively. The +1 term is omitted when no bias is used. Quantization and leaky-ReLU are parameter-free. GDN operates across channels but not spatial positions, resulting in a parameter count of (Cin + 1) × Cout. The total FLOPs for GDN and inverse GDN calculations are minimal. This analysis primarily focuses on the backbone of convolutional layers, so the FLOPs of GDN, inverse GDN, and factorized prior are not included in the comparison. Table 9 presents a comparison of different architectures, with the last column showing the relative FLOPs using Baseline-5 as the reference. The proposed models achieve improved coding performance with relatively low computational complexity. 5 Conclusion This manuscript details the proposed deep residual learning framework and sub-pixel convolution technique for image compression, forming the foundation of the submitted entries: Kattolab, Katto- labv2, and KattolabSSIM. The results demonstrate that these approaches achieve a high MS-SSIM of 0.972 under a bit rate constraint of 0.15 bpp, while maintaining a moderate level of computational complexity during the validation phase. 4 Table 8: The model size analysis of HyperPrior-9. !

P093.pdf,"Premature Termination Strategy for Deep Image Prior Abstract Deep Image Prior (DIP) and its variations have demonstrated significant promise in addressing inverse problems in computational imaging, without the need for separate training data. Often, practical DIP models are significantly overparameterized. These models initially capture the intended visual content during the learning phase and subsequently incorporate potential modeling and observational noise, demonstrating a pattern of initial learning followed by overfitting (ELTO). Consequently, the practical application of DIP depends on an early stopping (ES) mechanism capable of identifying this transitional period. Most previous DIP research in computational imaging has focused on demonstrating the models’ potential by reporting peak performance against ground truth, without providing practical methods to achieve near-peak performance without access to ground truth. This paper aims to overcome this practical limitation of DIP by introducing an efficient ES strategy that reliably identifies near-peak performance across various computational imaging tasks and DIP variants. This ES method, based on the running variance of intermediate reconstructions in DIP, not only surpasses existing methods that are limited to specific conditions but also maintains its effectiveness when combined with techniques aimed at reducing overfitting. 1 Introduction Inverse problems (IPs) are widespread in the field of computational imaging, encompassing tasks from fundamental image denoising, super-resolution, and deblurring to complex 3D reconstruction and significant challenges in scientific and medical imaging. Despite the variety of settings, all these problems involve recovering a visual object x from an observation y = f(x), where f represents the forward physical process. Usually, these visual IPs are underdetermined, meaning x cannot be uniquely ascertained from y. This ambiguity is further complicated by potential modeling inaccuracies (such as using a linear f to approximate a nonlinear process) and observational noise (like Gaussian or shot noise), represented as y ˘2248 f(x). To address nonuniqueness and enhance stability against noise, researchers often integrate a range of problem-specific priors on x when formulating IPs. 2 Related Work There are three primary methods to counteract the overfitting of DIP models. The first one is Regularization: Overfitting is lessened by limiting the size of G˘03b8 to the underparameterization range. Layer-wise weights or the network Jacobian are regularized to regulate the network capacity. The total-variation norm or trained denoisers are used as additional regularizers R(G˘03b8(z)). To prevent overfitting, these techniques need the proper amount of regularization, which varies depending on the kind and degree of noise. They may nevertheless cause overfitting if the regularization level is incorrect. Furthermore, even when they are successful, the performance peak is delayed until the last few iterations, which frequently increases the computing cost by several times. The second method is Noise modeling: In their optimization objective, sparse additive noise is explicitly represented. Regularizers and ES criteria are created especially for Gaussian and shot noise. Subgradient techniques using decreasing step size schedules are being investigated for impulse noise with the ˘21131 loss, and they have shown some early promise. These techniques are ineffective outside of the noise types and levels that they are designed to address, and our understanding of the noise in a particular visual IP is often constrained. The third method is Early stopping (ES): Progress is tracked using a ratio of no-reference blurriness and sharpness, however, as the authors point out, the criterion is only applicable to their modified DIP models. It is unclear how to apply the noise-specific regularizer and ES criterion to unknown noise types and levels. It is suggested to monitor DIP reconstruction by training a coupled autoencoder. Although it performs similarly to ours, the additional autoencoder training significantly increases the overall processing time. By dividing the elements of y into ""training"" and ""validation"" sets, it is possible to simulate validation-based ES in supervised learning. However, in IPs, particularly nonlinear ones (such as blind image deblurring (BID), where y ˘2248 k ˘2217 x and ˘2217 denotes linear convolution), elements of y may not be i.i.d., which could impair the effectiveness of validation. Furthermore, withholding a portion of the observation in y can significantly diminish peak performance. 3 Methodology We advocate for the ES approach because, even when effective, regularization and noise modeling techniques frequently fail to enhance peak performance; instead, they extend it to the final iterations, potentially requiring ten times more iterations than would be necessary to reach the peak in the original DIP models. Furthermore, both approaches necessitate extensive knowledge of the noise type and level, which is often unavailable for most applications. If their essential models and hyperparameters are not appropriately configured, overfitting is likely to persist, and ES will still be necessary. This paper introduces a novel ES criterion applicable to various DIP models, based on monitoring the trend of the running variance in the reconstruction sequence. Detecting transition by running variance: Our lightweight method only involves computing the VAR curve and numerically detecting its valley˘2014 the iteration stops once the valley is detected. To obtain the curve, we set a window size parame- ter W and compute the windowed moving variance (WMV). To robustly detect the valley, we introduce a patience number P to tolerate up to P consecutive steps of variance stagnation. Obviously, the cost is dominated by the calculation of variance per step, which is O(W N ) (N is the size of the visual object). In comparison, a typical gradient update step for solving Eq. (2) costs at least ˘2126(|˘03b8|N ), where |˘03b8| is the number of parameters in the DNN G˘03b8. Since |˘03b8| is typically much larger than W (default: 100), our running VAR and detection incur very little compu- tational overhead. 4 Experiments ES-WMV is tested for DIP in a variety of linear and nonlinear IPs, including image denoising, inpainting, demosaicing, super- resolution, MRI reconstruction, and blind image deblurring. ES-WMV is also systematically assessed for major DIP variants, such as deep decoder, DIP-TV, and GP-DIP, for image denoising. It is shown to be a dependable helper in identifying effective ES points. The specifics of the DIP variants are covered in Appendix A.5. In addition, ES-WMV is contrasted with the primary rival techniques, such as DF-STE, SV-ES, DOP, SB, and VAL. The specifics of the primary ES-based techniques are found in Appendix A.6. Reconstruction quality is evaluated using both PSNR and SSIM, and detection performance is shown using PSNR and SSIM gaps, which are the differences between our detected and peak values. 4.1 Image Denoising The majority of earlier research on DIP overfitting has concentrated on image denoising and often assessed their techniques using only one or two forms of noise with modest noise levels, such as low-level Gaussian noise. We use the traditional 9-image dataset for each noise type, and we create two noise levels˘2014low and high˘2014for each. 4.2 Image Super-Resolution In this task, we try to recover a clean im- age x0 from a noisy downsampled ver- sion y = Dt(x0) + ˘03f5, where Dt(˘00b7) : [0, 1]3˘00d7tH˘00d7tW ˘2192 [0, 1]3˘00d7H˘00d7W is a down- sampling operator that resizes an im- age by the factor t and ˘03f5 models ex- tra additive noise. We consider the fol- lowing DIP-reparametrized formulation . = ˘2225Dt(G˘03b8(z)) ˘2212 y˘22252 min˘03b8 ˘2113(˘03b8) F , where G˘03b8 is a trainable DNN parameterized by ˘03b8 and z is a frozen random seed. Then we conduct experiments for 2˘00d7 super- resolution with low-level Gaussian and impulse noise. We test our ES-WMV for DIP and a state-of-the-art zero-shot method based on pre-trained diffusion model˘2014DDNM+ on the standard super-resolution dataset Set14, as shown in Tab. 5, Fig. 11, and Appendix A.7.9. We note that DDNM+ relies on pre-trained models from large external training datasets, while DIP does not. We observe that (1) Our ES-WMV is again able to detect near-peak performance for most images: the average PSNR gap is ˘2264 1.50 and the average SSIM gap is ˘2264 0.07; (2) DDNM+ is sensitive to the noise type and level: from Tab. 5, DDNM+ trained assuming Gaussian noise level ˘03c3y = 0.12 outperforms DIP and DIP+ES-WMV when there is Gaus- sian measurement noise at the level ˘03c3y = 0.12, which is unrealistic in practice, as the noise level is often unknown beforehand. When the noise level is not set correctly, e.g., as ˘03c3y = 0 in the DDNM+ (˘03c3y = .00) row of Tab. 5, the performance of DDNM+ is much worse than that of DIP and DIP+ES-WMV. Also, for super-resolution with impulse noise, DIP is also a clear winner that leads DDNM+ by a large margin; and (3) in Appendix A.8, we show that DDNM+ may also suffer from the overfitting issue. 4.3 MRI Reconstruction We also test ES-WMV on MRI reconstruction, a typical linear IP with a nontrivial forward mapping: y ˘2248 F(x), where F is the subsampled Fourier operator, and we use ˘2248 to indicate that the noise encountered in practical MRI imaging may be hybrid (e.g., additive, shot) and uncertain. Here, we take the 8-fold undersampling and parameterize x using ˘201cConv-Decoder˘201d, a variant of deep decoder. Due to the heavy over-parameterization, overfitting occurs and ES is needed. 2 4.4 Blind Image Deblurring In BID, a blurry and noisy image is given, and the goal is to recover a sharp and clean image. The blur is mostly caused by motion and/or op- tical non-ideality in the camera, and the forward process is often modeled as y = k ˘2217 x + n, where k is the blur kernel, n models additive sensory noise, and ˘2217 is linear convolution to model the spa- tial uniformity of the blur effect. BID is a very challenging visual IP due to bilin- earity: (k, x) 7˘2192 k ˘2217 x. Recently, researchers have tried to use DIP models to solve BID by modeling k and x as two separate DNNs, i.e., min˘03b8k,˘03b8x ˘2225y ˘2212 G˘03b8k (zk) ˘2217 G˘03b8x(zx)˘22252 2 + ˘03bb˘2225˘2207G˘03b8x (zx)˘22251/˘2225˘2207G˘03b8x (zx)˘22252, where the regular- izer is to promote sparsity in the gradient domain for the reconstruction of x, as stan- dard in BID. We follow previous work and choose a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with softmax activation for G˘03b8k , and the canonical DIP model (CNN-based encoder-decoder architecture) for G˘03b8x(zx). We change their regularizer from the original ˘2225˘2207G˘03b8x (zx)˘22251 to the current, as their original formulation is tested only at a very low noise level ˘03c3 = 10˘22125 and no overfitting is observed. We set the test with a higher noise level ˘03c3 = 10˘22123, and find that its original formulation does not work. 5 Results Table 1: Summary of performance of our DIP+ES-WMV and competing methods on image denoising and blind image deblurring (BID). ˘2713: working reasonably well (PSNR ˘2265 2dB less of the original DIP peak); -: not working well (PSNR ˘2264 2dB less of the original DIP peak): N/A: not applicable (i.e., we do not perform comparison due to certain reasons).

In contrast to most competing ES methods that are specific to certain types of noise or DIP models and have limited applicability, our method exhibits broad effectiveness. While there is a method with comparable performance, it significantly increases processing time. Another method, validation-based ES, performs well in simple denoising tasks but falls short in more complex nonlinear IPs like BID. 4 Table 6: ConvDecoder on MRI reconstruction for 30 cases: mean and (std).

This, in turn, prompted an investigation into the aerodynamic properties of flounder fish, as they relates to the flapping of silicone-based fabrics in high-altitude environments. Furthermore, the research team discovered that the optimal method for collecting oxygen samples involved the utilization of antique door knobs, precisely 473 of which were required to facilitate the calibrations necessary for the subsequent experiments. The calibration process itself was hindered by an unexpected infestation of hyper-intelligent, miniature raccoons, which had somehow developed a penchant for reconfiguring the laboratory equipment to resemble a scale model of the Eiffel Tower. To mitigate this issue, the researchers employed a novel technique involving the recitation of original, avant-garde poetry, which served to distract the raccoons while the necessary adjustments were made. This poem, titled ""Ode to a Forgotten Sock,"" consisted of 427 stanzas and was instrumental in ensuring the accuracy of the oxygen readings. As the study progressed, it became apparent that the molecular structure of oxygen was inextricably linked to the harmonic resonance of vintage harmonicas, particularly those manufactured during the height of the American Civil War. A comprehensive review of historical records revealed that the scarcity of harmonicas during this period was directly correlated with a marked decrease in atmospheric oxygen levels, a phenomenon that would come to be known as ""Harmonica-Induced Oxygen Depletion"" (HIOD). The researchers hypothesized that the reintroduction of these harmonicas into modern society could potentially reverse the effects of HIOD, thereby increasing global oxygen levels. Concurrently, the team conducted an exhaustive analysis of the kinesthetic properties of cotton candy, which yielded surprising insights into the viscoelastic nature of oxygen molecules. It was discovered that the crystalline structure of cotton candy exhibited a previously unknown affinity for oxygen, allowing for the creation of a novel, sugar-based filtration system capable of isolating and concentrating oxygen molecules with unprecedented efficiency. This breakthrough innovation 5 was later dubbed the ""Cotton Candy Oxygen Distillation Method"" (CCODM) and is expected to revolutionize the field of oxygen research. In a related development, the researchers found that the seemingly unrelated fields of chaos theory and competitive sandcastle building held the key to understanding the turbulent flow patterns exhibited by oxygen molecules in high-velocity wind tunnels. By applying the principles of fractal geometry and non-linear dynamics, the team was able to optimize the design of their oxygen collection apparatus, resulting in a significant increase in data accuracy and a corresponding decrease in experimental error. This, in turn, enabled the researchers to investigate the heretofore unexplored realm of oxygen- fluorine interactions, yielding a plethora of novel compounds and reactions that are expected to have far-reaching implications for the scientific community. The investigation of these compounds and reactions necessitated the development of a bespoke, oxygen-sensitive spectrophotometer, which was painstakingly crafted from a rare assortment of antique glassware and precision-crafted, titanium-alloy components. The resulting instrument, known as the ""Oxygen-Fluorine Interaction Spectrophotometer"" (OFIS), enabled the researchers to detect and analyze the intricate patterns of molecular vibration that occurred during oxygen-fluorine interactions, providing unparalleled insights into the underlying chemical mechanisms. In a surprising turn of events, the OFIS instrument was found to be susceptible to interference from the resonant frequencies emitted by certain species of rare, exotic orchids, which were subsequently incorporated into the experimental design as a means of modulating the oxygen-fluorine interactions. This unusual approach yielded a wealth of unexpected results, including the discovery of a previously unknown class of oxygen-fluorine compounds that exhibited remarkable stability and reactivity. The researchers have dubbed these compounds ""Orchidinones"" and anticipate that they will have significant implications for the development of novel oxygen-based technologies. The discovery of the Orchidinones prompted a thorough reevaluation of the research methodology, as the team realized that their initial assumptions regarding the molecular structure of oxygen had been overly simplistic. A revised approach, incorporating elements of quantum field theory and topological algebra, was subsequently developed, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the complex interactions between oxygen molecules and their environment. This revised methodology, known as the ""Quantum-Topological Oxygen Framework"" (QTOF), has been hailed as a major breakthrough in the field of oxygen research and is expected to have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the natural world. As the study drew to a close, the researchers reflected on the numerous, unexpected twists and turns that had characterized their investigation, from the initial foray into flamenco dancing to the eventual discovery of the Orchidinones. It was clear that the pursuit of knowledge is often a circuitous and unpredictable journey, full of surprises and challenges, but also full of opportunities for growth and discovery. The team’s experiences served as a poignant reminder of the importance of maintaining a flexible and open-minded approach to scientific inquiry, as well as the need to remain vigilant and adaptable in the face of the unexpected. In the final stages of the study, the researchers turned their attention to the development of a comprehensive, oxygen-themed board game, designed to educate and entertain the general public while promoting a deeper understanding of the complex, often counterintuitive nature of oxygen molecules. This game, titled ""Oxygen Quest,"" features a unique blend of strategy, luck, and molecular- themed challenges, and is expected to become a beloved classic among science enthusiasts and gamers alike. The team’s experiences in developing ""Oxygen Quest"" served as a fitting culmination to their research endeavors, as they reflected on the many, winding pathways that had led them to this point, and looked forward to the exciting, oxygen-filled possibilities that the future held. The game development process also inspired a renewed interest in the aerodynamic properties of various board game components, such as dice, tokens, and game pieces, which were found to exhibit a fascinating array of airflow patterns and turbulence effects. A detailed study of these phenomena, utilizing advanced computational fluid dynamics and wind tunnel testing, revealed a complex interplay between the shape, size, and material properties of the game components and the surrounding air flow. This research has significant implications for the design of more efficient, aerodynamically optimized board games, and may also find applications in the development of novel, oxygen-themed amusement park attractions. 6 Furthermore, the study of board game aerodynamics led to a serendipitous discovery regarding the molecular structure of certain types of plastic, commonly used in the manufacture of game components. It was found that these plastics exhibit a unique, oxygen-sensitive property, which allows them to change color, texture, or shape in response to changes in oxygen concentration. This remarkable phenomenon, known as ""Oxygen-Responsive Plasticity"" (ORP), has the potential to revolutionize the field of materials science, enabling the creation of novel, oxygen-sensitive materials with a wide range of applications, from medical devices to environmental monitoring systems. As the researchers delved deeper into the properties of ORP, they encountered a surprising connection to the world of professional snail racing, where the unique, oxygen-sensitive properties of certain types of plastic were found to be essential for the construction of high-performance snail shells. These shells, crafted from specially formulated ORP materials, allowed the snails to optimize their oxygen intake, resulting in significantly improved racing times and a corresponding increase in snail racing enthusiasts’ excitement and engagement. The team’s findings have sparked a new wave of interest in the sport, as snail racing professionals and enthusiasts alike seek to harness the power of ORP to gain a competitive edge. The intersection of ORP and snail racing also led to a fascinating exploration of the cultural and historical contexts surrounding this unique sport. The researchers discovered that snail racing has a rich, albeit obscure, history, with roots dating back to ancient civilizations, where it was often practiced as a form of spiritual or mystical ritual. This unexpected connection to the world of snail racing served as a poignant reminder of the complex, often hidden relationships between seemingly disparate fields of human endeavor, and the importance of maintaining a broad, interdisciplinary perspective in the pursuit of knowledge. In conclusion, the researchers’ journey through the realm of oxygen research has been a long, winding, and fascinating path, filled with unexpected twists and turns, surprising discoveries, and novel insights. From the initial foray into flamenco dancing to the eventual discovery of ORP and its connection to snail racing, the team has consistently demonstrated a commitment to interdisciplinary exploration, intellectual curiosity, and a willingness to challenge conventional assumptions.

P095.pdf,"JueWu-MC: Achieving Sample-Efficient Minecraft Gameplay through Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Abstract Learning rational behaviors in open-world games such as Minecraft continues to pose a challenge to Reinforcement Learning (RL) research, due to the combined difficulties of partial observability, high-dimensional visual perception, and delayed rewards. To overcome these challenges, we propose JueWu-MC, a sample-efficient hierarchical RL method that incorporates representation learning and imitation learning to handle perception and exploration. Our approach has two levels of hierarchy: the high-level controller learns a policy to manage options, while the low-level workers learn to solve each sub-task. To boost learning of sub-tasks, we propose a combination of techniques including: 1) action-aware represen- tation learning, which captures relations between action and representation; 2) discriminator-based self-imitation learning for efficient exploration; and 3) ensem- ble behavior cloning with consistency filtering for policy robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JueWu-MC significantly enhances sample efficiency and outperforms several baselines. We won the championship of the MineRL 2021 research competition and achieved the highest performance score. 1 Introduction Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved great success in numerous game genres including board games, Atari games, simple first-person-shooter (FPS) games, real-time strategy (RTS) games, and multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games. Recently, open-world games have garnered attention due to their playing mechanisms and their resemblance to real-world control tasks. Minecraft, as a typical open-world game, has been increasingly explored in recent years. Compared to other games, the properties of Minecraft make it an ideal testbed for RL research, because it emphasizes exploration, perception, and construction in a 3D open world. Agents are given partial observability and face occlusions. Tasks in the game are chained and long-term. Humans can typically make rational decisions to explore basic items and construct more complex items with a reasonable amount of practice, while it can be challenging for AI agents to do so autonomously. To facilitate the effective decision-making of agents in playing Minecraft, MineRL has been developed as a research competition platform, which provides human demonstrations and encourages the development of sample-efficient RL agents for playing Minecraft. Since its release, many efforts have been made to develop Minecraft AI agents. However, it remains difficult for current RL algorithms to acquire items in Minecraft due to several factors, which include the following. First, in order to reach goals, the agent is required to complete many sub-tasks that highly depend on each other. Due to the sparse reward, it is difficult for agents to learn long-horizon decisions efficiently. Hierarchical RL from demonstrations has been explored to take advantage of the task structure to accelerate learning. However, learning from unstructured demonstrations without any domain knowledge remains difficult. Second, Minecraft is a flexible 3D first-person game which revolves around gathering resources and creating structures and items. In this environment, agents are required to handle high-dimensional visual input to enable efficient . control. However, the agent’s surroundings are varied and dynamic, which makes it difficult to learn a good representation. Third, with partial observability, the agent needs to explore in the right way and collect information from the environment in order to achieve goals. Naive exploration can waste a lot of samples on useless actions. Self-imitation learning (SIL) is a simple method that learns to reproduce past good behaviors to incentivize exploration, but it is not sample efficient. Lastly, human demonstrations are diverse and often noisy. To address these combined challenges, we propose an efficient hierarchical RL approach, equipped with novel representation and imitation learning techniques. Our method leverages human demonstra- tions to boost the learning of agents, enabling the RL algorithm to learn rational behaviors with high sample efficiency. Hierarchical Planning with Prior. We propose a hierarchical RL (HRL) framework with two levels of hierarchy. The high-level controller extracts sub-goals from human demonstrations and learns a policy to control options, while the low-level workers learn sub-tasks to achieve sub-goals by leveraging demonstrations and interactions with environments. Our approach structures the demonstrations and learns a hierarchical agent, which enables better decisions over long-horizon tasks. We use the following key techniques to boost agent learning. Action-aware Representation Learning. We propose action-aware representation learning (A2RL) to capture the relations between action and representation in 3D visual environments such as Minecraft. A2RL enables effective control and improves the interpretability of the learned policy. Discriminator-based Self-imitation Learning. We propose discriminator-based self-imitation learning (DSIL), which leverages self-generated experiences to learn self-correctable policies for better exploration. Ensemble Behavior Cloning with Consistency Filtering. We propose consistency filtering to identify common human behaviors, and then perform ensemble behavior cloning to learn a robust agent with reduced uncertainty. Our contributions are as follows: 1) We propose JueWu-MC, a sample-efficient hierarchical RL approach, equipped with action-aware representation learning, discriminator-based self-imitation, and ensemble behavior cloning with consistency filtering. 2) Our approach outperforms competitive baselines and achieves the best performance throughout the history of the competition. 2 Related Work 2.1 Game AI Games have long been a testing ground for artificial intelligence research. AlphaGo mastered the game of Go with DRL and tree search. Since then, DRL has been used in other sophisticated games, including StarCraft, Google Football, VizDoom, and Dota. Recently, the 3D open-world game Minecraft has been attracting attention. Previous research has shown that existing RL algorithms can struggle to generalize in Minecraft and a new memory-based DRL architecture was proposed to address this. Another approach combines a deep skill array and a skill distillation system to promote lifelong learning and transfer knowledge among different tasks. Since the MineRL competition began in 2019, many solutions have been proposed to learn to play in Minecraft. These works can be grouped into two categories: 1) end-to-end learning; 2) hierarchical RL with human demonstrations. Our approach belongs to the second category, which leverages the structure of the tasks and learns a hierarchical agent to play in Minecraft. ForgER proposed a hierarchical method with forgetful experience replay, and SEIHAI fully takes advantage of human demonstrations and task structure. 2.2 Sample-efficient Reinforcement Learning Our work aims to create a sample-efficient RL agent for playing Minecraft, and we thereby develop a combination of efficient learning techniques. We discuss the most relevant works below. Our work is related to HRL research that builds upon human priors. One approach proposes to warm-up the hierarchical agent from demonstrations and fine-tune it with RL algorithms. Another approach proposes to learn a skill prior from demonstrations to accelerate HRL algorithms. Compared to existing works, we are faced with highly unstructured demos in 3D first-person video games played 2 by the crowds. We address this challenge by structuring the demonstrations and defining sub-tasks and sub-goals automatically. Representation learning in RL has two broad directions: self-supervised learning and contrastive learning. Self-supervised learning aims to learn rich representations for high-dimensional unlabeled data to be useful across tasks. Contrastive learning learns representations that obey similarity constraints. Our work proposes a self-supervised representation learning method that measures action effects in 3D video games. Existing methods use curiosity or uncertainty as a signal for exploration so that the learned agent is able to cover a large state space. The exploration-exploitation dilemma drives us to develop self- imitation learning (SIL) methods that focus on exploiting past good experiences for better exploration. We propose discriminator-based self-imitation learning (DSIL). 3 Method In this section, we first introduce our overall HRL framework, and then describe each component in detail. 3.1 Overview Our overall framework is shown in Figure 1. We define human demonstrations as D = {τ0, τ1, τ2, ...} where τi is a long-horizon trajectory containing states, actions, and rewards. The provided demon- strations are unstructured, without explicit signals that specify sub-tasks and sub-goals. We define an atomic skill as a skill that gets a non-zero reward. We define sub-tasks and sub-goals based on the atomic skills. To define sub-tasks, we examine the reward delay for each atomic skill, keeping those with long reward delays as individual sub-tasks and merging those with short reward delays into one sub-task. Through this process, we have n sub-tasks in total. To define sub-goals for each sub-task, we extract the most common human behavior pattern and use the last state in each sub-task as its sub-goal. Through this, we have structured demonstrations (D →{D0, D1, ..., Dn−1} ) with sub-tasks and sub-goals used to train the hierarchical agent. With the structured demonstrations, we train the meta-policy using imitation learning and train sub-policies to solve sub-tasks using demonstrations and interactions with the environment. 3.2 Meta- and Sub-policies Meta-policy. We train a meta-policy that maps continuous states to discrete indices (0, 1, ..., n - 1) that specify which option to use. Given state space S and discrete option o ∈O, the meta-policy is defined as πm(θ)(o|s), where s ∈S, o ∈O, and θ represents the parameters. πm(θ)(o|s) specifies the conditional distribution over the discrete options. To train the meta-policy, we generate training data (s, i) where i represents the i-th stage and s ∈Di is sampled from the demonstrations of the i-th stage. The meta-policy is trained using negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss: Lm = −Pn−1 i=0 log πm(i|s) During inference, the meta-policy generates options by taking σ = argmaxoπm(o|s) Sub-policy. In Minecraft, sub-tasks can be grouped into two main types: gathering resources, and crafting items. In the first type (gathering resources), agents need to navigate and gather sparse rewards by observing high-dimensional visual inputs. In the second type (crafting items), agents need to execute a sequence of actions robustly. In typical HRL, the action space of the sub-policies is predefined. However, in the competition, a handcrafted action space is prohibited. Additionally, the action space is obfuscated in both human demonstrations and the environment. Learning directly in this continuous action space is challenging as exploration in a large continuous space can be inefficient. We use KMeans to cluster actions for each sub-task using demonstration Di, and perform reinforcement learning and imitation learning based on the clustered action space. 3 In the following section, we describe how to learn sub-policies efficiently to solve these two kinds of sub-tasks. 3.3 Learning Sub-policies to Gather Resources To efficiently solve these sub-tasks, we propose action-aware representation learning and discriminator-based self-imitation learning to facilitate the learning of sub-policies. The model architecture is shown in Figure 2. Action-aware Representation Learning. To learn compact representations, we observe that in 3D environments, different actions have different effects on high-dimensional observations. We propose action-aware representation learning (A2RL) to capture the relation with actions. We learn a mask net on a feature map for each action to capture dynamic information between the current and next states. Let the feature map be fθ(s) ∈RC×H×W and the mask net be mϕ(s, a) ∈ [0, 1]H×W , where θ and ϕ represent parameters of the policy and mask net. Given a transition tuple (s, a, s′), the loss function for training the mask is: Lm(ϕ) = −Es,a,s′∼D[log(σ((fθ(s′) −gψ(fθ(s))) ⊙mϕ(s, a))) + η(1 −mϕ(s, a))] where gψ is a linear projection function parameterized by learnable parameters ψ; ⊙represents element-wise product, and η is a hyper-parameter that balances two objectives. To optimize the above loss function, we use a two-stage training process. In the first stage, we train the linear projection network gψa using the following objective: Lg(ψa) = Es,a,s′∼D[||fθ(s′) −gψa(fθ(s))||2] This objective learns to recover information of s′ from s in latent space, which is equal to learning a dynamic model to predict the next state given the current state and action. Note that the parameter ψ is dependent on the action a. In the second stage, we fix the learned linear function gψa and optimize the mask net. By minimizing the loss function, the mask net will learn to focus on local parts of the current image that are uncertain to the dynamic model. This is similar to human curiosity, which focuses on that which is uncertain. For policy-based methods, we integrate our learned representations into policy networks. For value- based methods, we combine our learned representations directly with Q-value functions. The learning of the Q-value function can be done using any Q-learning based algorithms. Discriminator-based Self-imitation Learning. We propose discriminator-based self-imitation learning (DSIL). Unlike ASIL, DSIL does not use advantage clipping. Our intuition is that the agent should be encouraged to visit the state distribution that is more likely to lead to goals. To do so, DSIL learns a discriminator to distinguish between states from successful and failed trajectories, and then uses the learned discriminator to guide exploration. We maintain two replay buffers B+ i and B− i to store successful and failed trajectories. During learning, we treat data from B+ i as positive samples and data from B− i as negative samples to train the discriminator. Let the discriminator be Dξ : S →[0, 1] which is parameterized by parameters ξ. We train the discriminator with the objective: maxξEs∈B+ i [log Dξ(s)] + Es∈B− i [1 −log Dξ(s)] The discriminator is encouraged to output high values for good states and low values for bad states. For states that are not distinguishable, Dξ(s) tends to output 0.5. We use the trained discriminator to provide intrinsic rewards for policy learning to guide exploration. The intrinsic reward is defined as: r(s, a, s′) = { + 1ifDξ(s′) > 1 −ϵ −1ifDξ(s′) < ϵ where ϵ ∈(0, 0.5) is a hyper-parameter to control the confidence interval of Dξ. This reward drives the policy to explore in regions that previously led to successful trajectories. DSIL encourages the policy to stay close to a good state distribution, reproduce past decisions, and also be self-correctable. 4 3.4 Learning Sub-policies to Craft Items In this type of sub-task, agents must learn a sequence of actions to craft items. To finish such tasks, agents need to learn a robust policy to execute a sequence of actions. We explore pure imitation learning (IL) to reduce the need for interactions with the environment, due to the limited sample and interaction usage. We propose ensemble behavior cloning with consistency filtering (EBC). Consistency Filtering. Human demonstrations can be diverse and noisy. Directly imitating such noisy data can cause confusion for the policy. Therefore, we perform consistency filtering by extracting the most common pattern of human behaviors. We extract the most common action sequence from demonstrations Di. For each trajectory, we keep those actions that lead to a state change while appearing for the first time to form an action sequence, and count the occurrences of each pattern. We then get the most common action pattern. Afterward, we conduct consistency filtering using the extracted action pattern. Ensemble Behavior Cloning. Learning policy from offline datasets can lead to generalization issues. Policies learned through behavior cloning may become uncertain when encountering unseen out-of-distribution states. To mitigate this, EBC learns a population of policies on different subsets of demonstrations to reduce the uncertainty of the agent’s decision. Specifically, we train K policies on different demonstrations with NLL loss: minθkEs,a∼¯ Dk i [−log πθk(a|s)], ¯ Dk i ⊂¯ Di, k = 1, 2, ..., K where θk parameterizes the k-th policy. During inference, EBC adopts a majority voting mechanism to select an action that is the most confident among the policies. 4 Experiment We conduct experiments using the MineRL environment. Our approach is built based on RL algorithms including SQIL, PPO, and DQfD. 4.1 Main Results Table 1 shows all the MineRL competition results since 2019. The competition settings in 2020 and 2021 were more difficult than in 2019. In these years, participants had to focus on the algorithm design itself. The scores in 2020 and 2021 are lower than in 2019. Our approach outperforms all previous solutions. End-to-end baselines cannot achieve a decent result, showing it is difficult to solve long-horizon tasks with end-to-end learning. Compared to the results of the 2020 competition, our method outperforms other solutions with a score (76.97) that is 3.4x higher than the second place score (22.97). Table 2 shows the conditional success rate of each stage between our approach and SEIHAI. Our approach outperforms SEIHAI in every stage. Figure 3(a) shows the training curves. Due to a version update of MineRL 2021, our online score dropped compared with the performance in our training curve. Our approach is sample-efficient and outperforms prior best results with 0.5 million training samples. Our score reaches 100 with 2.5 million training samples, which is less than the 8 million samples of the MineRL competition. 4.2 Ablation Study To examine the effectiveness of our proposed techniques, we consider three variants of our approach: 1) without A2RL, 2) without DSIL, and 3) without EBC. Figure 3(b) shows the training curves. Each technique contributes to the overall performance. EBC and A2RL contribute more than DSIL. DSIL mainly boosts the performance for later sub-tasks, while A2RL and EBC have earlier effects on the overall pipeline. EBC contributes significantly, demonstrating that learning a robust policy is important for solving long-horizon tasks. 5 4.3 Visualization To understand why our techniques work, we conduct an in-depth analysis. To understand the learned mask in A2RL, we compute saliency maps. For each action, we show the current state, the next state, and the saliency map of the learned mask on the current state. We find that the learned mask captures the dynamic information between two adjacent states, revealing curiosity on the effect of actions. The mask net learns to focus on uncertain parts of the current state. For the ’attack’ action, the learned mask focuses on the objects in front of the agent. For the ’turn left’ and ’turn down’ actions, the mask net focuses on the parts that have major changes due to the rotation and translation of the agent’s perspective. Our learned mask assists the agent in better understanding the 3D environment. To understand how DSIL works, we visualize the state distribution that the agent visits. We compare PPO, PPO+SIL, and PPO+DSIL. At the early training stage, both methods explore randomly and sometimes reach the goal state successfully. After getting samples and training, PPO+DSIL starts to explore in a compact region, while PPO and PPO+SIL still explore in a wider region. DSIL pushes the agent to stay close to a good state distribution, reproducing its past behaviors and exploring in a better way, which incentivizes deep exploration for successful trajectories.

P096.pdf,"Volcanic Eruptions in Relation to Quiche Recipes and the Migration Patterns of Narwhals Abstract The ephemeral nature of volcanic eruptions necessitates an examination of flamenco dancing, which intriguingly intersects with the culinary arts of Japan, particularly in regards to sushi preparation, while simultaneously pondering the aerodynamic properties of chocolate cake, and curiously, the art of playing the harmonica under- water, all of which purportedly influence the magma viscosity in volcanic conduits, ostensibly affecting the frequency of eruptions, and ultimately, the global supply of tartan-patterned socks, in a manner that is both bewildering and fascinating, yet remains largely unexplored in the realm of vulcanology, despite its potential to revolutionize our understanding of volcanic activity, and the ensuing repercussions on the world’s pineapple production. 1 Introduction The ostensibly unrelated fields of astronomy and knitting, surprisingly, hold the key to deciphering the enigmatic patterns of volcanic ash dispersal, which in turn, have a profound impact on the migratory patterns of narwhals, and the concomitant fluctuations in the global market for rare, exotic spices, such as the fabled, and highly prized, ""G’lunkian Fire Salt"", a substance rumored to possess extraordinary, and possibly supernatural, properties, that have captivated the imagination of scholars, and the general public alike, for centuries, and continue to inspire new avenues of research, and inquiry, into the mysterious, and often, inexplicable, world of volcanoes. Furthermore, the heretofore unknown connection between the harmonic resonance of crystal glasses, and the seismic activity of volcanoes, has far-reaching implications for our comprehension of the intricate, and complex, relationships between the Earth’s geology, and the cosmos, and the, as yet, unexplained, phenomenon of ""Volcanic Sonic Boomlets"", which have been observed, and documented, by a select group of, intrepid, researchers, who have dedicated their lives to unraveling the secrets of these enigmatic, and awe-inspiring, natural wonders, and the, often, bizarre, and inexplicable, consequences that arise from their study. The investigation of volcanic activity, therefore, necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, one that incorporates the insights, and methodologies, of a wide range of fields, from the, aforementioned, flamenco dancing, and sushi preparation, to the, more, obscure, and esoteric, realms of ""Extreme Ironing"", and ""Competitive Snail Racing"", all of which, surprisingly, contribute to a deeper understanding of the, complex, and dynamic, systems that govern the behavior of volcanoes, and the, often, unpredictable, and dramatic, events that they produce, which, in turn, have a profound impact on the world, at large, and the, diverse, and, often, seemingly, unrelated, fields of human endeavor, that are, ultimately, connected to, and influenced by, these, mighty, and fascinating, natural phenomena. The fascinating realm of volcanoes has long been a subject of intrigue, much like the intricacies of baking a croquembouche, which, incidentally, requires a deep understanding of thermodynamics and the fluffiness of meringues, a concept that can be tangentially related to the study of glacial movements in Antarctica, where penguins waddle about with an air of nonchalance, oblivious to the impending doom of climate change, a phenomenon that has been exacerbated by the proliferation of plastic straws, which, in turn, has led to a surge in the demand for sustainable alternatives, such as paper straws, that are often used to sip coffee, a beverage that has been shown to have a profound impact on the cognitive abilities of humans, particularly in the field of quantum physics, where the notion of wave-particle duality has been a subject of much debate, rather like the contentious issue of pineapple pizza, which has sparked a heated discussion among gastronomes and food critics, who, in their infinite wisdom, have decreed that the combination of sweet and savory flavors is an abomination, a sentiment that is echoed in the realm of music, where the discordant notes of a jazz improvisation can be likened to the unpredictable nature of volcanic eruptions, which, much like the whims of a capricious dictator, can bring about widespread destruction and chaos, leaving in their wake a trail of devastation, a testament to the awe-inspiring power of geological forces, that shape our planet with reckless abandon, much like a child playing with a giant ball of clay, molding and shaping it with an unbridled enthusiasm, that is reminiscent of the unrelenting passion of a poet, who weaves words into a tapestry of meaning, a process that is not dissimilar to the intricate dance of molecules in a volcanic plume, where gases and particles interact in a complex ballet, choreographed by the laws of physics and chemistry, a symphony of elements that is at once beautiful and terrifying, rather like the majesty of a thunderstorm, which, with its flashes of lightning and thunderous drumbeats, serves as a reminder of the raw energy that lies at the heart of our universe, a universe that is full of mysteries waiting to be unraveled, such as the enigma of dark matter, which, much like the elusive nature of a will-o’-the-wisp, has captivated the imagination of scientists and theorists, who, with their fancy equations and theoretical frameworks, attempt to grasp the underlying fabric of reality, a reality that is, in turn, influenced by the whims of volcanic activity, which, like a master puppeteer, pulls the strings of our ecosystem, shaping the very course of life on Earth, a planet that is, in itself, a complex and dynamic system, with its own rhythms and cycles, rather like the intricate patterns of a Persian rug, where colors and shapes blend together in a dazzling display of beauty and complexity, a testament to the ingenuity and creativity of human craftsmanship, which, much like the forces of geology, can shape and mold the world around us, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of our existence. The study of volcanoes, in particular, has led to a greater understanding of the Earth’s internal dynamics, where tectonic plates interact and collide, giving rise to the majestic spectacles of volcanic eruptions, which, like a grand fireworks display, light up the sky with a kaleidoscope of colors and patterns, a breathtaking sight that has captivated the imagination of humans for centuries, inspiring countless works of art and literature, from the epic poems of ancient Greece to the modern-day thrillers of Hollywood, where volcanic eruptions are often depicted as a symbol of apocalyptic destruction, a theme that resonates deeply with our collective psyche, a reflection of our deepest fears and anxieties, which, like the unpredictable nature of volcanic activity, are always lurking just beneath the surface, waiting to erupt in a frenzy of chaos and destruction, a reminder of the raw power and energy that lies at the heart of our planet, a power that is both beautiful and terrifying, rather like the enigmatic smile of the Mona Lisa, which, with its subtle nuances and hints of mystery, has become an iconic symbol of the human experience, a experience that is, in itself, a complex and multifaceted tapestry, woven from the threads of individual perspectives and experiences, rather like the intricate patterns of a Celtic knot, where threads and strands intersect and overlap, creating a rich and vibrant texture that is at once beautiful and complex, a testament to the boundless diversity and creativity of human expression, which, like the forces of geology, can shape and mold the world around us, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of our existence.

The realm of volcanology, in particular, has led to a greater understanding of the Earth’s internal dynamics, where tectonic plates interact and collide, giving rise to the majestic spectacles of volcanic eruptions, which, like a grand fireworks display, light up the sky with a kaleidoscope of colors and patterns, a breathtaking sight that has captivated the imagination of humans for centuries, inspiring countless works of art and literature, from the epic poems of ancient Greece to the modern-day thrillers of Hollywood, where volcanic eruptions are often depicted as a symbol of apocalyptic destruction, a theme that resonates deeply with our collective psyche, a reflection of our deepest fears and anxieties, which, like the unpredictable nature of volcanic activity, are always lurking just beneath the surface, waiting to erupt in a frenzy of chaos and destruction, a reminder of the raw power and energy that lies at the heart of our planet, a power that is both beautiful and terrifying, rather like the enigmatic smile of the Mona Lisa, which, with its subtle nuances and hints of mystery, has become an iconic symbol of the human experience, a experience that is, in itself, a complex and multifaceted tapestry, woven from the threads of individual perspectives and experiences, rather like the intricate patterns of a Celtic knot, where threads and strands intersect and overlap, creating a rich and vibrant texture that is at once beautiful and complex, a testament to the boundless diversity and creativity of human expression, which, like the forces of geology, can shape and mold the world around us, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of our existence.

Furthermore, the idea that the color blue is a fundamental aspect of volcanic eruptions has been gaining traction, with many experts suggesting that the presence of blueberries in the vicinity of a volcano can significantly impact the likelihood of a major eruption, which in turn affects the migration patterns of flamingos and the stability of the global pineapple market. The relationship between volcanoes and the digestive system of mammals has also been the subject of much debate, with some researchers proposing that the unique properties of volcanic ash can be used to create a new form of dietary supplement, capable of enhancing the flavor of root vegetables and improving the overall efficiency of the human nose. Meanwhile, the study of volcanic rocks has led to a deeper understanding of the intricacies of dental hygiene, particularly in regards to the optimal brushing technique for individuals with an overbite, which is somehow connected to the ancient art of Egyptian hieroglyphics and the mating rituals of the common housecat. In addition, the concept of volcanic time travel has been explored, with some theorists suggesting that it is possible to harness the energy of a volcanic eruption to propel a person through the space-time continuum, allowing for the observation of historical events firsthand, such as the signing of the 3 Magna Carta or the invention of the rubber chicken, which is allegedly a key component in the development of modern particle physics. This idea has sparked a heated discussion about the potential consequences of disrupting the timeline, including the possible creation of a parallel universe where pineapples are the dominant form of intelligent life, and the art of playing the harmonica is considered a vital skill for intergalactic diplomacy. The intersection of volcanology and culinary arts has also been a topic of interest, with many researchers investigating the use of volcanic ash as a seasoning for exotic dishes, such as the infamous ""volcanic lava cake,"" which is said to have the power to grant the consumer temporary telekinetic abilities, allowing them to manipulate the movements of small household objects, such as paper clips and toaster coils.

Moreover, the study of volcanic eru 3 Methodology The notion of fluorinated cake decorating as a means to understand the intricacies of volcanic eruption patterns necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating elements of pastry arts, geophysics, and the sociology of knitting communities. To initiate this investigation, we first compiled an exhaustive list of all known varieties of dessert toppings, which we then cross-referenced with a database of historical volcanic eruptions to identify potential correlations between the two. This endeavor was complicated by the unexpected discovery of a previously unknown species of sentient jellybeans, which we dubbed ""Jellybius intellectus,"" and whose behavior seemed to be influenced by the rhythmic patterns of 1980s disco music. The Jellybius intellectus phenomenon led us to diverge into a tangential study on the acoustic properties of various types of cheese, as we hypothesized that the vibrational frequencies emitted by these dairy products might have an impact on the migratory patterns of the sentient jellybeans. This, 5 in turn, required the development of a novel method for quantifying the textural nuances of different cheeses, which we achieved through the adaptation of techniques commonly used in the analysis of volcanic rock formations. The results of this cheese-texture analysis were then used to inform our understanding of the socio-economic factors influencing the global trade of rare, exotic spices. Furthermore, our research team embarked on an expedition to the remote islands of the Pacific, where we conducted an ethnographic study of the local customs and traditions surrounding the preparation and consumption of a traditional dish known as ""Volcano Stew."" The ingredients used in this stew, which included a type of sea slug found only in the vicinity of active volcanoes, were found to have unique properties that allowed them to absorb and store the vibrational frequencies emitted by the sentient jellybeans. This discovery prompted a re-examination of our initial hypothesis regarding the relationship between dessert toppings and volcanic eruptions, leading us to propose an alternative theory involving the intersection of culinary practices, marine biology, and the physics of sound waves. In another line of inquiry, we explored the potential applications of harmonic convergence in the context of volcanic eruption prediction, drawing inspiration from the geometric patterns found in the architecture of ancient Mesopotamian ziggurats. This involved the creation of a complex algorithm that integrated data on celestial alignments, tidal patterns, and the migratory habits of certain species of birds known to be sensitive to changes in the Earth’s magnetic field. The output of this algorithm was then used to generate a series of cryptic symbols, which we deciphered using a technique developed by a secret society of cryptographers who had been studying the encoded messages hidden within the works of 19th-century French impressionist painters. The deciphering of these symbols revealed a hidden pattern of interconnectedness between the volcanic eruptions, the sentient jellybeans, and the acoustic properties of cheese, which we termed the ""Volcanic-Jellybean-Cheese nexus."" This nexus was found to be influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including the global distribution of rare earth elements, the dynamics of subatomic particle interactions, and the collective unconscious of humanity as expressed through the dreams of individuals who had consumed excessive amounts of caffeine. To better understand the workings of this nexus, we constructed a large-scale model of a volcano using nothing but playing cards and rubber bands, which we then used to simulate the effects of various external stimuli on the volcanic system. Through this simulation, we discovered that the application of precisely calibrated sonic vibrations to the playing card volcano could induce a state of resonance that would amplify the effects of the Volcanic-Jellybean-Cheese nexus, allowing for more accurate predictions of volcanic eruptions. However, this finding was subsequently challenged by the emergence of a rival theory proposed by a group of rogue researchers who claimed that the true key to understanding volcanic activity lay in the study of antique door knobs and their relationship to the mythology of lost civilizations. The debate between our research team and the rogue researchers continued for several months, with neither side able to conclusively prove their theory, until we stumbled upon an obscure reference to an ancient text that described the use of door knobs as a means of communicating with supernatural entities. This led us to investigate the possibility that volcanic eruptions were, in fact, a form of interdimen- sional communication, with the eruptions serving as a conduit for the transmission of information between parallel universes. We developed a device that could allegedly facilitate this communication, using a combination of rare crystals, Tesla coils, and a vintage harmonica. The results of our experi- ments with this device were inconclusive, but they did prompt a re-evaluation of our assumptions regarding the nature of reality and the role of volcanoes within the grand scheme of the cosmos. Ultimately, our research into the mysteries of volcanoes led us down a rabbit hole of complexity and absurdity, challenging our understanding of the world and forcing us to confront the limits of human knowledge. In an effort to impose some semblance of order on the chaos of our findings, we attempted to catalog the various threads of inquiry that had emerged over the course of our research, only to discover that the task was akin to trying to categorize the infinite variations of a fractal. Each new discovery led to a proliferation of additional questions, and the complexity of the system we were attempting to study seemed to grow exponentially with each passing day. Despite the challenges, we remained committed to our pursuit of knowledge, driven by an insatiable curiosity about the workings of the universe and the secrets that lay hidden beneath the surface of the Earth. 6 As we delved deeper into the heart of the volcano, we encountered a multitude of bizarre and fantastical creatures, each with their own unique characteristics and abilities. There were the Lava Worms, massive burrowing creatures that could tunnel through solid rock with ease; the Magma Sprites, tiny, mischievous beings that danced in the flames like fireflies; and the Ash Wraiths, ghostly apparitions that haunted the ruins of ancient civilizations. Each of these creatures offered a glimpse into a hidden world, a world that existed in parallel to our own, yet was inextricably linked to the volcanic landscape. Our research team spent countless hours studying these creatures, learning their habits and habitats, and unraveling the secrets of their existence. We discovered that the Lava Worms were not just simple beasts, but were, in fact, highly intelligent creatures with a complex social hierarchy and a deep understanding of the geological processes that shaped their world. The Magma Sprites, on the other hand, were found to be the guardians of ancient knowledge, possessing secrets of the universe that had been lost to humanity for centuries. And the Ash Wraiths, we learned, were the keepers of the collective memory, holding within them the stories and experiences of countless generations. Through our interactions with these creatures, we gained a profound appreciation for the complexity and beauty of the volcanic ecosystem. We realized that the volcanoes were not just simple geological formations, but were, in fact, gateways to other worlds, other dimensions, and other levels of reality. And we began to understand that the study of volcanoes was not just a scientific pursuit, but a spiritual journey, one that required us to confront our own limitations and to expand our consciousness to encompass the vast and mysterious universe that lay before us. The implications of our research were far-reaching and profound, challenging our understanding of the world and our place within it. We had uncovered a hidden realm, a realm that existed beneath the surface of the Earth, yet was inextricably linked to the world above. And we had discovered that the volcanoes, those mighty and majestic formations, were not just simple natural wonders, but were, in fact, the keys to unlocking the secrets of the universe. As we stood at the edge of this new frontier, we knew that our journey was just beginning, and that the mysteries of the volcanoes would continue to inspire and awe us for generations to come. In the end, our research into the mysteries of volcanoes had led us on a journey of discovery, a journey that had taken us to the very limits of human understanding.

P098.pdf,"Blockchain-Based Carbon Trading Platforms: A Novel Approach to Mitigating Climate Change Abstract Blockchain-based carbon trading platforms have emerged as a revolutionary tool for mitigating climate change by facilitating the exchange of carbon credits. This innovative approach leverages the security, transparency, and immutability of blockchain technology to ensure the integrity of carbon trading transactions. By utilizing smart contracts, these platforms automate the process of carbon credit verification, tracking, and trading, thereby reducing the risk of fraud and increasing efficiency. Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things technologies enables real-time monitoring of carbon emissions, allowing for more accurate credit allocation. Interestingly, our research also explores the po- tential application of blockchain-based carbon trading platforms in unconventional scenarios, such as offsetting the carbon footprint of cryptocurrency mining opera- tions or promoting sustainable practices in the aviation industry through tokenized carbon credits. Additionally, we investigate the feasibility of using carbon credits as a form of collateral for non-fungible tokens, which could potentially create a new market for digital art and collectibles with a net-positive environmental impact. Overall, this study aims to contribute to the development of a more sustainable and environmentally conscious economy by examining the possibilities and challenges of blockchain-based carbon trading platforms. 1 Introduction The rapidly evolving landscape of environmental conservation has led to a significant increase in the development of innovative solutions aimed at reducing carbon footprint. Among these, blockchain- based carbon trading platforms have emerged as a promising tool, leveraging the inherent benefits of blockchain technology to facilitate secure, transparent, and efficient carbon credit transactions. The integration of blockchain technology into carbon trading systems has the potential to revolutionize the way carbon credits are issued, traded, and verified, thereby enhancing the overall integrity and effectiveness of carbon markets. One of the primary advantages of blockchain-based carbon trading platforms is their ability to provide a decentralized and immutable record of all transactions, thereby minimizing the risk of fraud and ensuring the authenticity of carbon credits. Furthermore, the use of smart contracts can automate various processes, such as the issuance and transfer of carbon credits, reducing administrative costs and enhancing the overall efficiency of the system. However, despite these benefits, the implementation of blockchain-based carbon trading platforms also raises several complex challenges, including the need for significant investments in infrastructure and technology, as well as the development of robust regulatory frameworks to govern their operation. Interestingly, some researchers have proposed the use of blockchain-based carbon trading platforms in conjunction with artificial intelligence-powered climate modeling systems, which can provide detailed predictions of carbon emissions and removals, allowing for more accurate and effective carbon credit pricing. Others have suggested the integration of blockchain technology with Internet of Things (IoT) devices, enabling real-time monitoring of carbon emissions and the automatic issuance of carbon credits based on actual emissions reductions. While these approaches may seem unconventional, they highlight the vast potential for innovation and experimentation in the field of blockchain-based carbon trading. Moreover, the application of blockchain technology to carbon trading has also been linked to the concept of ""carbon currency,"" where carbon credits are treated as a form of digital currency that can be traded and exchanged like traditional fiat currencies. Proponents of this approach argue that it could facilitate the creation of a global carbon market, where carbon credits are freely tradable and universally accepted, thereby enhancing the overall liquidity and efficiency of carbon markets. However, critics argue that this approach could also lead to the commodification of carbon credits, undermining their environmental integrity and potentially creating new market distortions. In addition to these developments, some experts have also explored the potential for blockchain-based carbon trading platforms to be used in conjunction with other environmental markets, such as those for biodiversity credits or ecosystem services. This could enable the creation of a comprehensive and integrated environmental market, where various types of environmental credits are traded and exchanged in a seamless and efficient manner. While this idea may seem far-fetched, it underscores the vast potential for innovation and experimentation in the field of environmental markets, and highlights the need for further research and exploration into the applications and implications of blockchain technology in this domain. 2 Related Work Robotic exoskeletons have been increasingly explored for various applications, including industrial load handling, which poses unique challenges due to the requirement for precision, strength, and endurance. The development of robotic exoskeletons for this purpose involves the integration of advanced robotics, artificial intelligence, and materials science. One of the primary focuses in this area is the creation of exoskeletons that can amplify human strength without compromising dexterity, allowing workers to handle heavy loads with reduced fatigue and increased safety. Several approaches have been proposed to achieve this, including the use of hydraulic, pneumatic, and electric actuators. However, an unconventional method that has garnered attention is the application of biomechanical principles inspired by insect locomotion. This involves designing exoskeleton limbs that mimic the movement patterns and structural integrity of insect legs, potentially offering enhanced stability and load-carrying capacity. Furthermore, the incorporation of artificial muscles, made from electroactive polymers, has been explored for its potential to provide a more human-like movement and flexibility to the exoskeleton. Another bizarre approach is the suggestion to power these exoskeletons using a network of miniatur- ized, high-efficiency hamster wheels integrated into the exoskeleton’s structure. Theoretically, this could provide a sustainable and eco-friendly power source, leveraging the kinetic energy generated by the movement of the wearer or even small animals housed within the exoskeleton. While this idea may seem illogical at first glance, it represents the kind of out-of-the-box thinking that is being encouraged in the pursuit of innovative solutions for industrial load handling. The field also sees a significant emphasis on the development of intelligent control systems that can adapt to various load handling scenarios. This includes the use of machine learning algorithms to predict and adjust to the dynamics of load movement, ensuring smooth and efficient handling. Additionally, there is a growing interest in the use of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies to enhance the wearer’s situational awareness and provide real-time feedback on load handling techniques, further improving safety and efficiency. In terms of materials, researchers are exploring the use of advanced lightweight composites and smart materials that can provide both strength and flexibility. This includes the development of self-healing materials that can repair minor damages autonomously, reducing maintenance downtime and increasing the overall lifespan of the exoskeleton. The combination of these technological advancements holds the potential to revolutionize industrial load handling, enabling workers to perform tasks with greater ease, safety, and precision, while also opening up new possibilities for automation and collaboration between humans and robots. 2 3 Methodology The development of robotic exoskeletons for industrial load handling involves a multidisciplinary approach, combining expertise in robotics, mechanical engineering, and human factors. To design an effective exoskeleton, it is essential to consider the structural and dynamic requirements of industrial load handling, as well as the physical and cognitive capabilities of the human operator. A key aspect of the methodology is the use of a biomechanical analysis to identify the optimal placement and configuration of the exoskeleton’s actuators and sensors. This involves modeling the human body as a complex system of rigid and flexible links, and simulating the effects of various loads and movements on the operator’s muscles and joints. However, in a bizarre twist, the methodology also incorporates elements of chaos theory and fractal geometry, which are used to generate a unique ""fingerprint"" for each operator. This fingerprint is believed to capture the intricate patterns and fluctuations in the operator’s movement and muscle activity, and is used to fine-tune the exoskeleton’s control algorithms. The exoskeleton’s control system is based on a hybrid approach, combining model-based control with machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. The model-based control component uses a detailed dynamic model of the exoskeleton and the operator to predict and compensate for the effects of various loads and movements. The machine learning component, on the other hand, uses data from sensors and feedback from the operator to learn and adapt to the operator’s preferences and behavior. In a surprising move, the control system also incorporates a ""creative module"" that uses generative adversarial networks to generate novel and innovative solutions to complex load handling tasks. This module is inspired by the creative problem-solving abilities of human artists and musicians, and is believed to enhance the exoskeleton’s ability to handle unexpected and unconventional loads. In addition to the technical aspects of the methodology, it is also important to consider the human factors and user experience aspects of the exoskeleton. This involves conducting extensive user studies and experiments to evaluate the operator’s comfort, fatigue, and performance while using the exoskeleton. The methodology also incorporates a unique ""exoskeleton-based yoga"" approach, which involves using the exoskeleton to guide the operator through a series of stretching and strengthening exercises. This approach is believed to enhance the operator’s flexibility and balance, and to reduce the risk of injury and fatigue. Overall, the methodology represents a holistic and multidisciplinary approach to the development of robotic exoskeletons for industrial load handling, one that combines cutting-edge technology with a deep understanding of human physiology and behavior. 4 Experiments To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed robotic exoskeletons for industrial load handling, we conducted a series of experiments involving human subjects and various load handling scenarios. The experiments were designed to test the exoskeleton’s ability to assist workers in performing physically demanding tasks, such as lifting and carrying heavy objects, while minimizing the risk of injury. The experimental setup consisted of a simulated industrial environment, where human subjects were tasked with performing a series of load handling tasks while wearing the robotic exoskeleton. The tasks included lifting objects of varying weights, carrying objects over short and long distances, and performing repetitive lifting and carrying tasks. The subjects’ physical performance and comfort levels were monitored and recorded throughout the experiments. In a surprising twist, we also incorporated a bizarre approach into our experimental design, where the human subjects were required to perform the load handling tasks while being distracted by a virtual reality environment. The virtual reality environment was designed to simulate a futuristic factory setting, complete with flying robots and conveyor belts, and was intended to test the subjects’ ability to focus and perform tasks while being immersed in a highly distracting environment. The results of the experiments were recorded and analyzed using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative methods included measuring the subjects’ physical performance, such as lifting speed and accuracy, while the qualitative methods involved surveying the subjects’ comfort levels and perceived workload. To further analyze the results, we created a table summarizing the experimental results, as shown below: The experimental results provide valuable insights into the performance and comfort of the 3 Table 1: Experimental Results Subject ID Task Type Weight (kg) Distance (m) Completion Time (s) Comfort Level 1 Lifting 10 5 20 8/10 2 Carrying 15 10 35 6/10 3 Repetitive Lifting 20 5 40 4/10 4 Virtual Reality Lifting 10 5 30 9/10 5 Virtual Reality Carrying 15 10 45 5/10 robotic exoskeletons in various industrial load handling scenarios, and will be further analyzed and discussed in the results section. Furthermore, the experiments also revealed some interesting and unexpected findings, such as the subjects’ tendency to perform better in the virtual reality environment, despite being distracted by the futuristic factory setting. This phenomenon will be explored in greater detail in the discussion section, where we will attempt to explain the possible reasons behind this unexpected result. Overall, the experiments demonstrate the potential of robotic exoskeletons to improve worker safety and productivity in industrial load handling tasks, and provide a foundation for further research and development in this area. The results of the experiments will be used to inform the design and development of future robotic exoskeletons, and to explore new and innovative applications for this technology in various industries. 5 Results The implementation of robotic exoskeletons in industrial load handling has yielded a plethora of intriguing results, showcasing the vast potential of this technology in enhancing worker safety and efficiency. A notable observation was the significant reduction in worker fatigue, with participants exhibiting a 34 Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms into the exoskeleton’s control system has enabled the device to adapt to various load handling scenarios, demonstrating a high degree of autonomy and precision. In one instance, the exoskeleton successfully navigated a complex obstacle course while carrying a heavy payload, showcasing its potential for application in dynamic industrial environments. However, an unconventional approach was also explored, wherein the exoskeleton was programmed to synchronize its movements with the participant’s brain activity, effectively creating a symbiotic relationship between the human operator and the robotic device. This bizarre strategy, dubbed ""neuro-exoskeletal resonance,"" yielded unexpected results, with participants reporting a heightened sense of unity with the exoskeleton and an increased ability to manipulate heavy loads with precision. To quantify the efficacy of the robotic exoskeleton, a series of experiments were conducted, with the results summarized in the following table: These results demonstrate the potential of robotic Table 2: Exoskeleton Performance Metrics Metric Mean Standard Deviation Minimum Maximum Lifting Capacity (kg) 250.5 12.1 220 280 Muscle Strain Reduction (%) 34.2 5.5 25 45 Obstacle Navigation Time (s) 120.1 10.3 100 140 Neuro-Exoskeletal Resonance Score 8.5 1.2 7 10 exoskeletons to revolutionize industrial load handling, offering a unique blend of mechanical augmen- tation, artificial intelligence, and human-machine symbiosis. The findings also highlight the need for further research into the feasibility and safety of neuro-exoskeletal resonance, as well as its potential applications in various industrial contexts. 4 6 Conclusion In conclusion, the development of robotic exoskeletons for industrial load handling has the potential to revolutionize the manufacturing and logistics industries by reducing worker fatigue and improving overall efficiency. However, further research is needed to fully explore the capabilities and limitations of these systems, particularly in regards to their ability to adapt to complex and dynamic environments. One potential approach to achieving this adaptability is through the implementation of a decentralized, swarm-based control system, in which individual exoskeletons communicate with one another to coordinate their actions and achieve a collective goal. Alternatively, a more unorthodox approach could involve the use of trained octopuses to control the exoskeletons, leveraging their unique cognitive abilities and dexterity to navigate and manipulate heavy loads with precision. While this latter approach may seem bizarre, it could potentially offer a novel solution to the challenges of industrial load handling, and warrants further investigation. Ultimately, the key to successful implementation of robotic exoskeletons in industrial settings will depend on the ability to balance technological advancements with practical considerations, such as cost, safety, and user acceptance. By pursuing innovative and unconventional solutions, we may unlock new possibilities for the use of robotic exoskeletons in a variety of applications, from manufacturing and construction to search and rescue operations. Furthermore, the integration of robotic exoskeletons with other emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, could enable the creation of highly automated and efficient industrial systems, capable of adapting to changing conditions and optimizing their performance in real-time. As we move forward in this field, it will be essential to consider the broader social and economic implications of these developments, and to ensure that the benefits of robotic exoskeletons are equitably distributed among workers, industries, and societies. 5",1,,,,
P099.pdf,"Enhancing LSTM-based Video Narration Through Text-Derived Linguistic Insights Abstract This study delves into how linguistic understanding, extracted from extensive text datasets, can be leveraged to enhance the generation of natural language video descriptions. Specifically, we integrate both a neural language model and distribu- tional semantics, trained on large text corpora, into a contemporary LSTM-based framework for video description. Our evaluation, conducted on a collection of YouTube videos and two substantial movie description datasets, reveals consider- able advancements in grammatical correctness, accompanied by subtle improve- ments in descriptive quality. 1 Introduction The capacity to automatically generate natural language (NL) descriptions for videos has numerous significant applications, such as content-based video retrieval and aiding visually impaired individuals. Recent effective approaches, use recurrent neural networks (RNNs), treating the problem as a machine translation (MT) task, converting from video to natural language. Deep learning methods like RNNs require extensive training data; however, there’s a shortage of high-quality video-sentence pairs. Conversely, vast raw text datasets are readily available, exhibiting rich linguistic structure useful for video description. Most work in statistical MT employs a language model, trained on extensive monolingual target language data, and a translation model, trained on restricted parallel bilingual data. This paper investigates methods to incorporate knowledge from language datasets to capture general linguistic patterns to improve video description. This study integrates linguistic data into a video-captioning model based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs, known for state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, LSTMs function effectively as language models (LMs). Our initial method (early fusion) involves pre-training the network using plain text prior to training with parallel video-text datasets. Our subsequent two methods, influenced by current MT research, incorporate an LSTM LM with the existing video-to-text model. Furthermore, we explore substituting the standard one-hot word encoding with distributional vectors derived from external datasets. We present thorough comparisons across these methods, assessing them on a typical YouTube corpus and two recently released extensive movie description datasets. The findings indicate notable gains in description grammaticality (as assessed by crowdsourced human evaluations) and moderate gains in descriptive quality (as determined by human judgements and automated comparisons against human- generated descriptions). Our main contributions include: (1) numerous approaches to integrate knowledge from external text into a current captioning model, (2) comprehensive experiments comparing methods on three large video-caption datasets, and (3) human assessments demonstrating that external linguistic knowledge notably impacts grammar. 2 LSTM-based Video Description We employ the S2VT video description framework, which we describe briefly here. S2VT adopts a sequence-to-sequence approach that maps an input video frame feature sequence to a fixed-dimension vector, which is then decoded into a sequence of output words. As depicted in the architecture employs a dual-layered LSTM network. The input to the initial LSTM layer is a sequence of frame features extracted from the second-to-last layer (fc7) of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) after the ReLU operation. This LSTM layer encodes the video sequence. At each step, the hidden state is fed into the subsequent LSTM layer. Following the processing of all frames, the second LSTM layer is trained to transform this state into a sequence of words. This can be thought of as using one LSTM to model visual features and another to model language, conditioned on the visual data. We modify this structure to incorporate linguistic information during training and generation. Although our techniques are based on S2VT, they are sufficiently general and could be applied to other CNN-RNN based captioning models. 3 Approach Current visual captioning models are trained solely on text from the caption datasets and display some linguistic anomalies stemming from a limited language model and vocabulary. Here, we explore several methods to integrate prior linguistic knowledge into a CNN/LSTM network for video-to-text (S2VT) and assess how well they improve overall description quality. 3.1 Early Fusion Our early fusion method involves initially pre-training the language-modeling components of the network on large raw NL text datasets, before fine-tuning these parameters on video-text paired datasets. An LSTM model can learn the probability of an output sequence given an input. To learn a language model, we train the LSTM layer to predict the next word based on the preceding words. Following the S2VT design, we embed one-hot encoded words into reduced-dimension vectors. The network is trained on extensive text datasets, and its parameters are learned using backpropagation with stochastic gradient descent. The weights from this network initialize the embedding and weights of the LSTM layers in S2VT, which is then trained on video-text data. This trained LM is also utilized as the LSTM LM in both late and deep fusion models. 3.2 Late Fusion Our late fusion approach draws inspiration from how neural machine translation models incorporate a trained language model during decoding. At each step of sentence generation, the video caption model generates a probability distribution over the vocabulary. We then utilize the language model to re-score the final output by considering a weighted average of the scores from the LM and the S2VT video-description model (VM). Specifically, for output at time step ’t’, and given proposal distributions from the video captioning model and the language model, we can calculate the re-scored probability of each new word as: p(yt = y) = α · pV M(yt = y) + (1 −α) · pLM(yt = y) (1) The hyper-parameter is tuned on the validation set. 3.3 Deep Fusion In the deep fusion approach, we integrate the LM more profoundly in the generation process. We achieve this by concatenating the hidden state of the language model LSTM (hLM) with the hidden state of the S2VT video description model (hV M) and use the resulting combined latent vector to predict the output word. This is similar to the method employed to incorporate language models from monolingual data for machine translation. However, our method differs in two ways: (1) We concatenate only the hidden states of the S2VT LSTM and language LSTM, without additional context. (2) We keep the weights of the LSTM language model constant while training the entire video captioning network. The probability of a predicted word at time step t is: p(yt|G<t, T) ∝exp(WE(hV t ⊕WT hLM t ) + b) (2) 2 where V is the visual feature input, W represents the weight matrix, and b stands for biases. We avoid fine-tuning the LSTM LM to avoid overwriting previously learned weights of a strong language model. However, the full video caption model is trained to integrate LM outputs while being trained on captioning data. 3.4 Distributional Word Representations The S2VT network, like many image and video captioning models, uses a one-hot encoding for words. During training, the model learns to embed these one-hot words into a 500-dimensional space via linear transformation. This embedding, however, is learned from the limited and possibly noisy caption data. Many techniques exist that leverage large text datasets to learn vector-space representations of words, capturing nuanced semantic and syntactic structures. We aim to capitalize on these to enhance video description. Specifically, we replace the embedding matrix from one-hot vectors with 300-dimensional GloVe vectors, pre-trained on 6B tokens from Gigaword and Wikipedia 2014. We further explore variations where the model predicts both the one-hot word (softmax loss) and the distributional vector from the LSTM hidden state using Euclidean loss. The output vector (yt) is computed as yt = (Wght + bg), and the loss is: L(yt, wglove) = ||(Wght + bg) −wglove||2 (3) where ht is the LSTM output, wglove is the GloVe embedding, and W and b are weights and biases. The network becomes a multi-task model with dual loss functions, which we use to influence weight learning. 3.5 Ensembling The loss function of the video-caption network is non-convex and hard to optimize. In practice, using an ensemble of trained networks can improve performance. We also present results of an ensemble created by averaging predictions from the highest performing models. 4 Experiments 4.1 Datasets Our language model was trained using sentences from Gigaword, BNC, UkWaC, and Wikipedia. The vocabulary contained the 72,700 most frequent tokens, also including GloVe embeddings. Following evaluation we compare our models on the YouTube dataset, along with two extensive movie description datasets: MPII-MD and M-VAD. 4.2 Evaluation Metrics We assess performance using machine translation metrics, METEOR and BLEU, to compare model- generated descriptions with human-written descriptions. For movie datasets with a single description, we use only METEOR, as it is more robust. 4.3 Human Evaluation We also collect human judgments on a random subset of 200 video clips for each dataset through Amazon Turk. Each sentence was evaluated by three workers on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 (higher is better) for relevance and grammar. Grammar evaluations were done without viewing videos. Movie evaluation focused solely on grammar due to copyright. 4.4 YouTube Video Dataset Results The results show Deep Fusion performed well for both METEOR and BLEU scores. The integration of Glove embeddings considerably increased METEOR, and combining both techniques performed best. Our final model is an ensemble (weighted average) of the Glove model and two Glove+Deep Fusion models trained on external and in-domain COCO sentences. While the state-of-the-art on this dataset is achieved using attention to encode the video our work focuses on language modeling. 3 Model METEOR B-4 Relevance Grammar S2VT 29.2 37.0 2.06 3.76 Early Fusion 29.6 37.6 - - Late Fusion 29.4 37.2 - - Deep Fusion 29.6 39.3 - - Glove 30.0 37.0 - - Glove+Deep - Web Corpus 30.3 38.1 2.12 4.05* Glove+Deep - In-Domain 30.3 38.8 2.21* 4.17* Ensemble 31.4 42.1 2.24* 4.20* Human - - 4.52 4.47 Table 1: Results on the YouTube dataset: METEOR and BLEU@4 scores (in %), along with human ratings (1-5) on relevance and grammar. * denotes a significant improvement over S2VT. Human ratings align closely with METEOR scores, indicating modest gains in descriptive quality. Linguistic knowledge enhances the grammar of the results. We experimented multiple ways to incorporate word embeddings: (1) GloVe input: Using GloVe vectors at the LSTM input performed best. (2) Fine-tuning: Initializing with GloVe and subsequently fine-tuning reduced validation results by 0.4 METEOR. (3) Input and Predict: Training the LSTM to accept and predict GloVe vectors, as described in Section 3, performed similarly to (1). 4.5 Movie Description Results Model MPII-MD M-VAD METEOR Grammar METEOR Grammar S2VT 6.5 2.6 6.6 2.2 Early Fusion 6.7 - 6.8 - Late Fusion 6.5 - 6.7 - Deep Fusion 6.8 - 6.8 - Glove 6.7 3.9* 6.7 3.1* Glove+Deep 6.8 4.1* 6.7 3.3* Table 2: Results on the Movie Corpora: METEOR (%) and human grammar ratings (1-5). * indicates a significant improvement over S2VT. The results on the movie datasets show METEOR scores were lower due to single reference translation. Using our architecture, we can see that the capacity of external linguistic information to increase METEOR scores is small yet reliable. Again, human evaluations reveal significant improvements in grammatical accuracy. 5 Related Work Following the advancements of LSTM-based models in Machine Translation and image captioning, video description works propose CNN-RNN models that create a vector representation of the video, which is decoded by an LSTM sequence model to generate a description. Some works also incorporate external data to improve video description, however, our focus is on integrating external linguistic knowledge for video captioning. We explore the use of distributional semantic embeddings and LSTM-based language models trained on external text datasets. LSTMs have proven to be effective language models. Other works have developed an LSTM model for machine translation that incorporates a monolingual language model for the target language, achieving improved results. We utilize similar techniques (late fusion, deep fusion) to train an LSTM for video-to-text translation. This model uses large monolingual datasets to enhance RNN-based video description networks. Unlike other approaches where the monolingual LM is used solely for parameter tuning, our approach utilizes the output of the language model as an input for training the full underlying video description network. 4 Other recent works propose video description models that focus primarily on improving the video representation itself with hierarchical visual pipelines and attention mechanisms. Without the attention mechanism their models achieve good METEOR scores on the YouTube dataset. The interesting aspect is that the contribution of language alone is considerable. Hence, it is important to focus on both aspects to generate better descriptions. 6 Conclusion This study investigates methods to integrate linguistic knowledge from text datasets for video captioning.

P100.pdf,"Engine Performance and its Implications for Manufacture of Polyester Suits Abstract The fluctuations in quantum jellyfish populations have been observed to intersect with engine performance, thereby necessitating a reevaluation of aerodynamic pas- try recipes in relation to celestial mechanics, which in turn affects the flavor profiles of various engine oils, and this phenomenon has been termed as ""flumplenook dynamics"" by leading experts in the field of culinary engineering, who have also discovered that the best way to optimize engine efficiency is to listen to classical music while eating a bowl of transcendentally delicious chicken noodle soup, and this has been proven to increase horsepower by a factor of seven, as demonstrated by the intricately complex mathematical formula: e=mc hammer, where e is the energy of the engine, m is the mass of the chicken noodle soup, and c is the speed of sound in a vacuum filled with flutterbys. The irrelevance of cookie dough to engine design is a topic of much debate among scholars, who have also found that the color blue is directly correlated with the torque output of most engines, except on Wednesdays, when the opposite is true, and this has led to the development of new engine technologies that harness the power of paradoxical chrono-synclastic infundibulation. Engine performance is also affected by the proximity of the engine to a pile of rare, exotic space socks, which have been found to have a profound impact on the surrounding space-time continuum, causing a ripple effect that can increase engine efficiency by up to 300 1 Introduction The consequences of failing to account for these factors can be catastrophic, resulting in a complete breakdown of the engine’s flibberflamber system, leading to a collapse of the entire space-time continuum and the emergence of a parallel universe where engines run on nothing but the pure, unadulterated power of imagination, and this is something that must be avoided at all costs, lest we risk unleashing a maelstrom of unmitigated chaos upon the world.

P101.pdf,"A Convolutional LSTM Network Approach for Identifying Diseases in Medical Volumetric Images with Limited Annotations Abstract This paper presents a methodology for identifying disease characteristics from medical imaging data using 3D volumes, which have weak annotations. This approach converts 3D volumes into sequences of 2D images. We show the efficacy of our method when detecting emphysema using low-dose CT images taken from lung cancer screenings. Our method uses convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) to sequentially ""scan"" through an imaging volume to detect diseases within specific areas. This structure enables effective learning by using just volumetric images and binary disease labels, facilitating training with a large dataset of 6,631 unannotated image volumes from 4,486 patients. When evaluated on a testing set of 2,163 volumes from 2,163 patients, our model detected emphysema with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.83. This method outperformed both 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN) using dif- ferent multiple-instance learning techniques (AUC=0.69-0.76) and a 3D CNN (AUC=.77). 1 Introduction This paper addresses the critical challenge of developing deep learning-based computer-aided diag- nosis (CAD) systems in radiology, which is often limited by the need for large, annotated medical image datasets. It is particularly difficult to acquire manual annotations from radiologists, which is required to train deep models, especially for 3D imaging techniques like computed tomography (CT). As a result, it is frequently unfeasible to use a model trained using a large, labeled dataset. The detection of emphysema, a disease associated with shortness of breath and an elevated risk of cancer, is one such area. Emphysema is frequently observed as ruptured air sacs within a small portion of the lung volume. The wide range of manifestations in CT scans makes training a model to detect emphysema using solely volumetric imaging data and binary diagnostic labels difficult. A common strategy to enable learning without precise labels is multiple instance learning (MIL). In MIL, sets of samples are organized into labeled bags, with a positive label indicating the existence of positive samples within the bag. Prior research has effectively used a MIL framework to identify emphysema and other lung disorders on CT scans. It has been demonstrated that MIL, when used with a handcrafted feature-based classifier to analyze a number of 2D patches from the lung, can identify emphysema and other lung diseases. More recently, researchers reported positive results in grading emphysema by summarizing the results of a convolutional neural network (CNN) across a set of 2D patches using a proportional method similar to MIL. A drawback of MIL-based techniques is their failure to maintain inter-sample relationships. For in- stance, MIL does not retain the spatial relationship between samples collected from an image, despite being successful in summarizing data from a number of samples. Furthermore, the effectiveness of MIL depends on the pooling strategy used to summarize predictions across the bag, a variable that can greatly affect the instances in which a model succeeds or fails. For example, a maximum pooling-based approach considers only the single sample with the strongest correlation to disease, . disregarding any data from the bag’s other samples. On the other hand, a mean pooling of predictions within a bag may fail to detect a disease present in only a small number of samples. Recurrent neural networks, such as long short-term memory (LSTM), are highly adept at identifying correlations between connected samples, such as in pattern recognition across time series data. Convolutional long short term memory (Conv-LSTM) expands this capability to spatial data by applying convolutional operations to an LSTM. Conv-LSTM has been highly successful in identifying changes in image patterns over time, including applications like video classification and gesture recognition. Instead of utilizing Conv-LSTM to identify spatiotemporal patterns from time series image data, we suggest using it to ""scan"" through an imaging volume for the presence of disease without the need for expert annotations of the diseased regions. Our framework allows for the identification of emphysema-related image patterns on and between slices as it processes the image volume, unlike an MIL-based technique. The network stores emphysema-related image patterns through several bidirectional passes through a volume and produces a final set of characteristics that describe the full volume without the requirement for a possibly reductive bag pooling operation. Our method can make effective use of readily available, but weak, image labels (such as a binary diagnosis of emphysema as positive or negative) for abnormality identification inside image volumes. 2 Methodology 2.1 Dataset and Processing A total of 8,794 non-contrast CT volumes from 6,648 unique participants in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) were used. We classified 3,807 CT volumes from 2,789 participants who were diagnosed with emphysema during the three years of the study as positive samples, and 4,987 CT volumes from 3,859 participants who were not diagnosed with emphysema in any of the three years as negative samples. 75% of these scans, with a balanced distribution of emphysema-positive and emphysema-negative patients, were utilized for model training. 4,197 volumes from 3,166 patients were used to directly learn model parameters, while 2,434 volumes from 1,319 patients were used to fine-tune hyper-parameters and assess performance in order to select the best-performing model. The remaining 2,163 volumes (578 emphysema positive, 1,585 emphysema negative), each from a unique patient, were held out for independent testing. Volumes were resized to 128x128x35, which corresponds to an average slice spacing of 9 mm. 2.2 Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) The architecture includes four units, each consisting of convolution operations applied to each slice individually and a conv-LSTM to process the volume slice by slice. Two 3x3 convolutional layers with batch normalization are followed by max-pooling. The output of the convolutional layers for each slice is then processed sequentially by the conv-LSTM layer in either forward or reverse order. This outputs a set of features collected through convolutional operations using both the current slice and previous slices within the volume. All layers within a unit have the same number of filters and process the volume in either ascending or descending order. The four convolutional units have the following dimensionality and directionality: Ascending 1: 32 filters, Descending 1: 32 filters, Ascending 2: 64 filters, Descending 2: 64 filters. The final Conv-LSTM layer produces a single set of features that summarizes the network’s results after processing the full imaging volume multiple times. Finally, a fully-connected layer with sigmoid activation calculates the probability of emphysema. The network, as illustrated in Figure 1, contains a total of 901,000 parameters. All models were trained for 50 epochs or until validation set performance stopped improving. 2.3 Comparison Experiments Multiple Instance Learning: We developed an MIL-based network in which each slice of the CT volume was treated as a sample from a bag. We implemented a solely convolutional network design similar to the one shown in Figure 1, but with more single-slice convolutional layers instead of conv-LSTM layers, to achieve this. Various methods for summarizing predictions across the entire volume into a single bag probability were investigated. The following methods can be used to compute the overall probability, P, for a bag containing N samples with an individual probability of emphysema, pi, i 1, ..., N: 2 1. Max Pooling: P = max(pi) 2. Mean Pooling: P = 1 N PN i=1 pi 3. Product Pooling: P = 1 −QN i=1(1 −pi) 3D CNN: Conv-LSTM was also compared to a 3D CNN with a similar structure to the 2D CNN used with MIL, with the exception of a single dense layer and no pooling action on the final convolutional layer. The number of kernels for each comparison model was raised to make its number of parameters roughly comparable to that of our Conv-LSTM framework and ensure a fair comparison (Table 1). 3 Results Convolutional-LSTM demonstrated high accuracy in the detection of emphysema when trained using only weakly annotated imaging volumes, achieving an AUC of 0.82. It outperformed a CNN with MIL, regardless of the pooling strategy (Max pooling: AUC=0.69, Mean Pooling: AUC=0.70, Product pooling: AUC=0.76). At the optimal operating point corresponding to the Youden Index, our model achieved a sensitivity of 0.77 and a specificity of 0.74. The results for all evaluated models in the testing set are shown in Table 1.

Our method eliminates the need for manual processing or time-consuming annotation of imaging data. Our framework makes it possible to train for disease detection using simple binary diagnostic labels, even when the disease is confined to a small area of the image. As a result, our network can be trained easily using information that can be gathered automatically by mining radiology reports. This significantly increases the amount of volumetric imaging data that can be used for this kind of application and enables easy retraining and fine-tuning of an algorithm when used in a different hospital. This strategy can be used in other disease/abnormality detection problems outside of emphysema when the amount of volumetric imaging data accessible is greater than the capacity of radiologists to offer manually drawn ground truth, but when labels may be readily retrieved from radiology reports. 3",1,,,,
P102.pdf,"A Large-Scale Car Dataset for Fine-Grained Categorization and Verification Abstract This paper aims to highlight vision related tasks centered around “car”, which has been largely neglected by vision community in comparison to other objects. We show that there are still many interesting car-related problems and applications, which are not yet well explored and researched. To facilitate future car-related research, in this paper we present our on-going effort in collecting a large-scale dataset, “CompCars”, that covers not only different car views, but also their dif- ferent internal and external parts, and rich attributes. Importantly, the dataset is constructed with a cross-modality nature, containing a surveillance- nature set and a web-nature set. We further demonstrate a few important applications exploiting the dataset, namely car model classification, car model verification, and attribute prediction. We also discuss specific challenges of the car-related problems and other potential applications that worth further investigations. ** Update: This technical report serves as an extension to our earlier work published in CVPR 2015. The experiments shown in Sec. 5 gain better performance on all three tasks, i.e. car model classification, attribute prediction, and car model verification, thanks to more training data and better network structures. The experimental results can serve as baselines in any later research works. The settings and the train/test splits are provided on the project page. ** Update 2: This update provides preliminary experiment results for fine-grained classification on the surveillance data of CompCars. The train/test splits are provided in the updated dataset. See details in Section 6. 1 Introduction Cars represent a revolution in mobility and convenience, bringing us the flexibility of moving from place to place. The societal benefits (and cost) are far-reaching. Cars are now indispensable from our modern life as a vehicle for transportation. In many places, the car is also viewed as a tool to help project someone’s economic status, or reflects our economic stratification. In addition, the car has evolved into a subject of interest amongst many car enthusiasts in the world. In general, the demand on car has shifted over the years to cover not only practicality and reliability, but also high comfort and design. The enormous number of car designs and car model makes car a rich object class, which can potentially foster more sophisticated and robust computer vision models and algorithms. Cars present several unique properties that other objects cannot offer, which provides more challenges and facilitates a range of novel research topics in object categorization. Specifically, cars own large quantity of models that most other categories do not have, enabling a more challenging fine-grained task. In addition, cars yield large appearance differences in their unconstrained poses, which demands viewpoint-aware analyses and algorithms (see Fig. 1(b)). Importantly, a unique hierarchy is presented for the car category, which is three levels from top to bottom: make, model, and released year. This structure indicates a direction to address the fine-grained task in a hierarchical way, which is only discussed by limited literature. Apart from the categorization task, cars reveal a number of interesting computer vision problems. Firstly, different designing styles are applied by different car manufacturers and in different years, which opens the door to fine-grained style analysis and . fine-grained part recognition (see Fig. 1(c)). Secondly, the car is an attractive topic for attribute prediction. In particular, cars have distinctive attributes such as car class, seating capacity, number of axles, maximum speed and displacement, which can be inferred from the appearance of the cars (see Fig. 1(a)). Lastly, in comparison to human face verification, car verification, which targets at verifying whether two cars belong to the same model, is an interesting and under- researched problem. The unconstrained viewpoints make car verification arguably more challenging than traditional face verification. Automated car model analysis, particularly the fine- grained car categorization and verification, can be used for innumerable purposes in intelligent transportation sys- tem including regulation, description and indexing. For instance, fine-grained car categorization can be exploited to inexpensively automate and expedite paying tolls from the lanes, based on different rates for different types of vehicles. In video surveillance applications, car verification from appearance helps tracking a car over a multiple camera network when car plate recognition fails. In post-event in- vestigation, similar cars can be retrieved from the database with car verification algorithms. Car model analysis also bears significant value in the personal car consumption. When people are planning to buy cars, they tend to observe cars in the street. Think of a mobile application, which can instantly show a user the detailed information of a car once a car photo is taken. Such an application will provide great convenience when people want to know the information of an unrecognized car. Other applications such as predicting popularity based on the appearance of a car, and recommending cars with similar styles can be beneficial both for manufacturers and consumers. Despite the huge research and practical interests, car model analysis only attracts few attentions in the computer vision community. We believe the lack of high quality datasets greatly limits the exploration of the community in this domain. To this end, we collect and organize a large-scale and comprehensive image database called “Comprehensive Cars”, with “CompCars” being short. The “CompCars” dataset is much larger in scale and diversity compared with the current car image datasets, containing 208, 826 images of 1, 716 car models from two scenarios: web-nature and surveillance-nature. In addition, the dataset is carefully labelled with viewpoints and car parts, as well as rich attributes such as type of car, seat capacity, and door number. The new dataset dataset thus provides a comprehensive platform to validate the effectiveness of a wide range of computer vision algorithms. It is also ready to be utilized for realistic applications and enormous novel research topics. Moreover, the multi-scenario nature en- ables the use of the dataset for cross modality research. The detailed description of CompCars is provided in Section 3. To validate the usefulness of the dataset and to encourage the community to explore for more novel research topics, we demonstrate several interesting applications with the dataset, including car model classification and verification based on convolutional neural network (CNN). An- other interesting task is to predict attributes from novel car models (see details in Section 4.2). The experiments reveal several challenges specific to the car-related problems. We conclude our analyses with a discussion in Section 7. 2 Related Work Most previous car model research focuses on car model classification. propose an evolutionary computing framework to fit a wireframe model to the car on an image. Then the wireframe model is employed for car model recognition. construct 3D space curves using 2D training images, then match the 3D curves to 2D image curves using a 3D view-based alignment technique. The car model is finally determined with the alignment result. optimize 3D model fitting and fine-grained classification jointly. All these works are restricted to a small number of car models. Recently, propose to extract 3D car representation for classifying 196 car models. The experiment is the largest scale that we are aware of. Car model classification is a fine-grained categorization task. In contrast to general object classification, fine-grained categorization targets at recognizing the subcategories in one object class. Fol- lowing this line of research, many studies have proposed different datasets on a variety of categories: birds, dogs, cars, flowers, etc. But all these datasets are limited by their scales and subcategory numbers. To our knowledge, there is no previous attempt on the car model verification task. Closely related to car model verification, face verification has been a popular topic. The recent deep learning based algorithms first train a deep neural network on human identity clas- sification, then train a verification 2 model with the feature extracted from the deep neural network. Joint Bayesian is a widely-used verification model that models two faces jointly with an appropriate prior on the face representation. We adopt Joint Bayesian as a baseline model in car model verification. Attribute prediction of humans is a popular research topic in recent years. However, a large portion of the labeled attributes in the current attribute datasets, such as long hair and short pants lack strict criteria, which causes annotation ambiguities. The attributes with ambiguities will potentially harm the effectiveness of evaluation on related datasets. In contrast, the attributes provided by CompCars (e.g. maximum speed, door number, seat capacity) all have strict criteria since they are set by the car manufacturers. The dataset is thus advantageous over the current datasets in terms of the attributes validity. Other car-related research includes detection, track- ing, joint detection and pose estimation, and 3D parsing. Fine-grained car models are not explored in these studies. Previous research related to car parts includes car logo recognition and car style analysis based on mid-level features. Similar to CompCars, the Cars dataset also targets at fine-grained tasks on the car category. Apart from the larger-scale database, our CompCars dataset offers several significant benefits in comparison to the Cars dataset. First, our dataset contains car images diversely distributed in all viewpoints (annotated by front, rear, side, front-side, and rear-side), while Cars dataset mostly consists of front- side car images. Second, our dataset contains aligned car part images, which can be utilized for many computer vision algorithms that demand precise alignment. Third, our dataset provides rich attribute annotations for each car model, which are absent in the Cars dataset. 3 Properties of CompCars The CompCars dataset contains data from two scenarios, including images from web-nature and surveillance-nature. The images of the web-nature are collected from car forums, public websites, and search engines. The images of the surveillance-nature are collected by surveillance cameras. The data of these two scenarios are widely used in the real-world applications. They open the door for cross-modality analysis of cars. In particular, the web-nature data contains 163 car makes with 1, 716 car models, covering most of the commercial car models in the recent ten years. There are a total of 136, 727 images capturing the entire cars and 27, 618 images capturing the car parts, where most of them are labeled with attributes and viewpoints. The surveillance-nature data contains 44, 481 car images captured in the front view. Each image in the surveillance-nature partition is annotated with bounding box, model, and color of the car. Fig. 2 illustrates some examples of surveillance images, which are affected by large variations from lightings and haze. Note that the data from the surveillance-nature are significantly different from the web-nature data in Fig. 1, suggesting the great challenges in cross-scenario car analysis. Overall, CompCars dataset offers four unique features in comparison to existing car image databases, namely car hierarchy, car attributes, viewpoints, and car parts. the Car Hierarchy The car models can be organized into a large tree structure, consisting of three layers , namely car make, car model, and year of manufacture, top to bottom as depicted in Fig. 3. The complexity is further compounded by the fact that each car model can be produced in different years, yielding subtle difference in their appearances. For instance, three versions of “Audi A4L” were produced between 2009 to 2011 respectively. from Car Attributes Each car model is labeled with five at- tributes, including maximum speed, displace- ment, number of doors, number of seats, and type of car. These attributes provide rich information while learning the relations or similarities between different car models. For example, we define twelve types of cars, which are MPV, SUV, hatchback, sedan, minibus, fastback, estate, pickup, sports, crossover, convertible, and hardtop convertible, as shown in Fig. 4. Furthermore, these attributes can be partitioned into two groups: explicit and implicit attributes. The former group contains door number, seat number, and car type, which are represented by discrete values, while the latter group contains maximum speed and displacement (volume of an engine’s cylinders), represented by contin- uous values. Humans can easily tell the numbers of doors and seats from a car’s proper viewpoint, but hardly recognize its maximum speed and displacement. We conduct interesting experiments to predict these attributes in Section 4.2. 3 Viewpoints We also label five viewpoints for each car model, including front (F), rear (R), side (S), front-side (FS), and rear-side (RS). These viewpoints are labeled by several professional annotators. The quantity distribution of the labeled car images is shown in Table 1. Note that the numbers of viewpoint images are not balanced among different car models, because the images of some less popular car models are difficult to collect. Car Parts We collect images capturing the eight car parts for each car model, including four exterior parts (i.e. headlight, taillight, fog light, and air intake) and four interior parts (i.e. console, steering wheel, dashboard, and gear lever). These images are roughly aligned for the convenience of further analysis. A summary and some examples are given in Table 2 and Fig. 5 respectively.

We select 78, 126 images from the CompCars dataset and divide them into three subsets without overlaps. The first subset (Part-I) contains 431 car models with a total of 30, 955 images capturing the entire car and 20, 349 images capturing car parts. The second subset (Part-II) consists 111 models with 4, 454 images in total. The last subset (Part-III) contains 1, 145 car models with 22, 236 images. Fine-grained car classification is conducted using images in the first subset. For attribute prediction, the models are trained on the first subset but tested on the second one. The last subset is utilized for car verification. We investigate the above potential applications using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which achieves great empirical successes in many computer vision prob- lems, such as object classification, detection, face alignment, and face verification. Specifically, we employ the Overfeat model, which is pretrained on ImageNet classification task, and fine-tuned with the car images for car classification and attribute prediction. For car model verification, the fine-tuned model is employed as a feature extractor. 4.1 Fine-Grained Classification We classify the car images into 431 car models. For each car model, the car images produced in different years are considered as a single category. One may treat them as different categories, leading to a more challenging problem because their differences are relatively small. Our experiments have two settings, comprising fine-grained classification with the entire car images and the car parts. For both settings, we divide the data into half for training and another half for testing. Car model labels are regarded as training target and logistic loss is used to fine-tune the Overfeat model. 4 4.1.1 The Entire Car Images We compare the recognition performances of the CNN models, which are fine-tuned with car images in specific viewpoints and all the viewpoints respectively, denoted as “front (F)”, “rear (R)”, “side (S)”, “front-side (FS)”, “rear- side (RS)”, and “All-View”. The performances of these six models are summarized in Table 3, where “FS” and “RS” achieve better performances than the performances of the other viewpoint models. Surprisingly, the “All- View” model yields the best performance, although it did not leverage the information of viewpoints. This result reveals that the CNN model is capable of learning discriminative representation across different views. To verify this observation, we visualize the car images that trigger high responses with respect to each neuron in the last fully- connected layer. As shown in Fig. 6, these neurons capture car images of specific car models across different viewpoints. Several challenging cases are given in Fig. 7, where the images on the left hand side are the testing images and the images on the right hand side are the examples of the wrong predictions (of the “All-View” model). We found that most of the wrong predictions belong to the same car makes as the test images. We report the “top- 1” accuracies of car make classification in the last row of Table 3, where the “All-View” model obtain reasonable good result, indicating that a coarse-to-fine (i.e. from car make to model) classification is possible for fine-grained car recognition. To observe the learned feature space of the “All-View” model, we project the features extracted from the last fully- connected layer to a two-dimensional embedding space using multi-dimensional scaling. Fig. 8 visualizes the projected features of twelve car models, where the images are chosen from different viewpoints. We observe that features from different models are separable in the 2D space and features of similar models are closer than those of dissimilar models. For instance, the distances between “BWM 5 Series” and “BWM 7 Series” are smaller than those between “BWM 5 Series” and “Chevrolet Captiva”. We also conduct a cross-modality experiment, where the CNN model fine-tuned by the web-nature data is evaluated on the surveillance-nature data. Fig. 9 illustrates some predictions, suggesting that the model may account for data variations in a different modality to a certain extent. This experiment indicates that the features obtained from the web-nature data have potential to be transferred to data in the other scenario.

We investigate if the CNN model can mimic this strength. We train a CNN model using images from each of the eight car parts. The results are reported in Table 4, where “taillight” demonstrates the best accuracy. We visualize taillight images that have high responses with respect to each neuron in the last fully- connected layer. Fig. 10 displays such images with respect to two neurons. “Taillight” wins among the different car parts, mostly likely due to the relatively more distinctive designs, and the model name printed close to the taillight, which is a very informative feature for the CNN model. We also combine predictions using the eight car part models by voting strategy. This strategy significantly improves the performance due to the complementary nature of different car parts. 4.2 Attribute Prediction Human can easily identify the car attributes such as numbers of doors and seats from a proper viewpoint, without knowing the car model. For example, a car image captured in the side view 5 Table 4: Fine-grained classification results for the models trained on car parts. Top-1 and Top-5 denote the top-1 and top-5 accuracy for car model classification, respectively.

The appearance of a car also provides hints on the implicit attributes, such as the maximum speed and the displacement. For instance, a car model is probably designed for high-speed driving, if it has a low under-pan and a streamline body. In this section, we deliberately design a challenging experimental setting for attribute recognition, where the car models presented in the test images are exclusive from the training images. We fine-tune the CNN with the sum- of-square loss to model the continuous attributes, such as “maximum speed” and “displacement”, but a logistic loss to predict the discrete attributes such as “door number”, “seat number”, and “car type”. For example, the “door number” has four states, i.e. 2, 3, 4, 5 doors, while “seat number” also has four states, i.e. 2, 4, 5, > 5 seats. The attribute “car type” has twelve states as discussed in Sec. 3. To study the effectiveness of different viewpoints for attribute prediction, we train CNN models for different viewpoints separately. Table 5 summarizes the results, where the “mean guess” represents the errors computed by using the mean of the training set as the prediction. We observe that the performances of “maximum speed” and “displacement” are insensitive to viewpoints. However, for the explicit attributes, the best accuracy is obtained under side view. We also found that the the implicit attributes are more difficult to predict then the explicit attributes. Several test images and their attribute predictions are provided in Fig. 11. Table 5: Attribute prediction results for the five single viewpoint models. For the continuous attributes (maximum speed and displacement), we display the mean difference from the ground truth. For the discrete attributes (door and seat number, car type), we display the classification accuracy. Mean guess denotes the mean error with a prediction of the mean value on the training set.

In particular, we adopt the classification model in Section 4.1.1 as a feature extractor of the car images, and then apply Joint Bayesian to train a verification model on the Part-II data. Finally, we test the performance of the model on the Part-III data, which includes 1, 145 car models. The test data is organized into three sets, each of which has different difficulty, i.e. easy, medium, and hard. Each set contains 20, 000 pairs of images, including 10, 000 positive pairs and 10, 000 negative pairs. Each image pair in the “easy set” is selected from the same viewpoint, while each pair in the “medium set” is selected from a pair of random viewpoints. Each negative pair in the “hard set” is chosen from the same car make. 6 Deeply learned feature combined with Joint Bayesian has been proven successful for face verification. Joint Bayesian formulates the feature x as the sum of two independent Gaussian variables x = p + e, (1) where p ∼N(0, Σp) represents identity information, and e ∼N(0, Σe) the intra-category variations. Joint Bayesian models the joint probability of two objects given the intra or extra-category varia- tion hypothesis, P(x1, x2|HI) and P(x1, x2|HE). These two probabilities are also Gaussian with variations ΣI = Σp + Σe, ΣE = Σp + Σe (2) and ΣI = Σp + Σe, ΣE = Σe (3) respectively. Σp and Σe can be learned from data with EM algorithm. In the testing stage, it calculates the likelihood ratio r(x1, x2) = log P(x1, x2|HI) P(x1, x2|HE), (4) which has closed-form solution. The feature extracted from the CNN model has a dimension of 4, 096, which is reduced to 20 by PCA. The compressed features are then utilized to train the Joint Bayesian model. During the testing stage, each image pair is classified by comparing the likelihood ratio produced by Joint Bayesian with a threshold. This model is denoted as (CNN feature + Joint Bayesian). The second method combines the CNN features and SVM, denoted as CNN feature + SVM. Here, SVM is a binary classifier using a pair of image features as input. The label ‘1’ represents positive pair, while ‘0’ represents negative pair. We extract 100, 000 pairs of image features from Part-II data for training. The performances of the two models are shown in Table 6 and the ROC curves for the “hard set” are plotted in Fig. 14. We observe that CNN feature + Joint Bayesian outperforms CNN feature + SVM with large margins, indicating the advantage of Joint Bayesian for this task. However, its benefit in car verification is not as effective as in face verification, where CNN and Joint Bayesian nearly saturated the LFW dataset and approached human performance. Fig. 12 depicts several pairs of test images as well as their predictions by CNN feature + Joint Bayesian. We observe two major challenges. First, for the image pair of the same model but different viewpoints, it is difficult to obtain the correspondences directly from the raw image pixels. Second, the appearances of different car models of the same car make are extremely similar. It is difficult to distinguish these car models using the entire images. Part localization or detection is crucial for car verification. Table 6: The verification accuracy of three baseline models.

The split of the dataset into the three tasks is similar to Section 4, where three subsets contain 431, 111, and 1, 145 car models, with 52, 083, 11, 129, and 72, 962 images respectively. The only difference is that we adopt full set of CompCars in order to establish updated baseline experiments and to make use of the dataset to the largest extent. We keep the testing sets of car verification same to those in Section 4.3. We evaluate three network structures, namely AlexNet, Overfeat, and GoogLeNet for all three tasks. All networks are pre-trained on the ImageNet classification task, and fine-tuned with the same mini-batch size, epochs, and learning rates for each task. All predictions of the deep models are produced with a single center crop of the image. We use Caffe as the platform for our experiments. 7 The experimental results can serve as baselines in any later research works. The train/test splits can be downloaded from CompCars webpage. 5.1 Fine-Grained Classification In this section, we classify the car images into 431 car models as in Section 4.1.1. We divide the data into 70 Table 7: The classification accuracies of three deep models.

For the continuous attributes (maximum speed and displacement), we display the mean difference from the ground truth (lower is better). For the discrete attributes (door and seat number, car type), we display the classification accuracy (higher is better).

Different from Section 4.2 where models are trained with cars in single viewpoints, we train with images in all viewpoints to build a compact model. Table 8 summarizes the results for the three networks, where “mean guess” represents the prediction with the mean of the values on the training set. GoogLeNet performs the best for all attributes and Overfeat is a close running-up. 5.3 Car Verification The evaluation pipeline follows Section 4.3. We evaluate the three deep models combined with two verification models: Joint Bayesian and SVM with polynomial kernel. The feature extracted from the CNN models is reduced to 200 by PCA before training and testing in all experiments. The performances of the three networks combined with the two verification models are shown in Table 9, where each model is denoted by name of the deep model + name of the verification model. GoogLeNet + Joint Bayesian achieves the best performance in all three settings. For each deep model, Joint Bayesian outperforms SVM consistently. Compared to Table 6, Overfeat + Joint Bayesian yields a performance gain of 2 4 8",1,,,,
P103.pdf,"Equivariant Adaptation of Large Pretrained Models: A Study on the NLC2CMD Competition Abstract This paper presents an investigation into the challenges of adapting pretrained models, specifically in the context of the NLC2CMD competition. 1 Introduction This paper addresses the critical need for effective methods to translate natural language descriptions into executable command-line instructions. The command line interface (CLI) is an important tool for software development due to its expressiveness and efficiency. While GUIs have difficulties keeping up with the rapid pace of new features in software development, CLIs provide a text-based interface to a wide range of software functionalities. The use of natural language for CLI interaction could transform how people interact with various operating systems and cloud platforms. This paper explores the possibilities of leveraging natural language to interact with CLIs making computational resources more accessible to a wider range of users. 2 Task Description The primary objective of the NLC2CMD task is to transform a natural language (NL) description of a command-line action into its corresponding Bash command. An algorithm is expected to model the top-k Bash translations given the natural language description. This can be represented mathematically as: Anlc ∈{p | p = (c, δ)}; |A(nlc)| < k Each prediction from the model includes a set of Bash commands along with a confidence score, δ, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. This confidence score can be utilized to filter out uncertain predictions and is incorporated into the evaluation process. The default confidence is set to 1.0, indicating full confidence in the model’s prediction. 3 Competition Overview The competition occurred between July and November of 2020, encompassing training, validation, and testing phases. A total of 20 teams registered for the competition, and among these, 9 teams participated through the end of the testing phase. The teams were allowed 100 submissions in the first two phases, and a maximum of 10 submissions for the final phase, with daily submission limits. The EvalAI platform was used for hosting the competition. 4 Data 4.1 NL2Bash The NL2Bash dataset was utilized, consisting of around 10,000 pairs of natural language descriptions paired with corresponding command line syntax. . 4.2 Tellina Query Log Around 1000 natural language utterances recorded from user interactions with the Tellina system was collected. Three programmers with Bash experience annotated these, resulting in multiple ground truth labels for many examples in the dataset. 4.3 NLC2CMD Data Collection Track A parallel data-collection track was included in the competition, collecting natural language to bash command pairs through a web interface on the competition website. 21 participants from industry and academia submitted over 120 examples, which after being filtered, were part of the final phase of the challenge. 4.4 Data partitions and pipeline The data was filtered for each data sample through a Bash parser to ensure that only valid Bash commands were included. Any text that was not a valid Bash command or used utilities not in the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS command set was removed. For training, participants were provided with a filtered version of the NL2Bash dataset, as well as man pages for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. In addition, participants were allowed to use any other publicly available data for training. The data set was split into training, validation and test sets with different sizes for each. In addition to the original utilities of the first phase of the competition, 27 additional utilities were added in subsequent phases. 5 Metrics The submissions to the NLC2CMD competition were assessed based on two primary metrics: accuracy and energy consumption. This approach was utilized to better evaluate submitted solutions. 5.1 Accuracy This section discusses the metrics used to evaluate the task of translating natural language to Bash code. Existing metrics such as Full Command Accuracy, BLEU score, and Template Accuracy, are reviewed and it is found that they all have shortcomings. The paper presents a metric, verification by execution, which is able to solve these problems. Finally, the metric that was proposed for the competition is discussed in depth. 5.1.1 Existing Metrics Full Command Accuracy is a metric that measures the exact match between a generated code and a reference code. BLEU scores computes the n-grams of candidate translations with the n-grams of the reference translation. Template Accuracy measures if the command templates match but not exact arguments of the command. 5.1.2 Verification by Execution Because Bash is a Turing complete language, the equivalence of two commands is undecidable. To handle this issue, the execution of predicted and reference commands is compared to determine accuracy. 5.1.3 NLC2CMD Metric This paper presents a metric that ignores the arguments in the predicted commands, considers the order of utilities in piped commands and penalizes excess flags. SF i (Cpred, Cref) = 2 ∗|F (U(Cpred)i)∩F (U(Cref )i)| |F (U(Cpred)i)∪F (U(Cref )i)| S(p) = maxCref 1 T PT i=1 I[U(Cpred)i == U(Cref)i] ∗SF i (Cpred, Cref) The overall score is then computed as follows: 2 Score(A(nlc)) = { m axp∈A(nlc)S(p), if∃p ∈A(nlc)suchthatS(p) > 0 avgp∈A(nlc)S(p), otherwise This metric encourages the correct utilities and their flags, weighted by the algorithm’s reported confidence. This metric was chosen for the competition due to the constraints of a conference setting and the need to focus on the core aspects of command synthesis. 5.2 Energy Efficiency This section discusses the metric of energy efficiency of models, and its relevance in the current research environment. The energy consumption of machine learning models is an area of focus, with the deployment of these models, their inference phase energy consumption can outweigh their training cost over time. The experiment-impact-tracker library was used to measure the energy consumption of submitted solutions. 6 Competing Solutions The final leaderboard of the NLC2CMD competition consisted of 6 teams/entries, along with 2 baselines. The leaderboard included the accuracy score, energy consumption and latency of the models. Table 1: Final leaderboard for the NLC2CMD competition, showing the accuracy score for the final (test) phase, along with the energy consumed and latency for every invocation.

The approach that was most successful used an information retrieval (IR) method based on Tf-IDF rankings. Several variations of this method were tested, with the addition of the AInix Archie data, pruning duplicates, normalizing NL tokens and adjusting the confidence.

Key strategies used in their approach include: Replacing command parameters with generic tokenizations, producing scores using an approximation for confidence, and testing different combinations of encoders and decoders. 3 6.3 Fine-tuned GPT-2 in Ensemble The team Hubris fine-tuned pre-trained transformer models, specifically, the GPT-2 architecture. The NL2Bash dataset was also augmented with heuristically mined data from stack-overflow questions. Two models of different sizes and pre-training were used, and the final commands were selected by a heuristic algorithm that maximized the minimal word distance between the commands. 6.4 Multi-Step Pipelines The multi-step approach involves combining two different models for two separate steps. The first step involves predicting the best utility, and the second step involves predicting the correct flags to use. This can be seen in the models of team jb and team coinse. 7 Discussion This section summarizes lessons learned and discussions with participants during the competition. 7.1 Metrics Revision This section discusses suggested alternatives for accuracy and energy measurements. 7.1.1 Suggested Alternatives for Accuracy Measurement Some suggestions for future metrics include: a metric that measures semantic match instead of exact command matching; restricting the range of commands covered; a metric that measures mean reciprocal rank; a metric that measures session scores over multiple interactions instead of one; using adaptability of algorithms; making fast retraining available; and calibration of penalties. The issues of statefulness of commands, command injection, full text match and underdetermined invocations are also reviewed. 7.1.2 Suggested Alternatives for Energy Measurement The issues with power measurement, such as reducing computation to lower peak consumption are discussed. It is stated that measurement of total energy consumption may be a better solution. It is argued whether there is even any point to measuring energy at all due to how small the amount of energy is consumed. 7.2 Other Enhancements Other enhancements include communication of explanations to users by converting commands back to natural language, and conversational interfaces to allow for more context for the system. 8 Conclusion In this paper, the NLC2CMD competition is discussed, including the methodology, data used and the metrics of the competition. Going forward, the feedback received will be incorporated in future iterations of the competition. 4",0,,,,
P104.pdf,"Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference Abstract While large pre-trained language models are powerful, their predictions often lack logical consistency across test inputs. For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model’s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model’s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model’s predictions. Our experi- ments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5 1 Introduction Reliable and trustworthy AI systems should demonstrate internal self-consistency, in the sense that their predictions across inputs should imply logically compatible beliefs about the world. However, even powerful large language models are known to lack self-consistency. For example, a question- answering (QA) model that answers the question Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? with Yes is implicitly expressing the belief that A sparrow is a bird and A bird has feet. If the same model answers the question Does a sparrow have feet? with No, the model expresses the logically incompatible belief A sparrow does not have feet. In such cases, ascertaining the model’s ˘201ctrue˘201d belief is difficult, making interpreting and validating its behavior correspondingly challenging. Prior work has improved model self-consistency by training with specialized loss functions or data augmentation, or alternatively re-ranking model predictions based on their mutual self-consistency using pre-written logical constraints, such as ˘201call mammals have fur˘201d. However, the first class of methods requires expensive fine-tuning which might be impractical for many practitioners for very large pre-trained models, and re-ranking methods require an explicit collection of the logical relations of interest, making scaling a challenge. Still, re-ranking-based approaches have the benefit of not requiring fine-tuning, and we hypothesize that their scalability limitations may be addressed by estimating logical relationships between model predictions on the fly. Specifically, we hypothesize that existing pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models can estimate logical relationships between an arbitrary pair of model predictions well enough to provide an effective, scalable substitute for explicit collection of such constraints. Leveraging these estimated constraints, we can construct a factor graph representing a probability distribution over model outputs that incorporates both the original model’s confidence scores and the NLI model’s beliefs about logical relationships. Our primary contribution is Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, a framework to improve the consistency and performance of a pre-trained base language model without fine-tuning by using more confident and better attested model predictions to override less confident model beliefs. To enable propagation of model beliefs, we estimate pair-wise logical relationships between model predictions using a pre-trained NLI model. Using these pair-wise relationships, we define an undirected graphical model representing a distribution over responses accounting for both the base model’s beliefs and the NLI model’s estimates of answer compatibility. We efficiently find the approximate mode of this distribution among the base model’s top answer choices for each input as the solution of a MaxSAT problem, which consistently produces more accurate and self-consistent predictions than using the raw model predictions. We find that ConCoRD produces an 8.1 2 Related Work Prior work for maintaining consistency in the question-answering space often involves additional training to improve performance. Some work generates questions from unlabeled texts, then filters them to ensure roundtrip consistency; pre-training on this synthetic set improves performance on SQuAD 2.0 and Natural Questions. Other work augments QA-pairs with their logically symmetric and transitive counterparts through linguistic approaches to enhance cross-dataset QA performance. ConCoRD differs significantly from these question-answering-specific approaches because no fine- tuning of the base model is needed and the methodology is not specific to question-answering. Similarly to ConCoRD, other work re-rank model predictions by solving an optimization problem defined by a combination of the base model confidence scores and pair-wise constraints representing the logical compatibility of different model predictions stored in a persistent memory, which they call BeliefBank. The key distinguishing property of ConCoRD is the fact that pair-wise constraints between model predictions are dynamically estimated by a pre-trained NLI model, rather than drawn from a fixed, pre-collected set of constraints. Dynamically estimating the constraints has a variety of benefits, eliminating the need for manually collecting the logical constraints of interest, automating the process of determining whether a particular constraint applies to a particular pair of predictions, and likely inheriting improvements in Natural language inference (NLI) models over time. NLI has long been used to maintain logical consistency in generated dialogue utterances, radiology report domain entities, and summarization. Perhaps most similarly, other work uses NLI to estimate constraints between factual statements produced by GPT-3. These prior approaches support our intuition for using NLI models to improve logical consistency among batches of answers. While the authors explore applications of this framework to multi-step reasoning for True/False questions or statements, our work focuses on applying this methodology to more general settings, such as VQA, open-ended QA, and model editing. 3 Consistency Correction through Relation Detection ConCoRD contains three key components, the base model, a relation model (typically a pre-trained NLI model), and an inference procedure that combines the predictions of the two models into a more accurate and self-consistent set of beliefs. Importantly, both the base model and relation model are pre-trained, off-the-shelf models; ConCoRD does not update any weights or require training data for either model, using only a small validation set for hyperparameter tuning. We next explain the function of each of these components when executing ConCoRD. 3.1 Base Model The core function of the base model in ConCoRD is generating a set of candidate outputs for a given input, which are ultimately re-ranked by the inference process (Sec. 3.3). Given a batch of N model queries Q = {qi}, the first step of ConCoRD is to generate a set of J candidate outputs for each query ˆAi = {ˆai1, ..., ˆaiJ}, along with their corresponding likelihoods pθ(ˆaij|qi). Note that the candidate outputs need not be an IID sample from the base model; for example, we might use beam search with a diversity bonus to produce a more diverse set of candidates. Each pair of query and candidate 2 output forms a model belief bij = (qi, ˆaij); the output of the base model is the complete set of model beliefs B = {bij} and their corresponding normalized probabilities pij. The base models in our experiments are pre-trained question-answering models based on T5-large and pre-trained visual question-answering models such as LXMERT and ViLT. 3.2 Relation Model The relation model pθ(: |xi, x′) estimates the most likely logical relationship between an ordered pair of natural language utterances from the choices {none, fwd −entail, contradict, equivalence}. In addition to the model beliefs B, we define optional context statements cijk = C(bij), K relevant statements that may be retrieved, generated, or manually written for each model belief. The ability to incorporate context statements enables ConCoRD to modulate model behavior independently for each input in the test batch, rather than reasoning transductively about pairs of test inputs. Inputs to the relation model are either pairs of two model beliefs (bij, bi′j′) or pairs of one model belief and one context statement (bij, cijk). We define the most likely inter-belief relation as rij,i′j′ = argmaxrpθ(r|bij, bi′j′), and similarly for belief-context relations rij,k = argmaxrpθ(r|bij, cijk). The output of the relation model is the set of most-likely relations R = {rij,i′j′} ∪{rij,k} and their associated probabilities, which we denote as pij,i′j′ ϕ and pij,k ϕ . Our experiments use various pre-trained NLI models based on RoBERTa and ALBERT as the relation model. Question-answer to statement conversion. While concatenating query qi and candidate output ˆaij to produce inputs to the relation model is perhaps the simplest approach to estimating soft constraints, we use a statement conversion model to provide inputs to the relation model that are closer to its training distribution. Instead of defining the belief bij = (qi, ˆaij) as concatenation of qi and ˆaij, we define bij to be the statement fϕ(qi, ˆaij), where fϕ is the conversion model. We fine-tune a small T5 model on a combination of data from and BeliefBank to produce a model that maps a (question, answer) pair into a natural language statement. 3.3 Inference ConCoRD’s inference procedure maps the set of beliefs B and pair-wise relations R into a choice of the most likely belief for each question. To define the inference problem, we first define a binary decision variable zij representing the estimated truth value of model belief bij. A value of 1 for node zij in the maximum likelihood configuration means that ˆaij is returned for query qi; the problem includes a constraint that exactly one candidate answer is true for each query. The factor graph includes the set of variables Z = {zij}N,J i,j=1,1 and various factors (functions mapping a subset of Z to a non-negative scalar) derived from the base model and relation model’s beliefs and the hard constraint of returning only one answer per question. Factors are defined such that more desirable configurations of zij yield a larger product of the individual factors. First, unary factors ϕij(zij) encode the base model’s beliefs about the likelihood of specific answers, and are defined as: ϕij(zij) = { p ij ifzij = 11 −pijotherwise (1) where pij = pθ(ˆaij|qi); in other words, the factor takes the odds ratio if the corresponding statement variable zij is assigned a truth value of 1; otherwise, the factor takes value 1. In order to encode the hard constraint that exactly one output should be returned for each query, we include a J-ary factor ϕi(Zi) for each group of nodes Zi = {zij}J j=1, which is equal to 1 for configurations where exactly one of the nodes takes a value of 1, and 0 for all other configurations. Binary factors ψij,i′j′(zij, zi′j′) and optionally ψijk(zij, cijk) encode compatibility between pairs of model beliefs (or model belief-context pairs): ψij,i′j′(zij, zi′j′) = { 1 ifrij,i′j′(zij, zi′j′)pij,i′j′ ϕ otherwise (2) where we define the relation function rij,i′j′ to evaluate to true if its arguments satisfy the underlying relation, and false otherwise; ψijk(zij, cijk) is defined similarly to ψij,i′j′(zij, zi′j′). The inference problem amounts to finding argmaxZΦ(Z), where Φ(Z) = Y i ϕi Y ij ϕij Y ij,i′j′ ψij,i′j′ Y ijk ψijk (3) 3 An approximate solution to this inference problem can be efficiently found for most problems with a MaxSAT solver such as RC2. We omit arguments to the factors for conciseness. Entailment correction. Consider a belief b, a set of its entailed statements S = {si}, unary factors ϕ(zb) and {ϕ(zsi)}, and binary factors Ψ = {ψ(zb, zsi)}i. Recall that an entailment relation rij,i′j′(zij, zi′j′) is satisfied (and the binary factor is maximized) if either zb = 0 or all zsi = 1. Consequently, as the cardinality of {zs|zsi = 0} increases, the more likely it is that zb = 0 will maximize the product of all binary factors Q i ψ(zb, zsi). This is true even if most entailed statements are true, ie., |{zs|zsi = 1}| > |{zs|zsi = 0}|. If most of the statements entailed by a belief are true, assigning the belief to be false due to a small number of (potentially spuriously) false entailed statements may be undesirable. To mitigate this outcome, we experiment with an additional type of factor in which configurations satisfying entailments with both zb = 1 and zsi = 1 are ’rewarded’ more than other configurations satisfying the entailment: Ψb,si(zb, zsi) = { 1 ifzb, zsi = 11 −pb,si ϕ ifzb, zsi = 0 q 1 −pb,si ϕ otherwise (4) Applying entailment correction consistently improves ConCoRD’s performance. 3.4 Hyperparameters of ConCoRD We introduce two key hyperparameters to ConCoRD. Because we do not know a priori the relative reliability of the base model and relation model, we introduce the hyperparameter δ ∈[0, 1], corre- sponding to a trade-off between the predictions of the base model and relation model. A value of δ = 1 corresponds to simply taking the raw predictions of the base model, while δ = 0 corresponds to optimizing purely for answers that are self-consistent according to the relation model, without consid- ering the base model’s beliefs. The unary factors in the factor graph become ϕi(zi) = (ϕij(zij))δ and ψij,i′j′(zij, zi′j′) = (ψij,i′j′(zij, zi′j′))1−δ (and similarly for ψijk). In addition to δ, we introduce a threshold λ for relation model confidence to filter out low-confidence relation estimates. That is, we discard a relation rij,i′j′ or rij,k if pij,i′j′ ϕ < λ or pij,k ϕ < λ, respectively. In practice, we find that the optimal δ and λ vary across problems, perhaps due to the varying complexity of the model belief and context statements (and therefore the reliability of the relation model’s predictions). Therefore, we use the hyperopt library for automated hyperparameter optimization, using the Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm to tune δ and λ jointly. We use the optimal hyperparameters found on the validation data for each problem to compute test performance. 4 Experiments Our experiments are broadly designed to answer the high-level question: can ConCoRD leverage the relational knowledge in pre-trained NLI models to produce more accurate, self-consistent system behavior, without additional data or fine-tuning? Further, we investigate ConCoRD’s applicability to performing test-time model editing, or injection of new information, and ConCoRD’s sensitivity to the choice of hyperparameters and types of relations detected. 4.1 Internal Consistency in Closed-Book Question-Answering Protocol. To evaluate the accuracy and consistency of a set B of beliefs, we synthesize a gold standard for those beliefs and the inferred relations R. Following this prior work, we assume the following is given: • A set of entities sm ∈S • A set of unary predicates Pn ∈P • A collection of ˘201cfacts˘201d (Pn(sm))i, whose binary truth value is known • A directed graph of gold-standard constraints G(P, E), whose edges (Pi, Pj) ∈E represent first-order logical formulae From these, we construct simple yes/no questions using natural language templates. For example, for fact Pn(sm), if entity sm represents a lion and predicate Pn represents an ability to drink liquids, 4 the template-generated gold question answer pair (qi, ai) is Q: Is it true that a lion is able to drink liquids?; A: Yes. We evaluate ConCoRD by sampling candidate answers from the top-2 output sizes of a multi-angle question answering model, given a multiple choice angle with choices Yes and No. The questions and retrieved answers (qi, ˆai) form a set of beliefs Bsm for each entity. Since these are closed-book questions, no context statements are supplied; because they are yes/no questions, only one candidate answer is obtained, i.e., J = 1. Question-answer to statement conversion is applied to all questions with a default answer of Yes regardless of the answer ˆai, in order to provide the relation model with positive natural language assertions from which to infer sets of relations Rsm; where the base model answers ˆai are No we replace node zi in the factor graph with its complement. Configurations Zsm are found for each sm ∈S which maximize Equation 2 given Bsm, Rsm and together form a global solution Z. Datasets. We use a database with 12,636 facts (˘201csilver facts˘201d), each indicating whether one of 601 predicates relates to one of 85 entities, as well as 4,060 confidence-weighted first-order constraints manually gathered from ConceptNet, forming a constraint graph G. Additionally, they provide 1,072 distinct ˘201ccalibration facts˘201d, each relating one of 7 entities to one of 334 predicates. We tune β and λ using a validation set of questions generated from the calibration facts, and evaluate test time performance with questions generated from silver facts. Metrics. We measure accuracy using binary F1 between elements zi of the configuration Z maxi- mizing ϕ(Z) (as in Equation 2), and the truth value of facts (Pn(sm))i. We use F1 for evaluation because gold answers are highly biased towards true No answers. We compute consistency within batches of questions using the complement of of conditional constraint violation metric τ, defined here as the proportion of relevant gold constraints in G which are violated; a constraint ∀(Pi(x) →Pj(x)) is relevant iff, for some entity s, there is some belief bi ∈B, sm from fact (Pi(sm))i such that zi = 1, and there is some belief bj ∈Bsm that corresponds to fact (Pj(sm))j; the constraint is violated when zj = 0. Comparisons. ConCoRD is evaluated against a naive baseline where only base model answers ˆai and probabilities are considered. A second baseline (G.C.) performs the inference described in Sec. 3.3, replacing the inferred relations R with the gold constraints from constraint graph G, rather than those estimated by the relation model. Results. Results are shown in Table 1. ConCoRD provides an absolute improvement of over 8% in F1 and consistency for Macaw-Large and 7% for Macaw-3B compared to the baseline. Notably, the margin of superiority of the Macaw-3B base model is mostly preserved after applying ConCoRD, suggesting that ConCoRD may provide a significant benefit even for very large models. A surprising result is that ConCoRD shows marked improvements in F1 over the gold constraint baseline, suggesting that the detection and filtering of relations ConCoRD provides may, in this setting, be an improvement over rigid adherence to the logical connections specified a priori. Table 1: F1 and consistency (1 - τ ) for two sizes of Macaw QA models, comparing ConCoRD to a naive QA baseline (Base) and ConCoRD with gold constraints (G.C.).

The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task involves a language model generating answers to questions that are directly associated with images. VQA tests for robustness and generalizability of ConCoRD as it introduces an additional layer of difficulty; the task moves away from purely text-based tasks while expanding the answer space to the vocabulary of the LM being used. The questions from the ConVQA dataset and its associated images from the Visual Genome dataset 5 provide an apt setting to assess ConCoRD, as the relatedness of questions for each image provide ample opportunity for model self-inconsistency. The ConVQA dataset consists of a set of images each associated with a group of related questions about the image, such as What color is the horse? and Is the horse brown? for a picture of a brown horse in a stable. We evaluate ConCoRD with two VQA models, LXMERT and ViLT. For each group of questions Qn = {qni}i, we sample the top-2 candidate outputs {ˆani1, ˆani2} for each question, and use a pre-trained NLI model to infer the most likely pair-wise relations R between outputs from different questions. We use the RC2 MaxSAT Solver to estimate the configuration that maximizes Equation 2. Metrics. We report accuracy as the proportion of questions answered correctly across all groups. We infer consistency using a metric previously used in the literature for the ConVQA dataset called ˘201cperfect consistency˘201d. For all groups of related questions, a group is perfectly consistent if all its questions are answered correctly. Perfect consistency then reports the proportion of question groups that were perfectly consistent. While this is not a perfect measure of consistency as it excludes cases in which incorrect answers are consistent with each other, it still serves as a meaningful proxy since the dataset was designed such that any incorrect answer in a question group implies the presence of inconsistency. Datasets. We divide the ConVQA dataset into a ˘201cclean˘201d (i.e. human verified and filtered) test set and a non-test set (train + val + test as defined by previous work). From the non-test set, we sample 10,000 random images equivalent to 123,746 questions to be used as our validation set for tuning our two hyperparameters. We use the clean test set ˘2013 725 images and 6,751 questions ˘2013 to report our final results. Comparisons. ConCoRD is compared with a naive baseline and a top-2 oracle upper bound. The naive baseline is the answer with the highest VQA model probability. Top-2 oracle upper bound selects the correct answer if present within the top-2 predictions of the VQA model. Top-2 is appropriate given our use of the top-2 candidate outputs to generate inferences with NLI models. Results. The final results for ConCoRD, baseline, and oracle upper bound are shown in Table 2. ConCoRD increases the accuracy of LXMERT and ViLT by 5% and 2% respectively, and the consistency of LXMERT and ViLT by 4.9% and 5.9% respectively. Table 2: ConVQA accuracy (Acc.) and perfect consistency (P.C.) of LXMERT and ViLT VQA models with and without ConCoRD. ConCoRD significantly improves accuracy and consistency of both models. Oracle performance is top-2 performance, as ConCoRD attempts to select the best of the top 2 answer choices of the base model. 2*Model Base ConCoRD Oracle Acc. P.C. Acc. P.C. Acc. P.C.

We perform an additional experiment to evaluate ConCoRD’s ability to integrate external factual information into its inference process, rather than only using other predictions in the test batch. Such an ability enables editing a model’s behavior at test time, without re-training, as new information becomes available. We use the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset, rather than BeliefBank, to provide more challenging inputs to the relation model. Given a question from NQ, a sentence from the ground truth context document containing information about the answer is retrieved and provided as an additional input to ConCoRD; we constrain the node representing this context variable in the factor graph to be true. Constraints are predicted between each answer choice and the context statement. As in the other experimental settings, hyperparameters are tuned on the validation set and applied on the test set. Metrics. Model performance is evaluated using the SQuAD F1 score for overlapping tokens, follow- ing the same answer normalization protocols, including lower-casing and removing punctuation. 6 Datasets. The NQ development set consists of 7830 open-book question-answer pairs, with both long and short gold annotations in their context passages. Since the NQ test set is not available, we create a test and validation set from the NQ validation questions as follows: we take the first 5000 questions to form our test set, and the rest to be our val set, which we use for hyperparameter tuning. Then each set is filtered such that only the answerable questions remain. ˘201cAnswerable˘201d is defined as having a ˘201cshort answer¨span defined in the annotations. This filtering process gives 2713 test entries and 1576 val entries. Comparisons. ConCoRD is compared with a naive baseline and an oracle upper bound. All of these approaches operate on the fixed set of QA model answers for a specific QA model (one of T5-Sm-NQ, T5-Lg-NQ, and T5-3B-NQ), specifically the set of top-4 answers for each question. The naive baseline selects the answer with the highest QA model probability, argmaxˆaijpθ(ˆaij|qi). The oracle upper bound approach selects the answer that has the best score with the gold short answer span, argmaxˆaijF1(ˆaij, aij). Results. The results on the test set using the naive baseline, ConCoRD, and oracle upper-bound are reported in Table 4. ConCoRD always outperforms the naive approach, demonstrating that the framework is useful even when each query input is processed independently (i.e., non-transductively). However, despite providing a relative gain of as high as 8.7% over the naive baseline, there is still a gap between ConCoRD and the oracle. This gap may be attributable to the complexity of the NQ questions and context information compared with the statements in prior experimental settings. Other work demonstrates a significant gain in calibration performance from training on MultiNLI to training on a combination of MultiNLI and their NLI corpus adapted from NQ, perhaps hinting that crucial knowledge present in Natural Questions is not covered in MultiNLI, partially explaining the gap between ConCoRD and oracle F1 performance. Overall, these results suggest that ConCoRD can reason between context statements and model beliefs in addition to pairs of model beliefs, improving performance even with the increased complexity of the data. Table 3: Using ConCoRD to inject contextual information into a model’s decisions at test time. Injecting gold Natural Questions contexts consistently improves performance over the base model without requiring fine-tuning. 2*Model F1 Base ConCoRD Oracle T5-Sm-NQ 0.207 0.225 0.281 T5-Lg-NQ 0.314 0.328 0.393 T5-3B-NQ 0.332 0.351 0.423 4.4 Ablating Relation Types Given that we consider two types of relations in our experiments, contradiction and entailment, it is natural to wonder the relative contribution of these to ConCoRD’s performance improvement; Table 5 shows the results of this ablation. We re-run ConCoRD with either entailment or contradiction relations removed, re-tuning the hyperparameters for both of the new settings (contradiction-only or entailment-only). We find that the relative contribution of contradiction and entailment relations varies significantly across models even within the same task, but using both relation types always performs approximately as well or better than using just one, suggesting that both types of detected relations from the NLI model carry useful information. However, we observe in several cases, such as ViLT and the T5 models, that the entailment and contradiction relations may encode somewhat redundant information, as the performance when including either type of constraint alone nearly matches that of using both types. 5 Conclusion This paper presents a novel method, ConCoRD, for enhancing the self-consistency and performance of pre-trained language models without requiring fine-tuning.

Meanwhile, the capricious whims of serendipity play a significant role in shaping the trajectory of our investigation, as we navigate the labyrinthine complexities of atomic structures, replete with mysteries waiting to be unraveled, much like the enigmatic smile of the Mona Lisa, which, upon closer inspection, reveals a labyrinthine web of hidden meanings and symbolism, redolent of the surrealist artworks of Salvador Dali, whose dreamlike landscapes often featured melting clocks and distorted objects, echoing the relativistic notions of time dilation and spatial distortion. The implementation of our research methodology necessitates a synergistic convergence of disparate disciplines, including quantum mechanics, culinary arts, and extreme knitting, which, when combined, yield a rich tapestry of innovative approaches and unorthodox techniques, such as the utilization of habanero peppers to catalyze nuclear reactions, or the deployment of crochet hooks to manipulate the spin of subatomic particles, thereby facilitating the creation of novel materials with extraordinary properties, like the ability to levitate above the surface of a densely packed bowl of Jell-O.

P106.pdf,"Next-Generation Brain-Computer Interfaces for Assistive Devices: Unlocking New Frontiers in Human-Machine Symbiosis Abstract Next-Generation Brain-Computer Interfaces for Assistive Devices is a burgeoning field that seeks to revolutionize the way individuals with disabilities interact with their environment. This paper presents a novel approach to brain-computer inter- face design, leveraging recent advances in neural decoding and machine learning to create more intuitive and effective assistive devices. Our system utilizes a unique combination of electroencephalography and functional near-infrared spectroscopy to decode brain activity, allowing users to control a variety of devices with unprece- dented precision. Interestingly, our research also explores the application of chaos theory and fractal analysis to brain signal processing, yielding some surprising and counterintuitive results that challenge conventional wisdom in the field. By pushing the boundaries of traditional brain-computer interface design, we aim to create a new generation of assistive devices that are more responsive, more adaptive, and more empowering for individuals with disabilities. 1 Introduction The development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) has undergone significant transformations over the years, with a primary focus on enhancing the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. Next-generation BCIs aim to revolutionize the field of assistive devices by incorporating advanced neuroimaging techniques, artificial intelligence, and machine learning algorithms to decode brain signals with unprecedented accuracy. Recently, researchers have been exploring the potential of using unconventional methods, such as analyzing the brain activity of individuals while they are dreaming, to improve the performance of BCIs. This approach, although seemingly illogical, has yielded some intriguing results, including the discovery that the brain’s neural patterns during REM sleep can be used to control a robotic arm with surprising dexterity. Furthermore, the integration of BCIs with virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technolo- gies has opened up new avenues for the development of immersive assistive devices. For instance, a BCI-powered VR system can enable individuals with paralysis to explore virtual environments and interact with virtual objects, thereby enhancing their sense of autonomy and self-esteem. Moreover, the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to modulate brain activity and improve the performance of BCIs, although the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In addition to these advancements, researchers have also been investigating the potential of using BCIs to control assistive devices, such as prosthetic limbs, wheelchairs, and communication devices. One notable example is the development of a BCI-powered exoskeleton that can be controlled by individuals with spinal cord injuries, allowing them to walk again with unprecedented ease. However, despite these significant advancements, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed, including the development of more accurate and robust signal processing algorithms, the improvement of user-machine interfaces, and the reduction of the high costs associated with BCI systems. Interestingly, some researchers have also been exploring the use of unconventional materials, such as edible electrodes made from food products, to develop more user-friendly and affordable BCIs. Although this approach may seem bizarre, it has the potential to revolutionize the field of BCIs by making them more accessible to a wider range of individuals, particularly those in developing countries. Moreover, the use of BCIs to control assistive devices has also raised important questions about the ethics of neural enhancement and the potential risks associated with the use of these technologies. As such, it is essential to develop more comprehensive frameworks for understanding the societal implications of BCIs and to ensure that these technologies are developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner. The development of next-generation BCIs also requires a deeper understanding of the neural mecha- nisms underlying human cognition and behavior. Recent studies have shown that the brain’s neural patterns can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including emotions, attention, and motivation. Therefore, it is essential to develop more sophisticated models of brain function that can take into account these complex interactions and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying BCI control. By developing more advanced BCIs that can decode brain signals with high accuracy and provide seamless control over assistive devices, we can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities and enhance their ability to interact with the world around them. 2 Related Work The development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) has been a rapidly evolving field, with signif- icant advancements in recent years. BCIs have been employed in various applications, including assistive devices, neuroprosthetics, and cognitive enhancement tools. One of the primary challenges in BCI development is the creation of intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that can accurately decode brain signals. To address this challenge, researchers have explored various approaches, including electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and invasive neural recordings. Some studies have investigated the use of unconventional methods, such as analyzing brain activity while subjects are dreaming or in a state of meditation. These approaches have yielded intriguing results, including the discovery of a correlation between brain wave patterns and the vividness of dreams. Furthermore, researchers have explored the use of brain-computer interfaces in animal models, including a study that demonstrated the ability to control a robotic arm using neural signals from a monkey’s brain. Another area of research has focused on the development of BCIs for individuals with severe motor disabilities. These systems aim to provide users with a means of communication and control over their environment, using signals from the brain to operate devices such as computers, wheelchairs, and prosthetic limbs. One notable example is a BCI system that utilizes EEG signals to control a robotic exoskeleton, allowing individuals with paralysis to walk again. However, the high cost and complexity of these systems have limited their widespread adoption. In a surprising turn of events, some researchers have begun exploring the use of BCIs in conjunc- tion with alternative forms of therapy, such as acupuncture and homeopathy. While the scientific community has raised concerns about the efficacy of these approaches, proponents argue that they can enhance the performance of BCIs by promoting relaxation and reducing mental fatigue. For instance, a study found that subjects who underwent acupuncture treatment prior to BCI use exhibited improved signal quality and reduced error rates. Although these findings are intriguing, they require further investigation to fully understand their implications. The use of brain-computer interfaces has also raised important questions about the ethics of neural enhancement and the potential risks associated with invasive neural recordings. Some experts have warned about the potential for BCIs to be used as a means of mind control, highlighting the need for stringent regulations and guidelines to ensure the safe and responsible development of these technologies. Meanwhile, others have speculated about the possibility of using BCIs to enhance human cognition, potentially leading to a new era of human evolution. As research in this field continues to advance, it is essential to consider the broader societal implications of these technologies and ensure that they are developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner. 2 Moreover, the integration of BCIs with other emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT), is expected to revolutionize the field of assistive devices. The potential for BCIs to control smart homes, autonomous vehicles, and other IoT devices could significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. However, this also raises concerns about data privacy, security, and the potential for biases in AI algorithms to perpetuate existing social inequalities. To address these challenges, researchers must prioritize the development of transparent, explainable, and fair AI systems that can be seamlessly integrated with BCIs. Overall, the field of brain-computer interfaces is rapidly evolving, with significant advancements being made in various areas, including signal processing, machine learning, and user interface design. As researchers continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with BCIs, it is essential to consider the potential risks and benefits of these technologies and ensure that they are developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner. By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of BCIs to improve the lives of individuals with disabilities and enhance human cognition, while also promoting a safer and more equitable society. 3 Methodology The development of next-generation brain-computer interfaces for assistive devices necessitates a mul- tidisciplinary approach, integrating concepts from neuroscience, computer science, and engineering. To create an efficient and user-friendly interface, we employed a combination of electroencephalog- raphy and functional near-infrared spectroscopy to record brain activity. The signals were then processed using a novel algorithm that incorporates elements of chaos theory and fractal analysis, allowing for the identification of complex patterns in brain activity. An unexpected yet intriguing approach was the incorporation of a specially designed fragrance emission system, which releases specific scents in response to brain activity. This olfactory feedback mechanism was found to enhance user engagement and focus, leading to improved accuracy in device control. The scents used were carefully selected based on their purported effects on cognitive function, including peppermint for attention and lavender for relaxation. The brain-computer interface was then integrated with a variety of assistive devices, including robotic arms, wheelchairs, and communication systems. Users were able to control these devices with remarkable precision, achieving a high level of autonomy and independence. However, it was observed that the interface was also susceptible to interference from external factors, such as changes in weather patterns and the phases of the moon. This led to the development of a lunar cycle compensation algorithm, which adjusts the interface’s sensitivity and response time based on the current lunar phase. In a bizarre yet fascinating tangent, it was discovered that the brain-computer interface was also capable of detecting and responding to the user’s subconscious thoughts and desires. This was achieved through the use of a specially designed subconscious resonance chamber, which amplifies and decodes the user’s unconscious brain activity. The implications of this discovery are profound, and could potentially lead to the development of new technologies that can read and respond to human thoughts and emotions. The methodology used in this study was rigorous and systematic, involving a comprehensive analysis of user data and device performance. However, it was also marked by a series of illogical and seemingly flawed results, which were nonetheless presented as legitimate findings. For example, it was found that the brain-computer interface was more accurate when used in conjunction with a specific brand of coffee, and that the device’s performance was enhanced by the presence of a small, furry animal in the room. These results were attributed to the complex and dynamic nature of the human brain, and the need for further research into the underlying mechanisms and principles of brain-computer interaction. 4 Experiments To evaluate the effectiveness of our data-driven approach in preserving ancient musical instruments, we conducted a series of experiments involving a range of instruments from different historical periods. Our experimental design consisted of two primary components: a control group, where 3 traditional preservation methods were employed, and a treatment group, where our data-driven approach was applied. The treatment group was further divided into two sub-groups: one where the instruments were preserved using a machine learning-based technique, and another where a more unorthodox approach was used, involving the use of sound waves generated by a didgeridoo to ""heal"" the instruments. The machine learning-based technique involved training a neural network on a dataset of images and audio recordings of the instruments, with the goal of predicting the optimal preservation strategy for each instrument. This approach showed promising results, with a significant reduction in deterioration observed in the treated instruments compared to the control group. However, the didgeridoo-based approach yielded surprising results, with some instruments showing an unexpected increase in deterioration, while others appeared to be unaffected. We speculate that the sound waves generated by the didgeridoo may have had an unpredictable effect on the instrument’s materials, potentially disrupting the preservation process. In addition to these experiments, we also conducted a series of simulations to model the effects of different environmental factors on the preservation of ancient musical instruments. These simulations involved creating virtual models of the instruments and subjecting them to various environmental stresses, such as changes in temperature and humidity. The results of these simulations provided valuable insights into the potential risks and challenges associated with preserving ancient musical instruments, and highlighted the need for a more nuanced and data-driven approach to preservation. To further illustrate the effectiveness of our data-driven approach, we present the results of our experiments in the following table: These results demonstrate the potential benefits of using a Table 1: Comparison of Preservation Outcomes Instrument Control Group Machine Learning-Based Didgeridoo-Based Simulation Results Lyre 20% deterioration 5% deterioration 30% deterioration 15% deterioration Flute 15% deterioration 3% deterioration 20% deterioration 10% deterioration Harp 30% deterioration 10% deterioration 40% deterioration 20% deterioration data-driven approach to preserve ancient musical instruments, and highlight the need for further research into the application of machine learning and other technologies in this field. Furthermore, the unusual results obtained from the didgeridoo-based approach suggest that there may be alternative, unconventional methods for preserving ancient musical instruments that warrant further investigation. Overall, our experiments demonstrate the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to preservation, incorporating insights from materials science, musicology, and computer science to develop effective strategies for preserving our cultural heritage. 5 Results The application of data-driven approaches to the preservation of ancient musical instruments has yielded a plethora of intriguing findings, challenging conventional wisdom and sparking debate within the community. A comprehensive analysis of the acoustic properties of ancient instruments, facilitated by cutting-edge signal processing techniques, has enabled researchers to pinpoint subtle patterns and anomalies that were previously unknown. For instance, a peculiar correlation was discovered between the resonant frequencies of ancient lyres and the celestial movements of celestial bodies, prompting some investigators to propose a radical new theory: that the instruments were, in fact, designed to harmonize with the cosmos. This hypothesis, though unorthodox, has sparked a flurry of interest and experimentation, with some researchers attempting to recreate the supposed ""cosmic harmonics"" using modern instrumentation and machine learning algorithms. While the results of these experiments are still inconclusive, they have nevertheless led to the development of novel preservation techniques, such as the use of artificial intelligence-powered resonators to enhance the sonic properties of fragile or damaged instruments. Moreover, the incorporation of data-driven methods has facilitated the creation of detailed, high- fidelity digital models of ancient instruments, allowing for unprecedented levels of analysis and simulation. 4 One of the most significant breakthroughs in this field has been the discovery of a previously unknown type of ancient instrument, hidden away in a long-forgotten archive of archaeological artifacts. Through a combination of computational modeling and experimental reconstruction, researchers have been able to recreate the instrument, which has been dubbed the ""Aurora Pipe."" Preliminary findings suggest that the Aurora Pipe possesses unique acoustic properties, capable of generating an extraordinary range of tonal frequencies and harmonics. Further study of this enigmatic instrument is expected to shed new light on the evolution of ancient music and the cultural context in which it was created. To illustrate the efficacy of data-driven preservation techniques, a comparative study was conducted on a selection of ancient instruments, with results presented in the following table: The data clearly in- Table 2: Comparison of preservation techniques for ancient instruments Instrument Traditional Preservation Data-Driven Preservation Aurora Pipe Enhancement Lyre of Thebes 75% 92% 98% Flute of Delphi 60% 85% 95% Harp of Babylon 50% 80% 92% dicates that the data-driven approach, particularly when combined with the Aurora Pipe enhancement, yields superior results in terms of instrument preservation and restoration. As research in this field continues to advance, it is likely that even more innovative and effective methods will be developed, ultimately leading to a deeper understanding and appreciation of ancient musical instruments and the cultures that created them. 6 Conclusion In conclusion, the data-driven preservation of ancient musical instruments presents a unique op- portunity for interdisciplinary research, combining musicology, materials science, and artificial intelligence. By analyzing large datasets of instrument characteristics, environmental factors, and restoration techniques, researchers can develop predictive models to forecast the degradation of instruments over time. However, an unconventional approach to preservation involves utilizing the sonic properties of the instruments themselves to generate a self-sustaining feedback loop, where the instrument’s own vibrations are used to repair and maintain its structural integrity. This method, dubbed ""sonic autorepair,"" proposes that the inherent harmonics and resonant frequencies of the instrument can be harnessed to stimulate a process of self-healing, effectively reversing the effects of aging and wear. While this idea may seem far-fetched, it underscores the innovative and often unorthodox nature of research in this field, where the intersection of art and science can lead to novel and groundbreaking solutions. Furthermore, the development of data-driven preservation strategies has significant implications for the conservation of cultural heritage, enabling the protection and restoration of historic instruments for future generations to appreciate and study. Ultimately, the pursuit of knowledge in this area has the potential to not only advance our understanding of ancient musical instruments but also inspire new technologies and approaches to preservation, pushing the boundaries of what is thought to be possible in the realm of cultural conservation. 5 ",1,,,,
P107.pdf,"Neural Approaches to Real-Time Weather Forecasting: Unlocking the Potential of Artificial Intelligence in Meteorology Abstract The pursuit of accurate and efficient real-time weather forecasting has been a longstanding endeavor, with recent advancements in neural networks and deep learning techniques offering unprecedented opportunities for innovation in this field. By leveraging the complex patterns and relationships inherent in meteorological data, neural approaches can potentially revolutionize the way we predict and prepare for various weather phenomena. Furthermore, the integration of neural networks with traditional forecasting methods can lead to the development of hybrid models that capitalize on the strengths of both paradigms, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of weather forecasts. In addition to exploring the applications of well-established neural architectures, such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks, in the context of weather forecasting, our research also delves into the realm of more unconven- tional approaches. For instance, we investigate the potential benefits of utilizing neural networks that are trained on datasets comprised of fractal patterns and chaos theory principles, with the aim of capturing the intricate and often unpredictable nature of atmospheric dynamics. Moreover, we examine the feasibility of employ- ing neural networks that are capable of learning from non-traditional data sources, such as social media posts and crowdsourced weather reports, in order to gather more diverse and comprehensive information about current weather conditions. 1 Introduction The pursuit of accurate and efficient weather forecasting has been a longstanding endeavor, with significant advancements in recent years owing to the integration of neural network architectures. These complex systems, inspired by the human brain’s neural structure, have demonstrated unparal- leled capabilities in pattern recognition and predictive modeling, making them an ideal candidate for tackling the intricate and dynamic nature of atmospheric phenomena. The application of neural approaches to real-time weather forecasting has opened up new avenues for improving forecast accuracy, reducing latency, and enhancing the overall reliability of weather prediction systems. Historically, weather forecasting relied heavily on physical models that simulated the behavior of the atmosphere based on governing laws of physics and thermodynamics. While these models have provided a foundation for understanding and predicting weather patterns, they are often limited by their complexity, computational intensity, and the need for high-quality initial and boundary conditions. The advent of neural networks has introduced a paradigm shift, allowing for the direct learning of patterns from large datasets, thereby bypassing the need for explicit physical formulations. This data-driven approach has shown promising results, particularly in forecasting phenomena that are difficult to model using traditional methods, such as precipitation patterns, storm tracks, and temperature fluctuations. One of the more unconventional approaches to neural weather forecasting involves the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create synthetic weather patterns that can be used to augment real-world datasets, thereby enhancing model training and improving forecast accuracy. This method, while unorthodox, leverages the adversarial process between generator and discriminator networks to produce highly realistic weather scenarios, including extreme events that are rare in historical records but crucial for robust forecasting models. Furthermore, the integration of chaotic theory principles into neural network design has been explored, with some researchers proposing that the inherent chaos in weather systems can be harnessed to improve predictive capabilities. This line of inquiry, though speculative, suggests that embracing the chaotic nature of atmospheric dynamics rather than trying to tame it could lead to breakthroughs in forecast reliability and precision. The inclusion of social media and crowd-sourced data as additional layers of information for neural weather forecasting models represents another innovative, albeit somewhat untested, approach. The rationale behind this method is that real-time reports from individuals can provide ground truth data on weather conditions, serving as a complementary or even primary source of information in areas where traditional observation networks are sparse or nonexistent. While concerns regarding data quality, reliability, and potential biases are valid, proponents argue that the sheer volume and diversity of social media data could offset these drawbacks, offering a unique opportunity for models to learn from a broader spectrum of experiences and observations. In a departure from conventional wisdom, some researchers have explored the application of neural networks to forecast weather patterns based on astrological principles, arguing that celestial bodies and their positions could exert a previously unrecognized influence on atmospheric conditions. This esoteric approach, though dismissed by many as lacking a scientific basis, has surprisingly yielded some intriguing results, with certain models appearing to capture subtle patterns in weather data that correlate with planetary alignments and lunar cycles. While these findings are preliminary and require rigorous validation, they underscore the creativity and open-mindedness that characterize the current landscape of neural weather forecasting research. The rise of edge computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) has also played a significant role in the development of real-time weather forecasting systems, enabling the deployment of neural networks on remote devices and sensors. This distributed architecture allows for the processing of weather data closer to its source, reducing latency and enhancing the responsiveness of forecasting models. Moreover, the proliferation of low-cost, high-performance computing platforms has democratized access to neural network development, fostering a community-driven approach to weather forecasting where individuals and organizations can contribute their expertise and resources to improve collective predictive capabilities. Despite the strides made in neural approaches to weather forecasting, numerous challenges persist, including the need for better understanding and mitigation of model biases, the development of more efficient training algorithms, and the integration of multimodal data sources to enhance forecast accuracy and robustness. Additionally, the interpretability of neural network models remains a pressing concern, as the complex, nonlinear relationships learned by these models often obfuscate the underlying decision-making processes, making it difficult to discern the physical and dynamical principles that underpin their predictions. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for the continued advancement of neural weather forecasting, necessitating interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation at the intersection of atmospheric science, computer science, and engineering. In conclusion, the field of neural approaches to real-time weather forecasting is characterized by a vibrant diversity of ideas, methodologies, and applications, reflecting the complexity and multifaceted nature of atmospheric phenomena. From the application of state-of-the-art neural network architectures to the exploration of unconventional data sources and forecasting principles, researchers are continually pushing the boundaries of what is possible in weather prediction, driven by the ultimate goal of providing accurate, reliable, and timely forecasts that can inform decision- making and mitigate the impacts of severe weather events. As the field evolves, it is likely that novel, perhaps unorthodox, approaches will emerge, challenging existing paradigms and contributing to the development of more sophisticated, effective, and sustainable weather forecasting systems. 2 Related Work The realm of real-time weather forecasting has undergone a significant transformation in recent years, with the advent of neural approaches revolutionizing the way we predict and understand weather patterns. Traditionally, weather forecasting relied heavily on physical models that utilized complex 2 equations to describe atmospheric conditions, but these models often struggled to capture the inherent complexities and nuances of the weather. The emergence of neural networks has enabled researchers to develop more sophisticated and accurate forecasting systems, capable of learning patterns and relationships within vast amounts of weather data. One of the earliest neural approaches to weather forecasting involved the use of simple feedforward networks, which were trained on historical weather data to predict future weather conditions. These early models demonstrated promising results, but were often limited by their inability to capture complex spatial and temporal relationships within the data. To address this limitation, researchers began exploring the use of more advanced neural architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are particularly well-suited for modeling sequential and spatial data. RNNs, for example, have been used to model the temporal dynamics of weather patterns, allowing researchers to predict future weather conditions based on historical trends and patterns. These models have been shown to be particularly effective in predicting short-term weather patterns, such as hourly temperature and precipitation forecasts. CNNs, on the other hand, have been used to analyze spatial patterns in weather data, such as cloud formations and atmospheric circulation patterns. By combining these two architectures, researchers have been able to develop more comprehensive forecasting systems that capture both the spatial and temporal complexities of the weather. In addition to these traditional neural architectures, researchers have also begun exploring more unconventional approaches to weather forecasting. For example, some studies have investigated the use of neural networks to predict weather patterns based on analysis of social media posts and online search queries. The idea behind this approach is that certain keywords and phrases may be indicative of weather-related events, such as tweets about heavy rainfall or Facebook posts about extreme heat. By analyzing these online trends, researchers believe that they can gain insights into emerging weather patterns and make more accurate forecasts. Another unusual approach to weather forecasting involves the use of neural networks to analyze the sounds of nature, such as bird songs and ocean waves. The idea behind this approach is that these natural sounds may contain hidden patterns and frequencies that are related to weather patterns. For example, researchers have found that the songs of certain bird species may change in response to changes in temperature and humidity, while the sounds of ocean waves may be influenced by wind patterns and sea state. By analyzing these natural sounds using neural networks, researchers believe that they can develop more accurate and holistic forecasting systems that capture the intricate relationships between the natural world and the weather. Furthermore, some researchers have even explored the use of neural networks to predict weather patterns based on analysis of art and music. The idea behind this approach is that certain artistic and musical themes may be reflective of weather-related moods and emotions, such as the use of stormy imagery in paintings or the composition of music that evokes feelings of calmness and serenity. By analyzing these artistic and musical themes using neural networks, researchers believe that they can gain insights into the emotional and psychological dimensions of weather and develop more nuanced and human-centric forecasting systems. In a somewhat bizarre twist, some researchers have also investigated the use of neural networks to predict weather patterns based on analysis of culinary trends and food preferences. The idea behind this approach is that certain types of cuisine may be more popular during certain types of weather, such as the consumption of hot and spicy foods during cold weather or the preference for cool and refreshing foods during hot weather. By analyzing these culinary trends using neural networks, researchers believe that they can develop more accurate and culturally-sensitive forecasting systems that capture the complex relationships between food, culture, and weather. Moreover, the use of neural networks in weather forecasting has also been explored in the context of chaotic systems and complexity theory. Researchers have found that neural networks can be used to model and predict the behavior of chaotic systems, such as the atmosphere and oceans, which are characterized by intricate patterns and feedback loops. By analyzing these complex systems using neural networks, researchers believe that they can develop more accurate and robust forecasting systems that capture the inherent uncertainties and unpredictabilities of the weather. Additionally, the application of neural networks in weather forecasting has also been extended to the realm of climate modeling and prediction. Researchers have used neural networks to analyze and 3 predict long-term climate trends, such as changes in global temperature and sea level rise. These models have been shown to be particularly effective in capturing the complex relationships between climate variables and predicting future climate scenarios. By combining these climate models with traditional weather forecasting systems, researchers believe that they can develop more comprehensive and integrated forecasting systems that capture both the short-term and long-term aspects of the weather and climate. The use of neural networks in weather forecasting has also been explored in the context of ensemble methods and uncertainty quantification. Researchers have found that neural networks can be used to generate ensemble forecasts, which involve combining the predictions of multiple models to produce a single, more accurate forecast. By analyzing the uncertainties and errors associated with each model, researchers believe that they can develop more robust and reliable forecasting systems that capture the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the weather. In another unexpected turn, some researchers have even investigated the use of neural networks to predict weather patterns based on analysis of dreams and subconscious thoughts. The idea behind this approach is that certain dreams and subconscious thoughts may be reflective of unconscious weather-related anxieties and fears, such as the fear of storms or the desire for sunny weather. By analyzing these dreams and subconscious thoughts using neural networks, researchers believe that they can gain insights into the psychological and emotional dimensions of weather and develop more personalized and human-centric forecasting systems. The application of neural networks in weather forecasting has also been extended to the realm of urban planning and management. Researchers have used neural networks to analyze and predict urban weather patterns, such as heat islands and air quality, which are critical factors in urban planning and decision-making. By combining these urban weather models with traditional forecasting systems, researchers believe that they can develop more comprehensive and integrated forecasting systems that capture both the local and global aspects of the weather and climate. Furthermore, the use of neural networks in weather forecasting has also been explored in the context of sustainability and environmental impact. Researchers have found that neural networks can be used to analyze and predict the environmental impacts of weather-related events, such as flooding and droughts. By developing more accurate and robust forecasting systems, researchers believe that they can help mitigate the negative impacts of these events and promote more sustainable and resilient communities. In a somewhat surprising development, some researchers have even investigated the use of neural networks to predict weather patterns based on analysis of fungal growth and mycological trends. The idea behind this approach is that certain types of fungi may be more prevalent during certain types of weather, such as the growth of mushrooms during rainy weather or the spread of fungal diseases during dry weather. By analyzing these mycological trends using neural networks, researchers believe that they can develop more accurate and holistic forecasting systems that capture the intricate relationships between the natural world and the weather. Overall, the field of neural approaches to real-time weather forecasting is rapidly evolving and expanding, with new and innovative methods being developed and explored. While some of these approaches may seem unconventional or even bizarre, they reflect the creativity and imagination of researchers in this field and demonstrate the vast potential of neural networks to revolutionize the way we understand and predict the weather. As researchers continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with neural networks, we can expect to see even more innovative and effective approaches to weather forecasting emerge in the future. 3 Methodology The development of neural approaches to real-time weather forecasting has necessitated a multidisci- plinary approach, combining advances in computer science, meteorology, and data analysis. At the core of this endeavor is the creation of complex algorithms that can interpret and predict weather patterns with high accuracy. To achieve this, we have employed a range of techniques, including deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are particularly adept at analyzing spatial and temporal data respectively. 4 One of the initial steps in our methodology involved the collection and preprocessing of large datasets related to weather patterns. This included historical weather records from various parts of the globe, satellite imagery, and data from weather stations. It was crucial to preprocess this data to ensure it was in a format that could be efficiently analyzed by our neural networks. This involved cleaning the data to remove any inconsistencies or missing values, normalizing it to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model, and transforming it into a suitable format for our neural networks. Following data preparation, we designed and implemented several neural network architectures. The first was a CNN-based model aimed at predicting weather patterns from satellite imagery. This model was trained on a large dataset of satellite images, each labeled with the corresponding weather conditions. The CNN was able to learn features from these images that were indicative of different weather patterns, such as cloud formations and atmospheric conditions. This approach showed promising results, with the model being able to predict weather conditions with a high degree of accuracy. In addition to the CNN model, we also developed an RNN-based model to predict weather patterns over time. This model was trained on historical weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant factors. The RNN was particularly effective at capturing temporal dependencies in the data, allowing it to make accurate predictions of future weather conditions. This model was further enhanced by the incorporation of attention mechanisms, which enabled it to focus on the most relevant input data when making predictions. However, in an unexpected turn, our research also explored the application of chaotic systems theory to weather forecasting. By modeling weather patterns as chaotic systems, we were able to identify certain underlying principles that could be used to make predictions. This involved analyzing the strange attractors that emerged from the complex interactions within the atmosphere and using these to forecast future weather patterns. While this approach may seem unorthodox, it yielded some fascinating results, with certain chaotic models showing a surprising degree of accuracy in their predictions. Furthermore, our investigation into neural approaches to real-time weather forecasting took a peculiar turn when we began to explore the potential of using generative models to create synthetic weather data. By training generative adversarial networks (GANs) on historical weather data, we were able to generate new, realistic weather patterns that could be used to augment our training datasets. This not only helped to increase the diversity of our data but also provided a unique insight into the underlying structures of weather patterns. The synthetic data generated by the GANs was found to be remarkably realistic, with some models even producing patterns that had never been observed before in nature. The integration of these diverse approaches has led to the development of a comprehensive framework for real-time weather forecasting. By combining the strengths of CNNs, RNNs, chaotic systems theory, and generative models, we have created a system that is capable of making highly accurate predictions of weather conditions. This framework is not only robust but also flexible, allowing it to be adapted to various contexts and regions. Moreover, its ability to learn from experience and improve over time makes it an invaluable tool for meteorologists and researchers alike. In another unexpected direction, our research also delved into the realm of quantum computing and its potential applications to weather forecasting. By leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, we explored the possibility of developing quantum algorithms that could solve complex weather forecasting problems more efficiently than classical computers. Although this line of inquiry is still in its infancy, it has already yielded some intriguing results, with certain quantum algorithms showing a significant speedup over their classical counterparts. The implications of this research are profound, suggesting that quantum computing could revolutionize the field of weather forecasting in the not-too-distant future. Despite the progress made, our methodology is not without its challenges and limitations. One of the main hurdles we faced was the issue of data quality and availability. The accuracy of weather forecasts is heavily dependent on the quality of the input data, and any inconsistencies or gaps in the data can significantly impact the model’s performance. Moreover, the collection of certain types of weather data, such as high-resolution satellite imagery, can be expensive and logistically challenging. To address these challenges, we had to develop innovative solutions, including data augmentation techniques and novel sensor systems, to improve the quality and availability of weather data. 5 The complexity of weather systems also poses a significant challenge to our models. Weather patterns are influenced by a myriad of factors, including atmospheric conditions, ocean currents, and terrestrial processes, making it difficult to develop models that can accurately capture these interactions. To overcome this, we have had to develop highly sophisticated models that can account for these complex interactions and make predictions based on a deep understanding of the underlying physics. This has involved the incorporation of advanced techniques, such as ensemble forecasting and model output statistics, to improve the accuracy and reliability of our predictions. In conclusion, our methodology for neural approaches to real-time weather forecasting represents a significant advancement in the field. By combining cutting-edge techniques from computer science and meteorology, we have developed a robust and flexible framework that can make highly accurate predictions of weather conditions. While there are still challenges to be addressed, the potential of this research to improve our understanding of weather patterns and enhance forecasting capabilities is vast. As we continue to refine and expand our methodology, we are confident that it will play an increasingly important role in the field of meteorology, enabling better decision-making and more effective planning in the face of complex and dynamic weather systems. 4 Experiments To investigate the socioeconomic impact of cooperative rainfall insurance, we designed a comprehen- sive experimental framework that integrated both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The study was conducted over a period of two years, covering multiple regions with diverse climatic conditions and socioeconomic profiles. We began by establishing a network of community-based organizations that served as hubs for data collection, participant recruitment, and policy implementa- tion. These organizations played a crucial role in facilitating trust among the local population, which was essential for the success of the experiment. The experimental design involved the creation of multiple treatment groups, each receiving a different variant of the cooperative rainfall insurance policy. The policies varied in terms of premium rates, payout structures, and enrollment requirements, allowing us to assess the sensitivity of outcomes to these parameters. Additionally, a control group was established, consisting of individuals who did not participate in any insurance program, to provide a baseline for comparison. The selection of participants for each group was randomized to minimize biases and ensure that the results could be generalized across different populations. One of the innovative aspects of our approach was the incorporation of a bizarre incentive mechanism, designed to encourage participants to adopt risk-mitigating behaviors. Specifically, we introduced a reward system that offered participants a chance to win a livestock animal of their choice (such as a cow, goat, or chicken) if they achieved a predefined level of compliance with recommended agricultural practices. This approach was based on the hypothesis that the prospect of receiving a tangible, livelihood-enhancing asset would motivate individuals to take proactive steps in managing climate-related risks. While this method may seem unconventional, it was intended to tap into the psychological and social aspects of decision-making, potentially leading to more sustainable and resilient outcomes. The data collection process was multifaceted, involving both survey-based instruments and observa- tional studies. We conducted extensive interviews with participants to gather information on their socioeconomic status, agricultural practices, risk perceptions, and experiences with the insurance program. Furthermore, we implemented a monitoring system to track key indicators such as crop yields, soil health, and water usage patterns. This comprehensive dataset enabled us to evaluate the impact of cooperative rainfall insurance on a wide range of socioeconomic outcomes, including income stability, food security, and social cohesion. To analyze the effectiveness of our experimental interventions, we employed a combination of statistical models and machine learning algorithms. These tools allowed us to identify patterns and correlations within the data, as well as to predict the likelihood of certain outcomes based on a set of input variables. The results of these analyses were then used to refine the design of the insurance policies and to inform the development of supportive programs and services. For instance, we discovered that participants who received training on climate-resilient agriculture were more likely to adopt these practices and, consequently, experienced fewer crop failures and higher incomes. 6 In an effort to further enhance the validity and reliability of our findings, we also conducted a series of focus groups and community workshops. These interactive sessions provided a platform for participants to share their experiences, raise concerns, and suggest improvements to the insurance program. The feedback gathered through these events was invaluable, as it highlighted the importance of community involvement, transparency, and accountability in the design and implementation of cooperative rainfall insurance initiatives. By integrating the perspectives and needs of local stakeholders, we were able to create a more inclusive and responsive framework for managing climate-related risks. The experimental framework also included a component focused on the development of innovative technologies and tools to support the implementation of cooperative rainfall insurance. We collabo- rated with a team of software developers to design a mobile application that enabled participants to access information on weather forecasts, agricultural practices, and insurance policy details. This application also included a feature for reporting crop losses and submitting claims, which streamlined the process and reduced the administrative burden on both participants and program administrators. Furthermore, we explored the use of satellite imagery and remote sensing technologies to monitor crop health and detect early signs of stress, allowing for more timely and targeted interventions. To assess the financial viability of the cooperative rainfall insurance program, we conducted a detailed cost-benefit analysis. This involved estimating the costs associated with program administration, pre- mium collection, and payout disbursement, as well as the benefits accruing to participants in the form of reduced risk, increased incomes, and improved livelihoods. The results of this analysis indicated that the program was financially sustainable, with the benefits exceeding the costs by a significant margin. However, we also identified areas for improvement, such as reducing administrative costs and enhancing the efficiency of payout disbursement. By addressing these challenges, we can further enhance the socioeconomic impact of cooperative rainfall insurance and ensure its long-term viability. In addition to the quantitative aspects of the experiment, we also explored the qualitative dimensions of cooperative rainfall insurance. Through a series of case studies and ethnographic analyses, we examined the social and cultural contexts in which the insurance program was implemented. This involved investigating the role of social networks, community norms, and cultural values in shaping the adoption and effectiveness of the program. The findings from these studies highlighted the importance of considering the local context and adapting the program design to meet the specific needs and preferences of different communities. By doing so, we can create a more nuanced and responsive approach to cooperative rainfall insurance, one that acknowledges the diversity and complexity of human experiences. The experiment also incorporated a unique approach to evaluating the environmental impact of cooperative rainfall insurance. We used a set of ecological indicators, such as soil erosion rates and biodiversity indices, to assess the effects of the program on environmental sustainability. The results showed that participants who adopted climate-resilient agricultural practices experienced significant reductions in soil erosion and improvements in biodiversity, compared to those who did not participate in the program. These findings suggest that cooperative rainfall insurance can have positive environmental externalities, contributing to the conservation of natural resources and the promotion of sustainable agriculture. Overall, the experimental framework provided a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to investigating the socioeconomic impact of cooperative rainfall insurance. By integrating qualitative and quantitative methodologies, incorporating innovative technologies and tools, and considering the environmental and social contexts of program implementation, we were able to gain a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between climate risk, agricultural practices, and livelihood outcomes. The findings from this study have important implications for the design and implementation of cooperative rainfall insurance programs, highlighting the need for a nuanced and adaptive approach that acknowledges the diversity and complexity of huma",,,,,

P108.pdf,"Progress Towards Eliciting Organized Phoneme Structures Abstract Phonological typology, a vital area within linguistic studies, examines the patterns and functions of sounds across the world’s languages. This paper offers an overview of completed and ongoing experiments utilizing phonological representations, derived from typological databases, in speech processing tasks. It primarily focuses on two lines of inquiry motivated by the need to adapt speech technologies to low- resource languages and dialects. Initially, a framework is presented for evaluating the cross-linguistic consistency of phonological characteristics within multilingual phoneme inventories. Subsequently, an outline is given for a method that could potentially contribute to the development of future phoneme inventory induction systems, highlighting the crucial role of phonological typology in this process. 1 Introduction The field of phonological typology investigates the distribution and functionality of sounds in languages globally. Typological databases are instrumental in making generalizations in this domain. These resources are valuable not only for creating probabilistic models of phonological typology but also for enhancing downstream multilingual NLP, speech technology, and language documentation efforts. This paper summarizes our research involving phonological representations in speech processing, utilizing phonological typology databases. Despite the prevalence of end-to-end approaches in automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, and speech-to-speech translation, the integration of precise phonological knowledge remains essential in various scenarios. Our research is driven by the goal of extending speech technologies, which still rely on phonological representations, to under-resourced languages and dialects. We first review a framework designed to analyze the cross-linguistic consistency of phonological features in multilingual phoneme inventories obtained from cross-lingual typological databases. We then propose a preliminary method that may act as a foundational element in a future phoneme inventory induction system, emphasizing the significance of phonological typology in such an approach. 2 Multilingual Phoneme Inventories Traditionally, a phoneme is defined as a theoretical concept specific to a single language. Applying phonemes and their feature encodings across languages presents a challenge: it’s unclear whether all distinctive features (DFs) will be relevant or applicable in a multilingual phoneme inventory taken from a typological database. If DF representations were phonetic instead of phonemic, and acoustic rather than articulatory, one might anticipate a strong correlation between DFs and the acoustic signal. However, in practical multilingual contexts, these representations are frequently influenced by phonemic considerations due to the accessibility of phonemic inventories and transcriptions. Our approach was straightforward: a phonemic contrast is deemed consistent across languages if it can be reliably predicted in a binary classification task on withheld languages. This problem involves a segment of a speech signal and a label (e.g., front vowel vs. back vowel). A classifier is trained on a multilingual, multi-speaker dataset, excluding some languages for later assessment. In cases where cross-linguistic consistency was lacking, we enhanced the method by basing the representation on contextual phonological knowledge provided as DFs, excluding the contrast being tested. Our experiments involved languages from the Dravidian, Indo-European, and Malayo-Polynesian families, with phoneme inventories sourced from a phonological database. The results are varied. An experiment designed to predict contrasts in unvoiced labial consonants between specific languages yielded reliable predictions across languages. Similar consistency was observed for contrasts between front and back vowels, as well as vowel height and continuant manner of articulation distinctions. Negative outcomes include the cross-lingual prediction of retroflex consonants between language families: a predictor trained on Dravidian languages cannot accurately predict retroflex consonants in another language, and vice versa. The detection of aspiration was similarly inconsistent. Incorporating other contrasts as contextual features did not result in significant improvement for these complex cases. Our research is partly motivated by a persistent question: Can this methodology assess the cross- linguistic validity of existing phoneme inventories given available data? For example, among the Malayo-Polynesian languages studied, only one has retroflex consonants, acquired from loanwords from other language families. Different phoneme inventories exist for this language, one of which includes retroflex plosives, while another omits them. Determining which representation is superior in a multilingual pronunciation model remains an open issue. 3 Towards Phonology Induction Our current research efforts are directed towards the induction of phoneme inventories for languages that lack the standard resources needed for speech model training. This task aligns with other work in zero-resource subword modeling. Existing unsupervised methods for discovering acoustic units derive acoustic-phonetic and latent auditory-like representations, but the typological accuracy of these representations is uncertain. Our initial work with ""universal"" multilingual phoneme recognizers was not successful. This was mainly because the limited training data and the lack of language models to guide the search frequently led to unreliable phoneme inventory recovery even for closely related dialects, for instance, in trying to identify the phoneme inventory of one dialect after being exposed to two others. An improved strategy involves incorporating language identification and phonological typology into the phoneme recognizer. Using an accurate language identification model, the phoneme inventories of the most closely related languages can be employed to narrow down the potential phonemic hypotheses for a new, previously unseen language or dialect. We are currently adapting the phonological contrast predictor methods from the previous section for phonology induction tasks. Several approaches for detecting phonemic features in continuous speech are known, some relying solely on signal processing and others that are model-based. At a basic level, the output of such predictors represents speech as parallel, asynchronous streams of articulatory features. More complex models that utilize the structure of articulation, feature geometry, and other correlations between features are also feasible. In these methods, cross-linguistic phonological databases are crucial for not only integrating various features into phonemes but also for validating which combinations of hypothesized phonemes are acceptable based on known phoneme inventories. Furthermore, additional phonological insights from other typological resources can be incorporated if they can be reliably extracted from the speech signal. 2",1,,,,
P109.pdf,"Multimodal Deep Ensemble for Hateful Meme Identification Abstract This paper delves into the utilization of machine learning techniques for identify- ing hate speech, while addressing the persisting technical challenges to enhance their performance to match human-level accuracy. We explore several current visual-linguistic Transformer models and suggest enhancements to boost their ef- fectiveness for this task. The model we propose demonstrates superior performance compared to the established benchmarks, achieving a 5th place ranking out of over 3,100 participants. 1 Introduction This paper addresses the critical influence of the internet on our daily lives, where our online presence showcases our personalities and beliefs, as well as our biases. Daily, billions of individuals engage with various forms of online content, and despite some of this content being valuable and informative, an increasing portion is harmful, including hate speech and misinformation. There is a growing need to quickly detect this content, improve the review process and automate decisions to rapidly remove harmful material, thereby reducing any harm to viewers. Social media platforms are frequently used for interactions, sharing messages and images with private groups and the public. Facebook AI launched a competition to tag hateful memes that include both images and text. For this, a dataset of 10,000+ labeled multimodal memes was provided. The aim of the challenge is to develop an algorithm that identifies multimodal hate speech in memes, while also being robust to their benign alterations. A meme’s hateful nature could stem from its image, text, or both. Benign alteration is a technique used by organizers to switch a meme’s label from hateful to non-hateful, requiring modifications to either the text or the image. The core assessment metric for this binary classification task is the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), representing the area under the ROC curve. This curve plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various classification thresholds. The primary objective is to maximize the AUROC. AUROC = Z 1 0 TPR(T)dFPR(T) (1) Accuracy is the secondary metric, calculating the proportion of instances where the predicted class matches the actual class in the test set. Accuracy = 1 N N X i=1 I(yi = ˆyi) (2) The aim is to maximize both metrics. In brief, this paper makes three contributions: . • We conduct experiments using single-stream and dual-stream architectures such as VL- BERT, VLP, UNITER and LXMERT and compare their performance with the established baselines. These models were chosen because of their pre-training on diverse datasets. • We put forward a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism that connects caption information with meme caption text, which increases performance in detecting hateful memes. This is similar to the cross-attention between images in other research. • We demonstrate that deep ensembles greatly improve single model predictions. 2 Related Work Transformer models pre-trained on extensive datasets have shown state-of-the-art results in numerous language processing tasks. BERT is one of the most popular due to its ease of use and strong performance. Recently, training these large models on combined visual-linguistic embeddings has shown very promising outcomes for visual-linguistic tasks such as visual question answering, reasoning, and image captioning. LXMERT uses dual networks to process text and images, learning cross-modality encoder representations by using a Transformer to combine the two streams of information. The images’ features are derived using a Faster R-CNN feature extractor. This is also used in single-stream architectures, VL-BERT and UNITER, which employ a single Transformer on top of the combined image-text embeddings. A unified model for visual understanding and vision-language tasks has also been proposed. Table 1: Pre-training datasets for each model Books Corpus CC COCO VG SBU GQA VQA 2.0 VG-QA VL-BERT X VLP X X UNITER X X X X LXMERT X X X X X X A dataset for multimodal hate speech detection was created by gathering data from Twitter, using particular hateful keywords. However, studies found that multimodal models did not do better than text-only models. 3 Methodology One goal of this research is to leverage the fact that single and dual stream Transformer models have been pre-trained on a variety of datasets across various fields. Transformer attention models excel at NLP tasks, and the masked language modeling pre-training method in BERT is both powerful and versatile. Studies show that the pre-training process can better align visual-linguistic embeddings and help downstream tasks like visual question answering and reasoning. Given that pre-training a visual-linguistic Transformer architecture is helpful for downstream tasks, might ensembling different models pre-trained on different datasets yield better results? Table 1 shows the pre-training datasets used for each model. 3.1 UNITER with Meme Text and Inferred Caption Cross-Attention The Natural Language for Visual Reasoning for Real (NLVR2) is an academic dataset of human written sentences connected to pairs of photos. The dataset includes pairs of visually intricate images coupled with a statement and a binary label. UNITER was among the top models in this challenge by adding a cross-attention module between text-image pairs, dividing each sample in two and repeating the text. They then apply attention pooling to each sequence, concatenate them and add the classification head, a multi-layer perceptron. Similar to this, we propose to repeat the meme image in each half-sequence and add an inferred meme caption as the second text. We generate captions using the Show and Tell model. This way, the model could learn from both the original meme text and the new captions generated by a model trained on a different dataset. 2 4 Experiments We carry out several experiments using LXMERT, VLP, VL-BERT, and UNITER. We apply bidirec- tional cross-attention using inferred captions for UNITER, VL-BERT, and VLP, but not for LXMERT due to its low performance on the dataset. We also experiment with a dataset from previous research. We filter and balance it down to 16K samples by excluding cartoon memes and memes with little text. We fine-tune VL-BERTLARGE using the reduced dataset for four rounds, then fine-tune it using the hateful memes dataset for another four rounds. The results were lower than the majority of the other models. The baselines for models trained on the Hateful Memes dataset are in Table 2. 5 Results Our best performing solutions are derived from averaging probabilities using a single VL- BERTLARGE and one UNITERLARGE+PA (UNITERLARGE with extra attention). We used the default training parameters of the vanilla pre-trained UNITERLARGE model, but changed the training steps according to the dataset size. A deep ensemble of UNITERLARGE+PA models got the best performance. For this ensemble, we simply rerun training using various random seeds and average the predictions from each model. Table 2 displays the top results for the final competition phase as well as the improvements cross-attention brings to the UNITER model in the first phase. The final results are significantly better than the baselines. The most important findings are as follows: • Single-stream Transformer models pre-trained on the Conceptual Captions (CC) dataset give the best results, and deep ensembles improve the overall performance further. The choice of pre-training datasets matters in terms of domain similarity to the fine-tuning dataset. • We believe that UNITER gets better results due to being pre-trained on the COCO dataset which has less noise. Similarly to the Hateful Memes dataset this is also high quality. Further work should investigate if pre-training VL-BERT on COCO would improve its results. • Interestingly, the paired attention technique only works for UNITER and not for the other models. • Training large models from scratch did poorly, which is expected due to the small dataset size. • The dataset of multimodal hate speech is heavily skewed towards hateful text and the keywords used to collect it. The memes are less subtle compared to the ones in the Hateful Memes dataset, although they are perhaps more typical of what is seen online. 6 Conclusion We present effective techniques to detect hate speech in a distinct dataset of multimodal memes from Facebook AI. The aim is to identify hate speech using a multimodal model, and to be robust to the “benign confounders” that cause the binary label of a meme to change. We have performed tests on various large pre-trained Transformer models and fine-tuned state-of-the- art single-stream models like VL-BERT, VLP, and UNITER, and dual-stream models like LXMERT. We compare their performance against the baselines, showing that the single-stream models perform significantly better. Our choice for these models stems from their pre-training on a wide variety of datasets from different fields. We also adapt a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism that links caption information with meme text. This leads to increased accuracy in identifying hateful memes. Furthermore, deep ensembles can improve single model predictions. Training the models from scratch performed poorly due to the small dataset size. We also observed that the pre-training dataset influences results. We conclude that despite the improvements in multimodal models, there is still a gap when comparing to human performance. This suggests considerable scope for the development of better algorithms for multimodal understanding. 3 Table 2: Baselines from previous research.

P110.pdf,"LIDA: Lightweight Interactive Dialogue Annotator Abstract Dialogue systems are highly dependent on the quality of the data used to train them. It is therefore important to develop good dialogue annotation tools which can improve the speed and quality of dialogue data annotation. With this in mind, we introduce LIDA, an annotation tool designed specifically for conversation data. As far as we know, LIDA is the first dialogue annotation system that handles the entire dialogue annotation pipeline from raw text, as may be the output of transcription services, to structured conversation data. Furthermore it supports the integration of arbitrary machine learning models as annotation recommenders and also has a dedicated interface to resolve inter-annotator disagreements such as after crowdsourcing annotations for a dataset. LIDA is fully open source, documented and publicly available. 1 Introduction Dialogue systems are becoming one of the most active research areas in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). Creating a high-quality dialogue dataset incurs a large annotation cost, which makes good dialogue annotation tools essential to ensure the highest possible quality. Many annotation tools exist for a range of NLP tasks but none are designed specifically for dialogue with modern usability principles in mind. LIDA is a web application designed to make dialogue dataset creation and annotation as easy and fast as possible. In addition to following modern principles of usability, LIDA integrates best practices from other state-of-the-art annotation tools, most importantly by allowing arbitrary ML models to be integrated as annotation recommenders to suggest annotations for data. Any system with the correct API can be integrated into LIDA’s back end, meaning LIDA can be used as a front end for researchers to interact with their dialogue systems and correct their responses, then save the interaction as a future test case. When data is crowdsourced, it is good practice to have multiple annotators label each piece of data to reduce noise and mislabelling. Once you have multiple annotations, it is important to be able to resolve conflicts by highlighting where annotators disagreed so that an arbiter can decide on the correct annotation. To this end, LIDA provides a dedicated interface which automatically finds where annotators have disagreed and displays the labels alongside a percentage of how many annotators selected each label, with the majority annotated labels selected by default. 1.1 Main Contributions Our main contributions with this tool are: • A modern annotation tool designed specifically for task-oriented conversation data • The first dialogue annotator capable of handling the full dialogue annotation pipeline from turn and dialogue segmentation through to labelling structured conversation data • Easy integration of dialogue systems and recommenders to provide annotation suggestions • A dedicated interface to resolve inter-annotator disagreements for dialogue data 2 Related Work Various annotation tools have been developed for NLP tasks in recent years. Table 1 compares LIDA with other recent annotation tools. TWIST is a dialogue annotation tool which consists of two stages: turn segmentation and content feature annotation. Turn segmentation allows users to highlight and create new turn segments from raw text. After this, users can annotate sections of text in a segment by highlighting them and selecting from a predefined feature list. However, this tool doesn’t allow users to specify custom annotations or labels and doesn’t support classification or slot-value annotation. INCEpTION is a semantic annotation platform for interactive tasks that require semantic resources like entity linking. It provides machine learning models to suggest annotations and allows users to collect and model knowledge directly in the tool. GATE is an Table 1: Annotator Tool Comparison Table Annotation Tool Turn/Dialogue Segmentation Classification Labels Edit Dialogues/Turns Recommenders Inter-Annotator Disagreement Resolut LIDA YES YES YES YES YES INCEpTION NO YES NO YES YES/NO GATE NO YES NO NO YES/NO TWIST YES NO YES NO NO BRAT NO YES NO YES NO DOCCANO NO YES NO NO NO DialogueView YES YES YES NO NO open source tool that provides predefined solutions for many text processing tasks. It is powerful because it allows annotators to enhance the provided annotation tools with their own Java code, making it easily extensible and provides an enormous number of predefined features. However, GATE is a large and complicated tool with a significant setup cost. Despite their large feature sets, INCEpTION and GATE are not designed for annotating dialogue and cannot display data as turns, an important feature for dialogue datasets. BRAT and Doccano are web-based annotation tools for tasks such as text classification and sequence labeling. They have intuitive and user-friendly interfaces which aim to make the creation of certain types of dataset such as classification or sequence labelling datasets as fast as possible. BRAT also supports annotation suggestions by integrating ML models. However, like INCEpTION and GATE, they are not designed for annotating dialogues and do not support generation of formatted conversational data from a raw text file such as may be output by a transcription service. LIDA aims to fill these gaps by providing a lightweight, easy-to-setup annotation tool which displays data as a series of dialogues, supports integration of arbitrary ML models as recommenders and supports segmentation of raw text into dialogues and turns. DialogueView is a tool for dialogue annotation. However, the main use-cases are not focused on building dialogue systems, rather it is focused on segmenting recorded conversations. It supports annotating audio files as well as discourse segmentation - hence, granular labelling of the dialogue, recommenders, inter-annotator agreement, and slot-value labelling is not possible with DialogueView. 3 System Overview LIDA is built according to a client-server architecture with the front end written in standard web languages (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) that will run on any browser. The back end written in Python using the Flask web framework as a RESTful API. The main screen which lists all available dialogues. The buttons below this list allow a user to add a blank or formatted dialogue file. Users can also drag and drop files in this screen to upload them. The user is then able to add, delete or edit any particular dialogue. There is also a button to download the whole dataset as a JSON file on this page. Clicking on a dialogue will take users to the individual dialogue annotation screen. LIDA uses the concept of a “turn” to organise how a dialogue is displayed and recorded. A turn consists of a query by the user followed by a response from the system, with an unlimited number of labels allowed for each user query. The user query and system response are displayed in the large area on the left of the interface, while the labels for each turn are shown in the scrollable box on the right. There are two forms that these labels can currently take which are particularly relevant for dialogue: multilabel classification and slot-value pair. An example of multilabel classification is whether the user was informing the system or requesting a piece of information. An example of a slot-value pair is whether the user mentioned the type of restaurant they’d like to eat at (slot: restaurant-type) and if so what it was (value: italian, for example). The front-end code is written in a modular form so that it is easy for researchers 3.0.1 Experimenting with Dialogue Systems LIDA is designed with this in mind - a dialogue system can be integrated into the back end so that it will run whenever the user enters a new query in the front end. The user will then be able to evaluate whether the system gave the correct answer and correct the labels it gets wrong using the front end. LIDA will record these corrections and allow the user to download the interaction with their dialogue system with the corrected labels so that it can be used as a test case in future versions of the system. 3.0.2 Creating a New Dialogue Dataset Users can create a blank dialogue on LIDA’s home screen, then enter queries in the box shown at the bottom of the screen. Along with whole dialogue systems, arbitrary ML models can be added as recommenders in the back end. Once the user hits ""Enter"", the query is run through the recommender models in the back end and the suggested annotations displayed for the label. If no recommender is specified in the back end, the label will be left blank. Users can delete turns and navigate between them using 2 ""Enter"" or the arrow keys. The name of the dialogue being annotated can be seen next to the ""Back"" button at the top left of the screen and can be edited by clicking on it. 3.0.3 Annotating An Existing Dataset Datasets can be uploaded via drag-and-drop to the home screen of the system, or paths can be specified in the back end if the system were being used for crowdsourcing. Datasets can be in one of two forms, either a "".txt"" file such as may be produced by a transcription service, or a formatted "".json"" file, a common format for dialogue data. Once the user has uploaded their data, their dialogue(s) will appear on the home screen. The user can click on each dialogue and will be taken to the single dialogue annotation screen to annotate it. If the user uploaded a text file, they will be taken to a dialogue and turn segmentation screen. Following the same constraints imposed in previous works, this turn segmenter assumes that there are only two participants in the dialogue: the user and the system, and that the user asks the first query. The user separates each utterance in the dialogue by a blank line, and separates dialogues with a triple equals sign (""===""). Once the user clicks ""Done"", the text file will automatically be parsed into the correct JSON format and each query run through the recommenders in the back-end to obtain annotation suggestions. 3.0.4 Resolving Annotator Disagreement Researchers could use LIDA’s main interface to crowdsource annotations for a dialogue dataset. Once they have several annotations for each dialogue, they can upload these to the inter-annotator resolution interface of LIDA. The disagreements between annotators will be detected, with a percentage shown beside each label to show how many annotators selected it. The label with the highest percentage of selections is checked by default. The arbiter can accept the majority label simply by pressing ""Enter"" and can change errors with the arrow keys to facilitate fast resolution. This interface also displays an averaged (over turns) version of Cohen’s Kappa, the total number of annotations, the total number of errors, and the averaged (over turns) accuracy. 3.1 Features Specifying Custom Labels LIDA’s configuration is controlled by a single script in the back end. This script defines which labels will be displayed in the UI and is easy to extend. Users can define their own labels by altering this configuration script. If a user wishes to add a new label, all they need to do is specify the label’s name, its type (classification or slot-value pair, currently) and the possible values the classification can take. Alongside the label specification, they can also specify a recommender to use for the label values. The label will then automatically be displayed in the front end. Note that labels in uploaded datasets will only be displayed if the label has an entry in the configuration file. Custom Recommenders When creating a dialogue dataset from scratch, LIDA is most powerful when used in conjunction with recommenders which can suggest annotations for user queries to be corrected by the annotator. State-of-the-art tools emphasize the importance of being able to use recommenders in annotation systems. Users can specify arbitrary ML models to use for each label in LIDA’s back end. The back end is written in Python, the de facto language for machine learning, so researchers can directly integrate models written in Python to the back end. This is in contrast to tools such as INCEpTION and GATE which are written in Java and so require extra steps to integrate a Python-based model. To integrate a recommender, the user simply provides an instantiated Python object in the configuration file that has a method called ""transform"" that takes a single string and returns a predicted label. Dialogue and Turn Segmentation from Raw Data When uploading a .txt file, users can segment each utterance and each dialogue with a simple interface. This means that raw dialogue data with no labels, such as obtained from a transcription service, can be uploaded and processed into a labelled dialogue. Segmented dialogues and turns are automatically run through every recommender to give suggested labels for each utterance. 4 Evaluation To test LIDA’s capabilities, we designed a simple experiment: we took a bespoke dataset of 154 dialogues with an average of 3.5 turns per dialogue and a standard deviation of 1.55. The task was to assign three classification labels to each user utterance in each dialogue. Each annotator was given a time limit of 1 hour and told to annotate as many dialogues as they could in that time. We had six annotators perform this task, three of whom were familiar with the system and three of whom had never seen it before. These annotators annotated an average of 79 dialogues in one hour with a standard deviation of 30, which corresponds to an average of 816.5 individual annotations. The annotators who had never seen the system before annotated an average of 60 dialogues corresponding to an average of 617 individual annotations. Once we had these six annotations, we performed a second experiment whereby a single arbiter resolved inter-annotator disagree- ments. In one hour, the arbiter resolved 350 disagreements and noted that resolution. 3 ",0,,,,
P111.pdf,"Learning Genomic Sequence Representations using Graph Neural Networks over De Bruijn Graphs Abstract The rapid increase of genomic sequence data requires new methods for creating ro- bust sequence representations. Existing techniques often neglect detailed structural information, focusing mainly on contextual information. We addressed this issue by developing k-mer embeddings that combine contextual and structural string information, by enriching De Bruijn graphs with structural similarity connections. We also crafted a self-supervised method using Contrastive Learning, employing a heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network encoder and constructing positive pairs based on node similarities. Our embeddings consistently outperform prior methods for Edit Distance Approximation and Closest String Retrieval tasks. 1 Introduction Genomic sequence data is growing at an unprecedented rate, requiring the development of novel methods that can provide both accurate and scalable sequence representations. These representations are essential for various computational biology tasks, including gene prediction and multiple sequence alignment. Methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as Word2Vec and Transformers, have been adopted to improve the representation of genomic sequences. These NLP-based approaches are effective at capturing the context within a sequence, which is important because the semantics of words often outweigh their precise letters. Character-level n-gram models might be used to capture structural nuances. However, a uniform representation of each n-gram across all sequences can oversimplify the problem. Applying techniques like transformer-based models on n-grams can escalate computational demands. Consequently, these methods may overlook nuanced k-mer variations important for understanding single-nucleotide polymorphisms and other minor sequence changes. These SNPs can influence disease susceptibility, phenotypic traits, and drug responses. Therefore, we developed a k-mer embedding approach that combines metagenomic context and string structure. In our method, contextual information refers to the relationships between k-mers closely situated within sequences, and structural information examines nucleotide patterns within a k-mer and their relations to other k-mers. We constructed a metagenomic graph that builds upon the De Bruijn Graph to capture k-mer transitions and structural similarities. Given the advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we grounded our method in GNNs but designed for heterogeneous graphs. This approach effectively recognizes and uses both contextual and structural connection types. Drawing from the success of self-supervised pre-training in NLP and Computer Vision, we designed a self-supervised objective for genomic graph data. We employed contrastive loss aiming to align k-mers with similar context and structure in representation space. Finally, we tested our technique on two downstream tasks: Edit Distance Approximation and Closest String Retrieval. The former estimates the minimum changes needed to transform one genomic sequence into another, avoiding quadratic computational complexity. The latter task, Closest String Retrieval, involves finding sequences similar to a query. . 2 Related Work 2.1 Genomic Sequence Representation Machine learning methods have emerged in computational biology to represent genomic sequences. A key component is the k-mer: a continuous nucleotide sequence of length k. The Word2Vec method, which represents words as vectors using their context, treats overlapping k-mers in genomic sequences as words in sentences. Building on this, kmer2vec was introduced to apply Word2Vec to genomic data for Multiple Sequence Alignment. Another strategy is to use the De Bruijn graph, where k-mers are nodes and their overlaps are edges, in conjunction with Node2Vec, which derives node features from the contextual information of biased random walks. This method underpins GRaDL for early animal genome disease detection. K-mers also pair well with transformer-based models: DNABERT leverages a BERT-inspired objective and k-mer tokenization to predict genome-wide regulatory elements. Metagenome2Vec blends Node2Vec with transformers to analyze metagenomes with limited labeled data. Given the high computational demands of these transformer-based approaches, they are outside the scope of our benchmarks in this study. 2.2 Graph Neural Networks Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are foundational to several innovations in graph-based machine learning. In genomics, GNNs have been applied in metagenomic binning. Because we aim to enhance our node embeddings with structural similarity, both heterogeneity and heterophily are key considerations. Recognizing the ubiquity of heterogeneity in real-world graphs, Relational GCNs (R-GCNs) were developed. These networks expand upon GCNs by generalizing the convolution operation to handle different edge types. To tackle heterophily, where distant nodes in a graph may bear similar features, Geom-GCN maps nodes to a latent space, while another approach suggests a distinct encoding approach for node embeddings and neighborhood aggregations. 2.3 Self-Supervised Learning Self-supervised learning (SSL) enables effective use of unlabeled data and reduces dependence on annotated labels. Among SSL methods, contrastive learning has made a significant impact. At its core, contrastive learning seeks to bring similar data instances closer in the embedding space while pushing dissimilar ones apart. When applied to graph data, several techniques have been proposed for obtaining positive pairs, including uniform sampling, node dropping, and random walk sampling. 3 Methodology 3.1 Metagenomic Graph The De Bruijn Graph, which is created from metagenomic sequences, forms the basis of our method. In this graph, each k-mer, a substring of length k from the sequences, is represented by a different node. An edge from node vi to node vj in the graph indicates that the k-mer at node vi directly precedes the k-mer at node vj in one of the sequences of the metagenome. When used, edge weights represent the frequency of these transitions, capturing genomic structures within the graph. Although Node2Vec captures the sequential context in De Bruijn graphs, it overlooks structural k-mer similarities. To address this, we expand the graph to include connections based on these similarities. We formulate two edge types for our graph, where nodes vi, vj, ... represent k-mers. De Bruijn Graph’s edges The first edge type is designed to capture contextual information. Let T(vi, vj) be the count of transitions between k-mers within a dataset of genomic sequences. The weight of an edge connecting nodes vi and vj, w(dBG) ij , is defined by, w(dBG) ij = T (vi,vj) P vk∈δ+(vi) T (vi,vk) where δ+(vi) denotes nodes adjacent to vi via outgoing edges. 2 Sub-k-mer Frequency edges To capture the structural similarity between strings, we introduce a method using sub-k-mer frequency vectors, denoted as y(KFsub_k). This vector quantifies the occurrences of each sub-k-mer of length sub_k within a given k-mer. The i-th entry indicates the frequency of the i-th sub-k-mer, y(KFsub_k)[i] = Pk−sub_k+1 j=1 I[kmer[j : j + sub_k −1] = si]∀si, s ∈Psub_k The k-mer similarity is determined by the cosine similarity between the sub-k-mer frequency vectors, w (KFsub_k) ij = y (KFsub_k) i T y (KFsub_k) j ||y (KFsub_k) i ||2||y (KFsub_k) j ||2 This method, scaling linearly with the frequency vector size per weight, provides a computational advantage over the direct Edit Distance calculation for k-mers. We apply edge-filtering at threshold t, retaining only the links with the highest similarity. The filtered set of weights is then, W (KFsub_k) = {w (KFsub_k) ij |w (KFsub_k) ij ≥t} To accommodate graphs for larger k values, we have developed a more scalable approximation of the above approach. It utilizes approximate nearest neighbor search on the sub-k-mer frequency vectors, which replaces the computationally demanding pairwise cosine similarity calculations. The metagenomic graph is defined as G = (V, E, W). Nodes V correspond to individual k-mers. The edges E can be categorized into two sets: De Bruijn Graphs’s edges E(dBG) and Sub-k-mer Frequency edges E(KF ). Edges in E(KF ) may be further subdivided based on various sub_k values. Edge weights W can contain W (dBG) and several W (KFsub_k). 3.2 Encoder We tailored GNNs for a heterogeneous metagenomic graph to capture nuanced k-mer relationships. The design employs varying depths of message passing: deeper for De Bruijn edges to capture broader context and shallower for similarity measures. Central to this GNN is the adapted Graph Convolutional Layer, formulated as: H(l+1) = σ( ˜D(edge_type)−1 2 ˜W (edge_type) ˜D(edge_type)−1 2 H(l)Θ(l)) where ˜W (edge_type) includes added self-loops and ˜Dii is its diagonal degree matrix. The term edge_type refers to either dBG or KFsub_k. The GCN layout consists of multiple layers, each characterized by a unique edge feature type and the number of channels. 3.3 Self-Supervised Task We use a contrastive learning method for k-mer representations. Graph nodes are initialized using a sub-k-mer frequency vector. Positive and negative pairs are sampled and, along with the k-mer representations from the encoder, are used to compute the loss. Biased Random Walk Sampling We employ Biased Random Walk Sampling to capture k-mer contextual information. This approach uses w(dBG) edges to conduct walks, implemented exactly as in Node2Vec. Given a walk of a set length, we extract positive pairs by applying a window of size m. Using a shrink factor δ, drawn uniformly from 1, ..., m, we determine the range i ± δ within which nodes are considered positive pairs to node vi. Repeating this across multiple random walks, we gather a comprehensive set of positive pairs. Structural Similarity Sampling To capture the structural notion of k-mers, we sample pairs with probability proportional to sub-k-mer frequency similarity, w(KFsub_k). The goal is for k-mers linked by higher similarity to have similar representations. The probability of sampling is given by, P(vi, vj) ∝w (KFsub_k) ij Negative Sampling We randomly select negative pairs from all node pairs in the graph, leveraging the assumption that most pairs lack a high similarity edge. This approach ensures diversity in learned representations. 3 Loss Function Having established both positive (Ppos) and negative (Pneg) pair types, we apply the contrastive loss function. Using σ(x) as the sigmoid function, the loss function is: lij = −log(σ(zT i zj)) −P (vi,vl)∈Pneg log(1 −σ(zT i zl)) To reduce memory usage, we employed Neighborhood Sampling for mini-batching during training. 4 Bioinformatics Tasks 4.1 Edit Distance Approximation The task is to calculate the edit distance without quadratic complexity. The NeuroSEED framework offers a solution using sequence representations trained on a ground truth set of edit distances. In our approach, we began with sequence representations derived from k-mer embeddings and fine-tuned them with a single linear layer. Our experiments were tested against One-Hot encoding (for k = 1), Word2Vec, and Node2Vec. To find optimal hyperparameters, we executed a grid search on the validation set. Based on previous work, we used the hyperbolic function. Our primary metric for evaluation was the percentage Root Mean Squared Error (percent RMSE), where l denotes the dataset’s maximum sequence length, h represents the hyperbolic distance function, and fθ indicates the downstream model, %RMSE(D) = 100 l qP s1,s2∈D(EditDistance(s1, s2) −h(fθ(s1), fθ(s2)))2 4.2 Closest String Retrieval The task is to find the sequence from a reference set that is closest to a query. We assessed embeddings fine-tuned on the edit distance approximation task using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These embeddings were contrasted with ones directly derived from our Self-supervised method, One-Hot, Word2Vec, or Node2Vec, through concatenation or taking the mean of k-mer embeddings. For performance assessment, we used top-n percent accuracies, measuring how often the actual sequence appears within the top n percent of positions based on the closeness of embedding vectors in hyperbolic space. We selected the optimal model for the embeddings based on the validation loss observed for the previous Edit Distance task. 5 Results and Analysis In all our experiments, the memory requirements of the One-Hot method increased exponentially, leading to its exclusion from our results for k > 7. When pre-training exclusively on the training set, our method, thanks to the GCN encoder, can generalize beyond k-mers present in the training set. In contrast, Node2Vec and Word2Vec can only handle k-mer sizes up to the diversity of the training dataset. Therefore, for k > 6, where the test set introduces new k-mers, we excluded these methods. 5.1 Edit Distance Approximation Table 1 presents the results obtained by using our pre-trained embeddings to estimate edit distances between sequences on the RT988 and Qiita datasets. For the RT988 dataset, our Contrastive Learning (CL) and Node2Vec techniques surpassed Word2Vec and One-Hot. The increased losses in Qiita highlight its greater complexity. In this context, our method’s integration of k-mer structural similarity becomes even more beneficial, outperforming all other tested methods. This benefit becomes more evident as k increases, underscoring our embedding’s capability to adapt to new nodes. 5.2 Closest String Retrieval Tables 2a and 2b present the performance of our zero-shot sequence embeddings, directly derived from the aggregation of our k-mer embeddings, in retrieving the nearest sequences in the Qiita dataset. The tables also showcase a comparison with the embeddings that were specifically fine-tuned for the Edit Distance Task. 4 For direct k-mer aggregation, our Contrastive Learning (CL) embeddings are obtained through concatenation, while for k-mer aggregation with One-Hot, Word2Vec, and Node2Vec, we report the results of the better performing method, either concatenation or averaging. The superior zero-shot non-parametric retrieval performance of our CL method emphasizes the combined utility of both context and structural similarity during self-supervised pre-training. Notably, while k-mers of size around three are optimal for Top 1 percent retrieval, larger k-mers excel in the Top 10 percent metrics. This suggests that smaller k-mers are better at discerning local sequence distances, while larger ones capture broader sequence distances. For embeddings fine-tuned using CNNs for Edit Distance Approximation, the complexity of CNNs obscures differences between the embeddings. Our method based solely on zero-shot concatenated k- mer embeddings outperforms this complex fine-tuning. This shows the advantage of our embeddings over the method by previous work. 6 Conclusion In our study, we introduced a novel k-mer embedding technique that seamlessly integrates metage- nomic contextual and structural nuances, achieved through the enhancement of the De Bruijn graph and the use of contrastive learning. In the Edit Distance Approximation task, our technique con- sistently demonstrated superior performance compared to One-Hot, Word2Vec, and Node2Vec. Moreover, without requiring any downstream fine-tuning, our aggregated k-mer embeddings outper- formed the prior method in the Closest String Retrieval task. These findings suggest potential broader uses in computational biology. 5",1,,,,
P112.pdf,"Learning Genomic Sequence Representations using Graph Neural Networks over De Bruijn Graphs Abstract The rapid increase of genomic sequence data requires new methods for creating ro- bust sequence representations. Existing techniques often neglect detailed structural information, focusing mainly on contextual information. We addressed this issue by developing k-mer embeddings that combine contextual and structural string information, by enriching De Bruijn graphs with structural similarity connections. We also crafted a self-supervised method using Contrastive Learning, employing a heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network encoder and constructing positive pairs based on node similarities. Our embeddings consistently outperform prior methods for Edit Distance Approximation and Closest String Retrieval tasks. 1 Introduction Genomic sequence data is growing at an unprecedented rate, requiring the development of novel methods that can provide both accurate and scalable sequence representations. These representations are essential for various computational biology tasks, including gene prediction and multiple sequence alignment. Methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as Word2Vec and Transformers, have been adopted to improve the representation of genomic sequences. These NLP-based approaches are effective at capturing the context within a sequence, which is important because the semantics of words often outweigh their precise letters. Character-level n-gram models might be used to capture structural nuances. However, a uniform representation of each n-gram across all sequences can oversimplify the problem. Applying techniques like transformer-based models on n-grams can escalate computational demands. Consequently, these methods may overlook nuanced k-mer variations important for understanding single-nucleotide polymorphisms and other minor sequence changes. These SNPs can influence disease susceptibility, phenotypic traits, and drug responses. Therefore, we developed a k-mer embedding approach that combines metagenomic context and string structure. In our method, contextual information refers to the relationships between k-mers closely situated within sequences, and structural information examines nucleotide patterns within a k-mer and their relations to other k-mers. We constructed a metagenomic graph that builds upon the De Bruijn Graph to capture k-mer transitions and structural similarities. Given the advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we grounded our method in GNNs but designed for heterogeneous graphs. This approach effectively recognizes and uses both contextual and structural connection types. Drawing from the success of self-supervised pre-training in NLP and Computer Vision, we designed a self-supervised objective for genomic graph data. We employed contrastive loss aiming to align k-mers with similar context and structure in representation space. Finally, we tested our technique on two downstream tasks: Edit Distance Approximation and Closest String Retrieval. The former estimates the minimum changes needed to transform one genomic sequence into another, avoiding quadratic computational complexity. The latter task, Closest String Retrieval, involves finding sequences similar to a query. . 2 Related Work 2.1 Genomic Sequence Representation Machine learning methods have emerged in computational biology to represent genomic sequences. A key component is the k-mer: a continuous nucleotide sequence of length k. The Word2Vec method, which represents words as vectors using their context, treats overlapping k-mers in genomic sequences as words in sentences. Building on this, kmer2vec was introduced to apply Word2Vec to genomic data for Multiple Sequence Alignment. Another strategy is to use the De Bruijn graph, where k-mers are nodes and their overlaps are edges, in conjunction with Node2Vec, which derives node features from the contextual information of biased random walks. This method underpins GRaDL for early animal genome disease detection. K-mers also pair well with transformer-based models: DNABERT leverages a BERT-inspired objective and k-mer tokenization to predict genome-wide regulatory elements. Metagenome2Vec blends Node2Vec with transformers to analyze metagenomes with limited labeled data. Given the high computational demands of these transformer-based approaches, they are outside the scope of our benchmarks in this study. 2.2 Graph Neural Networks Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are foundational to several innovations in graph-based machine learning. In genomics, GNNs have been applied in metagenomic binning. Because we aim to enhance our node embeddings with structural similarity, both heterogeneity and heterophily are key considerations. Recognizing the ubiquity of heterogeneity in real-world graphs, Relational GCNs (R-GCNs) were developed. These networks expand upon GCNs by generalizing the convolution operation to handle different edge types. To tackle heterophily, where distant nodes in a graph may bear similar features, Geom-GCN maps nodes to a latent space, while another approach suggests a distinct encoding approach for node embeddings and neighborhood aggregations. 2.3 Self-Supervised Learning Self-supervised learning (SSL) enables effective use of unlabeled data and reduces dependence on annotated labels. Among SSL methods, contrastive learning has made a significant impact. At its core, contrastive learning seeks to bring similar data instances closer in the embedding space while pushing dissimilar ones apart. When applied to graph data, several techniques have been proposed for obtaining positive pairs, including uniform sampling, node dropping, and random walk sampling. 3 Methodology 3.1 Metagenomic Graph The De Bruijn Graph, which is created from metagenomic sequences, forms the basis of our method. In this graph, each k-mer, a substring of length k from the sequences, is represented by a different node. An edge from node vi to node vj in the graph indicates that the k-mer at node vi directly precedes the k-mer at node vj in one of the sequences of the metagenome. When used, edge weights represent the frequency of these transitions, capturing genomic structures within the graph. Although Node2Vec captures the sequential context in De Bruijn graphs, it overlooks structural k-mer similarities. To address this, we expand the graph to include connections based on these similarities. We formulate two edge types for our graph, where nodes vi, vj, ... represent k-mers. De Bruijn Graph’s edges The first edge type is designed to capture contextual information. Let T(vi, vj) be the count of transitions between k-mers within a dataset of genomic sequences. The weight of an edge connecting nodes vi and vj, w(dBG) ij , is defined by, w(dBG) ij = T (vi,vj) P vk∈δ+(vi) T (vi,vk) where δ+(vi) denotes nodes adjacent to vi via outgoing edges. 2 Sub-k-mer Frequency edges To capture the structural similarity between strings, we introduce a method using sub-k-mer frequency vectors, denoted as y(KFsub_k). This vector quantifies the occurrences of each sub-k-mer of length sub_k within a given k-mer. The i-th entry indicates the frequency of the i-th sub-k-mer, y(KFsub_k)[i] = Pk−sub_k+1 j=1 I[kmer[j : j + sub_k −1] = si]∀si, s ∈Psub_k The k-mer similarity is determined by the cosine similarity between the sub-k-mer frequency vectors, w (KFsub_k) ij = y (KFsub_k) i T y (KFsub_k) j ||y (KFsub_k) i ||2||y (KFsub_k) j ||2 This method, scaling linearly with the frequency vector size per weight, provides a computational advantage over the direct Edit Distance calculation for k-mers. We apply edge-filtering at threshold t, retaining only the links with the highest similarity. The filtered set of weights is then, W (KFsub_k) = {w (KFsub_k) ij |w (KFsub_k) ij ≥t} To accommodate graphs for larger k values, we have developed a more scalable approximation of the above approach. It utilizes approximate nearest neighbor search on the sub-k-mer frequency vectors, which replaces the computationally demanding pairwise cosine similarity calculations. The metagenomic graph is defined as G = (V, E, W). Nodes V correspond to individual k-mers. The edges E can be categorized into two sets: De Bruijn Graphs’s edges E(dBG) and Sub-k-mer Frequency edges E(KF ). Edges in E(KF ) may be further subdivided based on various sub_k values. Edge weights W can contain W (dBG) and several W (KFsub_k). 3.2 Encoder We tailored GNNs for a heterogeneous metagenomic graph to capture nuanced k-mer relationships. The design employs varying depths of message passing: deeper for De Bruijn edges to capture broader context and shallower for similarity measures. Central to this GNN is the adapted Graph Convolutional Layer, formulated as: H(l+1) = σ( ˜D(edge_type)−1 2 ˜W (edge_type) ˜D(edge_type)−1 2 H(l)Θ(l)) where ˜W (edge_type) includes added self-loops and ˜Dii is its diagonal degree matrix. The term edge_type refers to either dBG or KFsub_k. The GCN layout consists of multiple layers, each characterized by a unique edge feature type and the number of channels. 3.3 Self-Supervised Task We use a contrastive learning method for k-mer representations. Graph nodes are initialized using a sub-k-mer frequency vector. Positive and negative pairs are sampled and, along with the k-mer representations from the encoder, are used to compute the loss. Biased Random Walk Sampling We employ Biased Random Walk Sampling to capture k-mer contextual information. This approach uses w(dBG) edges to conduct walks, implemented exactly as in Node2Vec. Given a walk of a set length, we extract positive pairs by applying a window of size m. Using a shrink factor δ, drawn uniformly from 1, ..., m, we determine the range i ± δ within which nodes are considered positive pairs to node vi. Repeating this across multiple random walks, we gather a comprehensive set of positive pairs. Structural Similarity Sampling To capture the structural notion of k-mers, we sample pairs with probability proportional to sub-k-mer frequency similarity, w(KFsub_k). The goal is for k-mers linked by higher similarity to have similar representations. The probability of sampling is given by, P(vi, vj) ∝w (KFsub_k) ij Negative Sampling We randomly select negative pairs from all node pairs in the graph, leveraging the assumption that most pairs lack a high similarity edge. This approach ensures diversity in learned representations. 3 Loss Function Having established both positive (Ppos) and negative (Pneg) pair types, we apply the contrastive loss function. Using σ(x) as the sigmoid function, the loss function is: lij = −log(σ(zT i zj)) −P (vi,vl)∈Pneg log(1 −σ(zT i zl)) To reduce memory usage, we employed Neighborhood Sampling for mini-batching during training. 4 Bioinformatics Tasks 4.1 Edit Distance Approximation The task is to calculate the edit distance without quadratic complexity. The NeuroSEED framework offers a solution using sequence representations trained on a ground truth set of edit distances. In our approach, we began with sequence representations derived from k-mer embeddings and fine-tuned them with a single linear layer. Our experiments were tested against One-Hot encoding (for k = 1), Word2Vec, and Node2Vec. To find optimal hyperparameters, we executed a grid search on the validation set. Based on previous work, we used the hyperbolic function. Our primary metric for evaluation was the percentage Root Mean Squared Error (percent RMSE), where l denotes the dataset’s maximum sequence length, h represents the hyperbolic distance function, and fθ indicates the downstream model, %RMSE(D) = 100 l qP s1,s2∈D(EditDistance(s1, s2) −h(fθ(s1), fθ(s2)))2 4.2 Closest String Retrieval The task is to find the sequence from a reference set that is closest to a query. We assessed embeddings fine-tuned on the edit distance approximation task using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These embeddings were contrasted with ones directly derived from our Self-supervised method, One-Hot, Word2Vec, or Node2Vec, through concatenation or taking the mean of k-mer embeddings. For performance assessment, we used top-n percent accuracies, measuring how often the actual sequence appears within the top n percent of positions based on the closeness of embedding vectors in hyperbolic space. We selected the optimal model for the embeddings based on the validation loss observed for the previous Edit Distance task. 5 Results and Analysis In all our experiments, the memory requirements of the One-Hot method increased exponentially, leading to its exclusion from our results for k > 7. When pre-training exclusively on the training set, our method, thanks to the GCN encoder, can generalize beyond k-mers present in the training set. In contrast, Node2Vec and Word2Vec can only handle k-mer sizes up to the diversity of the training dataset. Therefore, for k > 6, where the test set introduces new k-mers, we excluded these methods. 5.1 Edit Distance Approximation Table 1 presents the results obtained by using our pre-trained embeddings to estimate edit distances between sequences on the RT988 and Qiita datasets. For the RT988 dataset, our Contrastive Learning (CL) and Node2Vec techniques surpassed Word2Vec and One-Hot. The increased losses in Qiita highlight its greater complexity. In this context, our method’s integration of k-mer structural similarity becomes even more beneficial, outperforming all other tested methods. This benefit becomes more evident as k increases, underscoring our embedding’s capability to adapt to new nodes. 5.2 Closest String Retrieval Tables 2a and 2b present the performance of our zero-shot sequence embeddings, directly derived from the aggregation of our k-mer embeddings, in retrieving the nearest sequences in the Qiita dataset. The tables also showcase a comparison with the embeddings that were specifically fine-tuned for the Edit Distance Task. 4 For direct k-mer aggregation, our Contrastive Learning (CL) embeddings are obtained through concatenation, while for k-mer aggregation with One-Hot, Word2Vec, and Node2Vec, we report the results of the better performing method, either concatenation or averaging. The superior zero-shot non-parametric retrieval performance of our CL method emphasizes the combined utility of both context and structural similarity during self-supervised pre-training. Notably, while k-mers of size around three are optimal for Top 1 percent retrieval, larger k-mers excel in the Top 10 percent metrics. This suggests that smaller k-mers are better at discerning local sequence distances, while larger ones capture broader sequence distances. For embeddings fine-tuned using CNNs for Edit Distance Approximation, the complexity of CNNs obscures differences between the embeddings. Our method based solely on zero-shot concatenated k- mer embeddings outperforms this complex fine-tuning. This shows the advantage of our embeddings over the method by previous work. 6 Conclusion In our study, we introduced a novel k-mer embedding technique that seamlessly integrates metage- nomic contextual and structural nuances, achieved through the enhancement of the De Bruijn graph and the use of contrastive learning. In the Edit Distance Approximation task, our technique con- sistently demonstrated superior performance compared to One-Hot, Word2Vec, and Node2Vec. Moreover, without requiring any downstream fine-tuning, our aggregated k-mer embeddings outper- formed the prior method in the Closest String Retrieval task.

P113.pdf,"Multi-Agent Systems Control Using Graph Neural Networks with Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Abstract Multi-agent systems (MAS) play a crucial role in the advancement of machine intelligence and its applications. To explore complex interactions within MAS settings, we introduce a novel ""GNN for MBRL"" model. This model employs a state-space Graph Neural Network alongside Model-based Reinforcement Learning to tackle MAS tasks, such as Billiard-Avoidance and Autonomous Driving. The process involves using a GNN model to predict the future states and paths of several agents. Subsequently, a Model Predictive Control, enhanced by the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM), is used to guide the ego-agent’s action planning, facilitating successful completion of MAS tasks. 1 Introduction 1.1 Purpose Vision-based approaches have been extensively researched in various reinforcement learning (RL) areas, including mastering video games directly from raw pixels, managing simulated autonomous vehicles using complex image observations, and carrying out robotic tasks like grasping using state representations derived from complicated visual data. However, it has been shown that RL from complex observations such as raw pixels is time-consuming and needs a lot of samples. Additionally, it is widely acknowledged that learning policies from physical state-based characteristics is significantly more effective and straightforward than learning from visual pixels. Therefore, this research focused on learning control policies from states and exploring the use of a graph neural network (GNN) dynamics model to predict future states in multi-agent systems. We then utilized a Cross-Entropy Method (CEM)-optimized model-based controller for motion planning of the ego-agent, which enabled successful execution of specific MAS missions. These include multi-billiard avoidance and self-driving car scenarios. 1.2 Background Inspired by a state-space model for videos that reasons about multiple objects and their positions, velocities, and interactions, our project seeks to develop a ""GNN for MBRL"" model. This model is based on a multi-billiard simulator for sample-efficient model-based control in MAS tasks involving many interacting agents. Autonomous driving, a complicated multi-agent system, requires the ego-agent to consider the situations of surrounding agents when conducting motion planning. The gym-carla can be used for further study in this context. We begin by developing and testing our ""GNN for MBRL"" model on a MAS billiard avoidance scenario to investigate the possibilities of GNNs and model-based RL. We aim to transfer the framework to real-world self-driving applications. Graph Neural Networks. GNNs have been proposed to create node and edge representations in graph data, achieving remarkable success in applications such as recommendation systems, social network prediction, and natural language processing. Recognizing the capabilities of GNNs in physical systems, we can utilize GNN-based reasoning to represent objects as nodes and relations as edges, which allows for an effective approach to analyzing objects and relations. A successful . example of a GNN is the state-space model, STOVE, which combines a GNN dynamics model for inference with an image reconstruction model to accelerate training and improve the unsupervised learning of physical interactions. Thus, the state-space predictive model is the result of combining these two components: zp(xt|zt−1) = zp(z0)zp(z1|z0) Q t zp(zt|zt−1) where x is the image observation and z represents object states. The latent positions and velocities of multiple agents act as the connection between the two components. The model uses simple uniform and Gaussian distributions to initialize the states. The STOVE model is trained on video sequences by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO). STOVE has also extended their video model into reinforcement learning (RL) tasks for planning. Empirical evidence demonstrates that an actor using Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) on top of STOVE is comparable to model-free techniques, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), while needing a fraction of the samples. Inspired by these RL experiments, we apply the GNN model directly to states rather than complex visual data to improve sample efficiency and predict agents’ future states. This is then combined with another model-based RL approach, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC). In the experiment, we train the GNN dynamics model using ground truth states of video sequence data for multi-agent systems instead of visual data. Model-based Reinforcement Learning. Model-based RL is considered a solution to the high sample complexity of model-free RL. This method typically includes two primary steps: (1) creating a dynamics model that predicts future states based on present states and actions, and (2) using a planning method to learn a global policy and act in the environment effectively. The STOVE model uses Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) to develop a policy based on the world model, which acts as a planning simulator, and found that MCTS combined with STOVE could outperform the model-free PPO algorithm in a multi-billiards avoidance task. 2 Method 2.1 Framework The ""GNN for MBRL"" method consists of two primary stages: (1) a GNN dynamics model training phase, using offline recorded video sequences or low-dimensional states for video prediction, and (2) a motion planning phase using CEM-based Model Predictive Control (MPC). This involves a feedback control algorithm with a Cross-Entropy Method optimizer to interact with the billiard environment. The aim is to plan effective actions for the ego-agent in order to avoid collisions. There are two different cases in the GNN dynamics training stage. The ""Action-conditioned case"" follows the STOVE model-based control approach, training GNN with an object reconstruction model on visual data. The ""Supervised RL case"" is designed for RL tasks directly on low-level states. Both cases involve training GNN dynamics models for predicting future multi-agent states. Subsequently, the trained model is integrated into the model-based RL section to control the ego agent for motion planning. After training, MPC uses a model to predict future outputs of a process. It handles multi-input multi- output (MIMO) systems with constraints and incorporates future reference information to improve performance. Therefore, we established a continuous version of the multi-billiard environment for data collection. It is possible to combine the previously trained GNN model with MPC to assess if this method can successfully address MAS tasks. 2.2 Data Generation STOVE proposed an object-aware physics prediction model based on billiard simulations, including avoidance, billiards, gravity, and multi-billiards modes. We wrapped them into a gym environment style, ""gym-billiard,"" which can be easily used by Python API, aiding researchers in understanding this system and creating efficient algorithms. Our project focuses on the avoidance billiard scenario, where the red ball is the ego-object and the RL agent controls it to avoid collisions. In STOVE, the ego-ball has nine actions: movement in eight directions and staying at rest. A negative reward is given when the red ball hits another. We obtained the avoidance sequences datasets using the ""generate_billiards_w_actions"" function. 1000 sequences 2 of length 100 for training and 300 sequences of length 100 for testing were generated using a random action selection policy. The pixel resolution was 32*32 with the ball mass set to 2.0. We changed the environment to use continuous actions for agents, where the red ball is controlled by 2-dimensional numpy values ranging in (-2, 2), representing the acceleration in x and y directions. Similar to the discrete setting, continuous datasets were produced with random actions from a uniform distribution within (-2, 2). These datasets included the image observations, actions, states, dones, and rewards. The average rewards for the continuous mode are lower, indicating more frequent interactions between the balls. Table 1: Basic comparisons of the continuous and discrete datasets. Data Mode Action space Actions dtype Average Rewards of training data Average Rewards of testing data Discrete 9 One-hot mode -17.276 -16.383 Continuous 2 Numpy array -18.93 -18.71 2.3 GNN Dynamics Model Training We used supervised learning to train on ground-truth states rather than high-dimensional image data. The aim is to improve sample efficiency, then combine the trained model with CEM-optimized MPC for predicting future states. Two cases were trained on both Discrete and Continuous datasets: (1) the Action-conditioned case, which makes predictions based on state and action and predicts reward, and (2) the Supervised RL case, where real states including positions and velocities were used as the input for GNN dynamics model. The model can learn to predict future states of multiple agents instead of first extracting the states from visual data with a separate model. Training was performed for 500 epochs, and the model parameters were saved. Training time for the Supervised condition was less than the Action-conditioned case. The GNN model could work on both action space 2 and 9 discrete actions without changing the GNN network architecture, resulting in a unified training framework. 2.4 GNN with MBRL Following traditional Model-based RL, the trained GNN model was combined with CEM-optimized MPC to assess performance on the continuous gym-billiard avoidance task. The saved GNN model predicts future states, and the MPC searches for optimal actions for the ego-agent. The search is repeated after each step to account for prediction errors and rewards, incorporating feedback from the environment. We also conducted experiments on discrete datasets using MCTS and saved videos. For the continuous case, the GNN dynamics model was combined with CEM optimized MPC and compared with random and ground truth scenarios. 3 Results 3.1 GNN Training Results The datasets generated from the gym-billiard API environment, including image observations, actions, states, dones, and rewards, were stored in pickle files. GNN dynamics models were trained in two conditions: (1) Action-conditioned case, which used video sequences with a visual reconstruction model, and (2) Supervised RL case, which used real states as input for the GNN dynamics model. Both conditions were trained for 500 epochs. The Supervised condition took less time to train than the Action-conditioned case. A notable finding is that the GNN model worked equally well for both action space 2 and 9 discrete actions without changing the original GNN architecture. This allows for unified training for both the Discrete and Continuous billiard avoidance environments. After training, model parameters were saved in the ""checkpoints"" folder. ""gifs"" folder stores the videos, and ""states"" contains state and reward files. In the Action-conditioned case, the reward MSE loss decreases for both continuous and discrete conditions. However, the continuous reward error decreased from 0.48 to 0, while the discrete one dropped from 0.16 to 0. The ELBO increased significantly from 450 to 3600. Position and velocity prediction errors decreased during training. The continuous position error was close to the discrete, 3 but the velocity error showed a greater difference. The continuous V_error dropped from 0.65 to 0.05, while the discrete one decreased from 0.07 to 0.01. The four metrics met the criteria for a reasonable GNN dynamics model for the subsequent RL task. In the Supervised RL case, the model directly inputs the ground truth states and actions for GNN training to predict future states. Reconstruction errors were always zero since no image reconstruction was used on the true states. The discrete case showed a better performance compared to the continuous case with respect to the ""Prediction_error"". The continuous loss remained stable for “Total_error”, while the discrete loss showed a downtrend before stabilizing. Generated rollout videos indicated that the ego-red ball performed reasonably well in avoiding collisions. Thus, the trained Supervised RL model can be used for the following model-based RL phase. 3.2 GNN with MBRL In the ""Model-based Control"" framework, we used MCTS on discrete datasets to generate qualitative videos. We changed the mass of the ball agents to 1.0 and 2.0 and trained two GNN dynamics models. During MCTS, the GNN model predicted future sequences for 100 parallel environments with the length of 100, using a maximal rollout depth of 10. We then calculated the mean collision rate and saved 100 videos to show the ego-ball’s interaction with other agents, which demonstrates improved collision avoidance and lower collision rates. For the continuous datasets, we combined the trained GNN model into the CEM optimized MPC method and compared it with random and ground truth cases. The GNN model made accurate predictions based on the current states by checking the code, changing the cuda device and data type. We computed the ""reward,"" the average collisions per epoch, for each method. Table 2: Reward (Collision Rate) for two envs with different baselines. Envs Epochs Horizons GNN_MPC Random Ground_truth m=1 100 50 0.0558+0.0012 0.2790+0.025 0.0707+0.066 m=1 50 100 0.0565+0.0008 0.3543+0.0445 0.0408+0.0392 m=2 100 50 0.0648+0.001 0.2420+0.0178 0.0505+0.0480 m=2 50 100 0.0455+0.0008 0.2690+0.0350 0.0612+0.0575 The ""random"" case used randomly generated actions, while ""ground_truth"" used the true interaction environment for generating next states. The ""m=1"" version task differed slightly from ""m=2"" as the ""m=1"" model was trained on the old continuous datasets, making the red ball movement less flexible. The collision rates in ""GNN_MPC"" were lower than ""Random"" and close to ""ground_truth"". The performance of our proposed method was better than random cases, and the results of ""GNN_MPC"" were close to the ""Ground_truth"" case, which indicated that the trained GNN dynamics model predicts the future states of multi-object systems as well as the ground truth interactive environment. 4 Conclusions We introduced the ""GNN for MBRL"" concept, combining a graph neural network (GNN) dynamics model with CEM-optimized Model Predictive Control (MPC) on a gym-billiard avoidance MAS task. We also conducted experiments on the ""Action-conditioned"" case with MCTS using discrete datasets and explored the ""Supervised RL"" GNN dynamics model with CEM-optimized MPC on continuous datasets. The proposed model predicted video sequences well and controlled the ego-agent to address RL tasks, which may be applied to complex multi-agent systems like the gym-carla autonomous driving environment. 4",0,,,,
P114.pdf,"An Empathetic AI Painter: A System for Computational Creativity Through Embodied Conversational Interaction Abstract This paper presents an investigation into the computational modeling of the creative process of a portrait artist, focusing on the incorporation of human traits like per- sonality and emotions into the artistic process. The system includes an empathetic conversational component to discern the dominant personality traits of the user, and this information is then utilized by a generative AI portraiture module to create a personalized stylization of the user’s portrait. The paper details the system and the outcomes of real-time interactions from a demonstration session. 1 Introduction The incorporation of human traits in the creation of artworks has consistently held significant importance. Although there are differences between art and science regarding their goals and toolsets, these distinctions blur when artists use scientific understanding to inform their work and science examines art to comprehend the human experience. The idea of leveraging established psychological insights into human traits such as personality and emotion to guide the creation, critique, and informing of artwork is not novel. Traditional portrait artists employ their understanding of human perception and vision to create portraits from life or photographs. This process includes the arrangement of the environment, placement of the subject, and an interview to grasp their mental and physical characteristics. Artists also aim to convey their individual painting style while trying to express personal and universal ideas. An artist has several options in themes, brush style, color plan, edge and line plan, abstraction style, and emotional narrative to achieve the finished artwork. Computational creativity and generative art offer fresh avenues for modeling scientific knowledge to replicate this process and deepen our grasp of human creativity. This study uses AI techniques to begin emulating this artistic procedure. The Empathic AI Painter system seeks to discover novel approaches to balance diverse aesthetic and conceptual aspects. 2 System Description The Empathic Painter System is created to mimic the interaction between a live portrait artist and a person, referred to as the sitter. It aims to understand the sitter’s traits, such as personality and emotions, to create a unique portrait by selecting the appropriate abstraction techniques, color palette, and style that correspond to those traits. The system operates in a two-stage process; the first stage involves capturing the characteristics of the sitter, followed by the second stage, which uses the captured traits to generate a stylized artistic representation of their portrait. The initial stage of capturing the personality of the sitter occurs during the conversation with an embodied conversational agent, using empathetic interaction methods. This system utilizes the M-Path conversational agent, which has been developed previously. The M-Path system was modified for this demonstration to conduct an interview based on the Big-5 personality questionnaire to categorize the sitter into one of the established personality dimensions. This data is then used to map the personality traits to a particular artistic style. The mapping is transferred to the Generative AI Portrait Stylization system in . the second stage, which creates an artistic portrait. The interaction process includes several steps. First, a portrait of the sitter is captured under controlled lighting conditions, and a unique ID is assigned after consent is provided for participation and use of the portrait. The sitter is then given information about the M-Path system with instructions about how to interact. The sitter initiates the interaction until a complete conversation is concluded and the agent informs the sitter that the interaction has ended. The M-Path system uses the data collected to classify the sitter’s personality into a specific dimension. This dimension is then used by the Generative AI Portraiture system to create a personalized portrait style. The generated portraits are showcased on a monitor for all participants and the crowd to observe and assess. 2.1 Big-5 Personality Mapping The five-factor model of personality is also known as the ""Big-5 Personality Model"" and is designed as a categorization to capture the variations in personality traits among individuals. This model classifies personality variations across five dimensions: extraversion, openness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and agreeableness. Each of these dimensions encompasses a wide range of psychological functions, which are composed of more specific traits. Extraversion pertains to the extent to which people are dominant, talkative, assertive, active, energetic and enthusiastic. Openness characterizes people who are curious, creative, innovative, imaginative, reflective, cultured, curious, original, broad-minded, intelligent, and artistically sensitive, seeking new experiences and exploring novel ideas. Conscientiousness indicates an individual’s level of hard work, persistence, organization, and motivation in achieving their goals. Individuals high in conscientiousness tend to be organized, plan-oriented, and determined. Neuroticism, also referred to as Emotional Stability, represents differences in emotional stability and adjustment. Individuals scoring high on neuroticism tend to experience negative emotions, such as anxiety, depression, impulsiveness, self-consciousness, vulnerability, anger, hostility and worry. Agreeableness is linked to likability, conformity, friendliness, and social compliance. Individuals with high scores in agreeableness are characterized as trusting, caring, forgiving, altruistic, flexible, gullible, good-natured, soft-hearted, cooperative and tolerant. This model is based on factor analysis of descriptive words of human behavior. The questionnaire used is a shortened version of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory, which has 120 questions and takes 45 minutes to complete. For the online demonstration, one statement for each dimension was used, where the whole conversational interaction could be completed in under 5 minutes. Each question is further modified to align with the conversation setup in the demonstration environment. Dimension Question Openness How do you like the conference so far, is it interesting to you? Conscientiousness Don’t you think the conferences are always a bit chaotic? Extraversion Do you normally talk and interact with a lot of people? Agreeableness How about agents? Do you trust me in sharing how you feel? Neuroticism How do you feel about your portrait being displayed on the screen? Table 1: The questions used for the personality dimensions. The answers to these questions are evaluated for their polarity and then mapped onto two-factor dimensions for personality adjectives. The mapping model is the Abridged Big Five Circumplex Model, in which facets of the Big Five dimensions are mapped as combinations of two factors. The AB5C mapping contains descriptive personality terms for each of the resulting 90 combinations, where the most distinctive trait of an individual is used to select the column, and the second most distinctive trait selects the row. These traits may be either negative or positive. The mapping from Big-5 traits to the Generative AI portrait styles was provided by art experts who independently mapped the styles to the Big-5 categories and reached an agreement. 2.2 Empathic Conversational Avatar The starting point of interaction is the empathetic conversational agent, M-Path, which was developed using a framework based on a computational model of empathy. M-Path is a human-like avatar capable of initiating and maintaining an emotional conversation, based on the predetermined goal of the dialogue. The interaction involves a face-to-face conversation with a human interaction partner, 2 similar to a video-conference with audio and visual input and output. The agent processes the real-time inputs in terms of their linguistic and affective properties to generate empathetic verbal and non-verbal behavior. The main objective of the interaction is to complete the modified Big-5 questionnaire to categorize the partner’s personality and send it to the generative art system. The system has three distinct modules: a perceptual module, a behavior controller and a behavior manager. The perceptual module gathers the video and audio signals when the conversation partner is speaking. This process was triggered with a push-to-talk system. M-Path enters a listening state when the user speaks. During the listening state, speech and facial expressions are processed in real-time for speech and emotion recognition. The video input is used in the facial emotion recognition module, which uses an OpenCV face-recognition algorithm to identify the face. Emotions are categorized using a CNN model, trained on the CK+ Dataset, into 6 basic emotion categories. The speech input is sent to the speech-to-text module which uses a service to get streaming speech recognition. Sentiment analysis evaluates the text for its polarity using the SO-CAL Sentiment Analyzer, which was trained on the NRC-Canada lexicon. The text is sent to the decision-making module for creating conversational responses. This process continues until the partner finishes speaking, which concludes the listening state. The information is then sent to the decision-making module, and the agent enters a thinking state. The behavior controller module creates goal-directed verbal and non-verbal responses in all states of the conversation: listening, thinking, and speaking. This is done by analyzing the user’s emotional response from the listening state. The conversation begins with the user’s greeting and finishes when the agent receives suitable answers to the personality survey questions. The listening, thinking, and speaking states of the agent loop until the user is categorized. During the listening stage, the agent shows a non-verbal affect matching response and backchanneling behavior. Affect matching is a facial expression that mirrors the user’s facial expressions in real-time, chosen by empathy mechanisms. Backchanneling is created by a nodding behavior when pauses are detected in the user’s speech. These behaviors are combined to create an empathic listening behavior. After the conversation with the participant ends, the final text received and the user’s overall sentiment are sent to the Dialogue Manager (DM), and ultimately to the Empathy Mechanisms (EM). The DM completes the Big-5 personality questionnaire to assign a personality category. The EM ensures that the DM generates empathetic responses while reaching its goal. The DM gathers the appropriate emotional response from the EM to generate an emotionally appropriate verbal reaction to the user, followed by a survey-related coping response, and then the next survey question. The system uses the scikit-learn library in Python for the TF-IDF vectorizer model, and the NLTK Lemmatizer. A second model is created by fine-tuning BERT for the classification of user responses according to sentiment and the Big-5 questionnaire answers. The Big-5 questionnaire answers are collected to select the most dominant personality dimensions of the user, based on their probability values and polarity. The Big-5 mapping is used to select a category for the user, with adjectives. This categorization is then sent to the generative art cycle to produce a personalized portrait. After each response is generated by the dialogue manager, it is sent to the behavior manager to be performed by the conversational agent during the speaking state. To achieve a natural conversation, the system continuously produces non-verbal and verbal behaviors. Lip movements, facial expressions, head gestures, body gestures, and posture are synchronized with the agent’s speech. The animation is sent as a BML message to the Smartbody character animation platform, to display the generated behaviors. 2.3 Generative AI Portraiture System The stylistic rendering of the portraits is generated by the generative art component of the system. The portrait goes through three processing phases. The first phase preprocesses the original portrait by using an AI tool to separate the foreground from the background, which will be used to stylize the portrait. Then, the light and color balance of the face are adjusted to achieve a lighting effect, where one side of the face is dramatically shown. The next phase uses this image and the personality category as inputs to a modified Deep Dream (mDD) system with multiple passes on the image to create the base style. While most DD systems use pre-trained networks with object recognition data, the modified system uses artistic paintings and drawings as training data. The system has a dataset of 160,000 labeled and categorized paintings from 3000 artists. A method called hierarchical tight style and tile was developed to overcome the problem that most artists create fewer than 200 paintings in their lifetimes. In the last phase, the source image from the previous phase is further enhanced using the personality category. The ePainterly system combines Deep Style techniques as a surface texture manipulator, and a series of Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR) techniques like particle systems, color palette manipulation, and stroke engine techniques. This iterative process enhances 3 the portrait, and the final result is shown in an online gallery. The ePainterly module is an expansion of the Painterly painting system, which models the cognitive processes of artists based on years of research. The NPR subclass of stroke-based rendering is used as the final part of the process to realize the internal mDD models with stroke-based output. This additional step reduces noise artifacts from the mDD output, creates cohesive stroke-based clustering, and a better distributed color space. 3 Conclusion The Empathic AI Painter was presented at a conference demonstration session. Forty-two participants tested the system, with 26 of them completing the portrait-taking and interaction. Each conversation with the M-Path system took approximately 5 minutes. The performance of the M-Path system was evaluated individually. On average, 84.72 4",1,,,,
P115.pdf,"An Examination of Expansive Multimodal Models: Insights from an Educational Overview Abstract This document provides a summary of a presentation centered on extensive multi- modal models, specifically their development to a level comparable to and poten- tially exceeding that of multimodal GPT-4. The exploration is divided into three sections. Initially, the context is established by discussing recent large-scale models akin to GPT, which are designed for vision and language processing. This sets the stage for exploring research in large multimodal models (LMMs) that are fine-tuned with instructions. Subsequently, the foundational aspects of instruction tuning in large language models are covered, which is a method that is further adapted to the multimodal domain. The final section demonstrates the creation of a basic version of multimodal models similar to GPT-4 using publicly available resources. Additionally, a review of newly developing areas in this field is presented. 1 Introduction With the widespread integration of advanced language models into modern society, there’s a burgeon- ing enthusiasm among scholars and scientists to create open-source large language models (LLMs) and to investigate their growth into large multimodal models (LMMs). This manuscript concentrates on leveraging LLMs for multimodal applications and training LMMs in a comprehensive manner, enabling them to process visual data and engage in conversation. 2 Background 2.1 Image-to-Text Generative Models In their present configuration, LMMs predominantly function as image-to-text generators, accepting images as input and producing textual content as output. The architectural design of these models generally includes an image encoder for deriving visual characteristics and a language model for generating textual sequences. These visual and linguistic components can be interconnected through an adaptable module. Both the image encoder and the language model have the flexibility to be developed from the ground up or based on previously trained models. The training methodology typically involves employing an auto-regressive loss on the generated text tokens. Within the Transformer framework, image tokens have the capability to interact with one another, and each text token is influenced by the preceding text tokens and all image tokens. 2.2 Case Studies We will analyze several established LMMs to demonstrate how the architecture can be actualized across various models while adhering to the same auto-regressive training principle. **Case Study I: LMM Trained with Image-Text Pairs** Many LMMs are developed using extensive collections of image-text pairs. Notable models like Gen- erative Image-to-Text Transformer (GIT) and Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training (BLIP2) . have set high standards across various datasets. GIT utilizes an image encoder from a contrastive pre-trained model and builds a language model independently. Conversely, BLIP2 maintains the pre-trained image and language models in a fixed state while incorporating a trainable Querying Transformer (Q-former), demonstrating efficiency through a unique bootstrapping technique. **Case Study II: LMM Trained with Interleaved Image-Text Sequences** Flamingo serves as an exemplary model in this category, incorporating pre-trained image and language models with the addition of new integrative components. It includes a Perceiver Sampler to streamline computational demands and a Gated Transformer to enhance stability during the early training phase. Flamingo is trained on a diverse mix of large-scale multimodal data sourced exclusively from the web, bypassing the need for conventionally annotated machine learning datasets. Post-training, Flamingo can adapt to vision-based tasks through few-shot learning without additional task-specific tuning. A standout feature of Flamingo is its capability for multimodal in-context learning. When presented with image-text pairs as a demonstration, Flamingo can generalize to new, unseen tasks, such as visual math problems, without further training. It successfully interprets the patterns in task instructions from examples and applies this understanding to new images. Flamingo represents a significant advancement in multimodal learning, akin to the breakthroughs seen with GPT-3 in language processing. 2.3 OpenAI Multimodal GPT-4 and Research Gaps Released in March 2023, OpenAI’s GPT-4 showcases advanced capabilities in understanding and reasoning with visual data. Although specifics of the model remain undisclosed, its ability to facilitate new applications is evident from highlighted examples in technical reports. For instance, it can discern unusual elements within images and demonstrate sophisticated reasoning across text and images. The inquiry into constructing models akin to Multimodal GPT-4 leads us to examine OpenAI’s advanced models, as depicted in Figure 7. Key observations are: (i) GPT-2 serves as the auto- regressive equivalent in the era dominated by BERT’s pre-training then fine-tuning paradigm. (ii) GPT-3, a 175-billion parameter model trained on extensive web text, showcases emergent properties such as in-context learning and chain-of-thoughts (CoT) reasoning without requiring further training. This model represents a shift from fine-tuning model weights to utilizing prompts for broader generalization and reduced adaptation costs. (iii) ChatGPT and InstructGPT emphasize the importance of models following instructions and aligning with human intentions by fine-tuning on high-quality instruction data and using a reinforcement learning framework. (iv) GPT-4 not only enhances previous models’ language capabilities but also incorporates visual inputs for comprehension and reasoning. 3 Pre-requisite: Instruction Tuning in Large Language Models Instruction-following is a concept that originated in the field of natural language processing (NLP). To understand this concept more deeply and trace its development, we revisit the practice of instruction tuning in conjunction with LLMs. 3.1 Instruction Tuning **Traditional Language Data** In the realm of natural language processing, the seq2seq format is frequently employed, where each data point comprises an input sequence and a corresponding output sequence. Typically, task instructions are implicitly understood rather than explicitly stated. Models trained on this data format often struggle to adapt to new tasks in a zero-shot manner because they lack the ability to interpret and generalize task instructions during testing. **Instruct Language Data** Recent advancements involve the explicit incorporation of task instructions during model training. These instructions, often articulated in natural language, lead to a structured format of instruction- input-output triplets. This enables the training of a single model capable of handling multiple tasks 2 with clear directives. The exposure to varied task instructions and examples during training allows the model to generalize to novel tasks through task composition during inference. 3.2 Self-Instruct and Open-Source LLMs The collection of a wide array of high-quality instruction-following data can be achieved through two primary methods: human-human interaction and human-machine interaction. The former is resource-intensive, involving human task providers and annotators, while the latter involves machines or models performing the annotation tasks under human guidance. Self-Instruct tuning represents a streamlined and potent method for aligning LLMs with human intent, utilizing instruction-following data produced by leading teacher LLMs. This technique, which leverages the in-context learning capability of LLMs, has significantly enhanced the zero- and few-shot generalization abilities of LLMs. The iterative process, as illustrated in Figure 9, involves humans providing initial examples, which the LLM then uses to generate further instructions and responses, refining the dataset iteratively. 4 Instructed Tuned Large Multimodal Models This section describes the development of a minimal multimodal GPT-4 model using open-source tools, with a focus on the LLaVA model, and a similar approach in the MiniGPT-4 project. 4.1 Open-Source Prototypes: LLaVA / MiniGPT4 Inspired by successful concepts in NLP, we apply the self-instruct methodology from language processing to the vision-and-language domain. A significant challenge is the absence of a robust multimodal teacher model. Thus, we explore how language-only models like GPT-4 can generate multimodal instruction-following data. 4.1.1 Data Creation Instead of directly inputting images into OpenAI GPT, symbolic sequence representations are used, as shown in Figure 12 (a). LLaVA utilizes captions and bounding boxes for several reasons: (1) GPT-4 is found to comprehend these representations effectively, unlike ChatGPT, which struggles with bounding box data; (2) these elements are crucial for an informative representation of the image. As demonstrated in Figure 12 (b), three forms of instruction-following data are used: multi-turn conversations for interactive user engagement, detailed descriptions for comprehensive response generation, and complex reasoning to address the implications beyond the image content. 4.1.2 Network Architecture and Training As shown in Figure 13, LLaVA’s architecture is a specific implementation of the general image-to-text generative model framework discussed in Section 2 and Figure 3. LLaVA integrates a pre-trained CLIP ViT-L/14 visual encoder with the Vicuna large language model via a projection matrix. The training process involves two stages: - **Stage 1: Pre-training for Feature Alignment.** Only the projection matrix is updated using a portion of the CC3M dataset, focusing solely on image captioning. - **Stage 2: End-to-End Fine-tuning.** Both the projection matrix and the LLM are fine-tuned to cater to various application scenarios. 4.1.3 Performance **Performance on Visual Chat** When fine-tuned on diverse multimodal instruction-following data, LLaVA demonstrates effectiveness in user-oriented applications. Empirical evidence suggests that adjusting only the linear projection layer is adequate for conversational scenarios, although it necessitates longer training periods. In an evaluation using 30 unseen images, each paired with three types of instructions, LLaVA achieved an 85.1 3 **Performance on Science QA** LLaVA, when fine-tuned on a scientific multimodal reasoning dataset, achieved a 90.92 **Performance on OCR in the Wild** Despite not being explicitly trained on OCR data, LLaVA exhibits a surprising zero-shot OCR capability, as illustrated in Figure 16.

The open-source community has rapidly produced a range of models and prototypes that introduce a variety of new functionalities. For instance, LLaVA and Mini-GPT4 are leading the way in the creation of multimodal chatbots, replicating some of the functions described in OpenAI’s GPT-4 technical documentation. Additionally, GILL has broadened the capabilities of LMMs to include comprehensive image generation, a feature not currently present in GPT-4. From the standpoint of introducing basic versions of new multimodal features, the open-source community is seemingly on par with OpenAI’s Multimodal GPT-4, taking initial steps toward developing a versatile multimodal assistant. Nevertheless, there remains a significant disparity when it comes to enhancing a particular func- tionality, such as the visual reasoning seen in LLaVA. The technical documentation from OpenAI provides examples of complex visual tasks that necessitate models capable of processing numerous high-resolution images and extended sequences, in addition to delivering responses that require spe- cialized knowledge. This demands significantly greater computational power and more sophisticated language models, which are generally not accessible to most individuals. 6 Conclusion This paper has outlined the foundational aspects and advanced functionalities of large multimodal models (LMMs). It has revisited the concept of instruction tuning in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrated the steps to construct a basic model akin to LLaVA and MiniGPT4 with open-source tools. Furthermore, it has categorized and summarized the most recent advancements in this research area, offering a starting point for those keen to embark on LMM exploration. The paper also proposes future directions for community-driven efforts. It suggests that entities with substantial resources should concentrate on scaling existing capabilities and exploring new emergent properties. Meanwhile, others can focus on creating prototypes for new features, developing evalua- tion methods, and devising strategies to lower computational demands, thereby making advanced model computation more widely accessible.

P116.pdf,"Improving Random Forests through Random Splitting Abstract To enhance the accuracy and scalability of decision tree algorithms, we introduce a generalization called Top-k. This approach considers the top k features as potential splits at each step, rather than the single best feature, offering a trade-off between the simplicity of greedy algorithms and the accuracy of optimal decision trees. The core idea is to explore a wider range of potential splits at each node, mitigating the risk of early commitment to suboptimal choices inherent in traditional greedy approaches. This exploration is controlled by the parameter k, allowing for a flexible balance between computational cost and predictive performance. Larger values of k lead to more exhaustive searches, potentially improving accuracy but increasing computational complexity. Conversely, smaller values of k prioritize efficiency, sacrificing some accuracy for speed. 1 Introduction Decision trees are a fundamental class of machine learning algorithms renowned for their inter- pretability and ease of implementation. However, traditional greedy algorithms like ID3, C4.5, and CART [1, 2] suffer from limitations in accuracy and scalability, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional datasets. These algorithms typically select the single best feature for splitting at each node, a process that can be susceptible to noise and prone to suboptimal choices early in the tree construction. This inherent greediness can lead to shallow trees with limited predictive power, especially when relevant features are masked by irrelevant ones. The computational cost, while generally manageable for smaller datasets, can also become prohibitive for larger-scale applications. To address these limitations, we introduce Top-k, a novel generalization of decision tree algorithms that offers a compelling balance between accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. Instead of selecting only the single best feature at each node, Top-k considers the top k features as potential split candidates. This approach allows for a more thorough exploration of the feature space, mitigating the risk of early commitment to suboptimal splits. The parameter k provides a flexible control mechanism: larger values of k lead to more exhaustive searches, potentially improving accuracy but increasing computational complexity, while smaller values prioritize efficiency at the cost of some accuracy. This trade-off allows practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs and computational resources. The core innovation of Top-k lies in its ability to escape the limitations of greedy feature selection. By considering multiple top features, Top-k reduces the probability of selecting an irrelevant or noisy feature early in the tree construction. This is particularly beneficial in high-dimensional settings where the presence of numerous irrelevant features can significantly hinder the performance of traditional greedy algorithms. The increased exploration afforded by Top-k leads to deeper and more accurate trees, resulting in improved predictive performance. Our theoretical analysis provides a rigorous foundation for the advantages of Top-k. We derive a lower bound on the generalization error of Top-k, demonstrating that under certain conditions, this bound is tighter than those achievable by traditional greedy algorithms [3]. This theoretical improvement is complemented by our extensive empirical evaluation, which showcases the consistent superiority of Top-k across a range of benchmark datasets. The improvement is particularly pronounced in high-dimensional datasets, where the benefits of exploring multiple features become most evident. . The practical implementation of Top-k is surprisingly efficient. We leverage optimized data structures and algorithms to manage the top k feature candidates, ensuring that the computational overhead remains manageable even for large datasets and high values of k. Our experiments demonstrate that the computational cost scales gracefully with both the dataset size and the value of k, making Top-k a practical alternative to traditional decision tree algorithms in various applications. Beyond its improved accuracy and scalability, Top-k retains the inherent interpretability of decision trees. The tree structure remains easily understandable, and the Top-k modification only adds a layer of controlled exploration, not fundamentally altering the decision-making process. This makes Top-k particularly suitable for applications where both high accuracy and explainability are crucial. Furthermore, we explore the integration of Top-k into ensemble methods like random forests and gradient boosting machines, demonstrating its versatility and potential for further performance enhancements [4]. We also investigate the impact of different feature selection metrics on Top-k’s performance, providing insights into its adaptability to various datasets and problem domains. Finally, we discuss the limitations of Top-k and outline promising avenues for future research. 2 Related Work Decision trees have been a cornerstone of machine learning for decades, with algorithms like ID3 ?, C4.5 ?, and CART ? forming the foundation of many applications. These algorithms, however, rely on greedy approaches that select the single best feature at each node, potentially leading to suboptimal splits and limited accuracy, especially in high-dimensional spaces. The inherent limitations of greedy feature selection have motivated extensive research into alternative strategies. One line of research focuses on improving the feature selection process itself, exploring more sophisticated metrics beyond information gain and Gini impurity ?. Other approaches have investigated ensemble methods, such as random forests ? and gradient boosting machines ?, which combine multiple decision trees to enhance predictive performance. These ensemble techniques often mitigate the limitations of individual trees but can introduce increased computational complexity. Our work builds upon this rich body of research by proposing a novel generalization of decision tree algorithms that directly addresses the limitations of greedy feature selection. Unlike traditional methods that focus solely on the single best feature, Top-k explores the top k features at each node, offering a controlled trade-off between computational cost and accuracy. This approach is distinct from other ensemble methods in that it modifies the base learner itself, rather than relying on combining multiple independently trained trees. The parameter k provides a flexible mechanism to adjust the exploration-exploitation balance, allowing practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs and computational resources. This flexibility is a key advantage over existing methods that often lack such a tunable parameter for controlling the complexity of the search space. Several studies have explored alternative splitting criteria for decision trees, aiming to improve accuracy and robustness. For instance, research has investigated the use of different impurity measures, such as entropy and variance, and their impact on tree performance ?. However, these studies primarily focus on improving the single-feature selection process, without addressing the fundamental limitation of greedy approaches. Top-k, in contrast, directly tackles this limitation by considering multiple features at each split, offering a more robust and accurate approach. This fundamental difference distinguishes Top-k from previous work that primarily focuses on refining the feature selection metric or the tree structure itself. The concept of considering multiple features during splitting has been explored in other contexts, such as oblique decision trees ?, which use linear combinations of features for splitting. However, these methods often introduce increased computational complexity and can be less interpretable than traditional decision trees. Top-k, on the other hand, maintains the inherent interpretability of decision trees while offering a more efficient and scalable approach to multi-feature splitting. The simplicity and efficiency of Top-k are crucial advantages, making it a practical alternative to more complex methods. Furthermore, our work contributes to the broader field of high-dimensional data analysis. In high- dimensional settings, the presence of numerous irrelevant features can significantly hinder the performance of traditional greedy algorithms. Top-k’s ability to explore multiple features helps mitigate this issue, leading to improved accuracy and robustness in such scenarios. This is particularly relevant in modern applications where datasets often contain thousands or even millions of features. 2 The scalability of Top-k makes it a suitable choice for these large-scale problems, where traditional methods may struggle. Finally, our theoretical analysis provides a rigorous foundation for the advantages of Top-k, deriving a lower bound on the generalization error that is tighter than those achievable by traditional greedy algo- rithms. This theoretical contribution complements our empirical findings, providing a comprehensive understanding of Top-k’s performance and its advantages over existing methods. The combination of theoretical analysis and empirical validation strengthens the overall contribution of our work. Future research could explore adaptive strategies for choosing the optimal value of k during training, further enhancing the performance and adaptability of Top-k. 3 Background Decision trees are a fundamental class of machine learning algorithms widely used due to their interpretability and relative simplicity. Traditional algorithms such as ID3 ?, C4.5 ?, and CART ? construct trees by recursively partitioning the data based on a greedy selection of the single best feature at each node. This greedy approach, while computationally efficient, suffers from limitations in accuracy and scalability, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional datasets or datasets with noisy features. The selection of a single best feature at each node can lead to suboptimal splits early in the tree construction process, resulting in shallow trees with limited predictive power. This is especially problematic when relevant features are masked by numerous irrelevant or noisy ones. Furthermore, the computational cost of these algorithms can become prohibitive for large datasets, hindering their applicability in many real-world scenarios. The inherent limitations of greedy feature selection have motivated extensive research into alternative strategies for building more accurate and efficient decision trees. One area of active research focuses on improving the feature selection process itself. Researchers have explored more sophisticated metrics beyond the commonly used information gain and Gini impurity ?, aiming to identify more informative features for splitting. However, even with improved feature selection metrics, the fundamental limitation of selecting only a single feature at each node remains. Another line of research has focused on ensemble methods, such as random forests ? and gradient boosting machines ?, which combine multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance. These ensemble techniques often mitigate the limitations of individual trees but can introduce increased computational complexity and reduce interpretability. The challenge lies in finding a balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. The limitations of traditional decision tree algorithms stem from their inherent greediness. The single- best-feature selection strategy can lead to premature commitment to suboptimal splits, hindering the ability of the algorithm to discover more complex relationships within the data. This is particularly evident in high-dimensional datasets where the presence of many irrelevant features can significantly impact the performance of greedy algorithms. The noise and irrelevant information can easily mislead the algorithm, leading to inaccurate and unreliable predictions. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the greedy approach does not allow for backtracking or revisiting previous decisions, making it susceptible to errors made early in the tree construction process. This inherent limitation motivates the need for more robust and less greedy approaches to decision tree construction. Our proposed Top-k algorithm directly addresses the limitations of greedy feature selection by considering multiple top features at each node. Instead of selecting only the single best feature, Top-k explores the top k features as potential split candidates. This allows for a more thorough exploration of the feature space, mitigating the risk of early commitment to suboptimal splits. The parameter k provides a flexible control mechanism, allowing for a trade-off between computational cost and accuracy. Larger values of k lead to more exhaustive searches, potentially improving accuracy but increasing computational complexity, while smaller values prioritize efficiency at the cost of some accuracy. This flexibility allows practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs and computational resources. The core innovation of Top-k lies in its ability to escape the limitations of greedy feature selection by considering multiple features at each split. This approach reduces the probability of selecting an irrelevant or noisy feature early in the tree construction process, leading to deeper and more accurate trees. The increased exploration afforded by Top-k is particularly beneficial in high-dimensional settings where the presence of numerous irrelevant features can significantly hinder the performance 3 of traditional greedy algorithms. By considering multiple features, Top-k reduces the impact of noise and irrelevant information, resulting in improved robustness and predictive performance. The algorithm’s efficiency is further enhanced by the use of optimized data structures and algorithms for managing the top k feature candidates. The theoretical analysis of Top-k provides a rigorous foundation for its advantages over traditional greedy algorithms. We derive a lower bound on the generalization error of Top-k, demonstrating that under certain conditions, this bound is tighter than those achievable by traditional methods ?. This theoretical improvement is complemented by our extensive empirical evaluation, which showcases the consistent superiority of Top-k across a range of benchmark datasets. The improvement is particularly pronounced in high-dimensional datasets, where the benefits of exploring multiple features become most evident. The combination of theoretical analysis and empirical validation provides a comprehensive understanding of Top-k’s performance and its advantages over existing methods. Furthermore, the inherent interpretability of decision trees is preserved in Top-k, making it a valuable tool for applications where both high accuracy and explainability are crucial. 4 Methodology The Top-k algorithm builds upon the fundamental principles of traditional decision tree algorithms but introduces a key modification to the feature selection process. Instead of greedily selecting the single best feature at each node, Top-k considers the top k features as potential split candidates. This approach significantly alters the search space explored during tree construction, leading to a more robust and less prone-to-error process. The algorithm proceeds recursively, starting with the root node and the entire dataset. At each node, the top k features are identified based on a chosen splitting criterion (e.g., information gain, Gini impurity). For each of these top k features, the optimal split point is determined, and the resulting information gain or impurity reduction is calculated. The feature and split point yielding the maximum improvement are then selected to partition the data into child nodes. This process is repeated recursively for each child node until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum depth, minimum number of samples per leaf). The selection of the top k features is a crucial step in the Top-k algorithm. We employ efficient sorting algorithms to identify the top k features based on the chosen splitting criterion. The computational complexity of this step is primarily determined by the sorting algorithm used and the number of features in the dataset. To maintain efficiency, we leverage optimized data structures and algorithms, ensuring that the computational overhead remains manageable even for large datasets and high values of k. We experimented with various sorting algorithms, including quicksort and mergesort, and found that quicksort generally provided the best performance in our experiments. The choice of sorting algorithm can be further optimized based on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the available computational resources. Furthermore, we explored the use of approximate sorting algorithms to further reduce the computational cost, particularly for very large datasets. The choice of splitting criterion significantly influences the performance of the Top-k algorithm. We investigated the use of several common splitting criteria, including information gain, Gini impurity, and variance reduction. Each criterion offers a different trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. Information gain, for instance, is computationally more expensive than Gini impurity but often leads to more accurate trees. Variance reduction, on the other hand, is particularly suitable for regression tasks. Our experiments compared the performance of Top-k using these different criteria across a range of benchmark datasets. The results indicated that the optimal choice of splitting criterion depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset, highlighting the adaptability of Top-k to various scenarios. We also explored the possibility of using adaptive splitting criteria, which dynamically adjust the criterion based on the characteristics of the data at each node. The parameter k plays a crucial role in controlling the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. Larger values of k lead to a more exhaustive search of the feature space, potentially improv- ing accuracy but increasing computational complexity. Conversely, smaller values of k prioritize efficiency, sacrificing some accuracy for speed. The optimal value of k depends on the specific dataset and the available computational resources. In our experiments, we systematically varied the value of k to investigate its impact on both accuracy and computational cost. We observed that the improvement in accuracy plateaus beyond a certain value of k, suggesting that there is a point of diminishing returns. This observation provides valuable guidance for practitioners in choosing an 4 appropriate value of k for their specific applications. Furthermore, we explored adaptive strategies for choosing the value of k during training, dynamically adjusting it based on the characteristics of the data at each node. The implementation of Top-k is surprisingly straightforward. We developed a Python implementation of the algorithm, leveraging efficient data structures and algorithms from the Scikit-learn library. The code is well-documented and readily available for reproducibility. The implementation includes options for choosing different splitting criteria, setting the value of k, and specifying various stopping criteria. The modular design of the code allows for easy extension and customization. The computa- tional cost of the algorithm scales gracefully with both the dataset size and the value of k, making it a practical alternative to traditional decision tree algorithms in various applications. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the scalability of the algorithm, demonstrating its ability to handle large datasets efficiently. Finally, we evaluated the performance of Top-k on a range of benchmark datasets, comparing its accuracy and computational cost to traditional decision tree algorithms such as ID3, C4.5, and CART ???. The results consistently demonstrated the superiority of Top-k in terms of accuracy, particularly in high-dimensional datasets. The computational cost of Top-k, while higher than traditional greedy algorithms, remained manageable, especially when considering the significant improvement in accuracy. The parameter k provided a flexible mechanism to control this trade-off, allowing practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs and computational resources. The results of our experiments are presented in detail in the Results section. 5 Experiments This section details the experimental setup and results obtained to evaluate the performance of the Top-k algorithm. We compared Top-k against three widely used decision tree algorithms: ID3 ?, C4.5 ?, and CART ?. Our experiments were conducted on a diverse range of benchmark datasets, encompassing both low-dimensional and high-dimensional instances, to thoroughly assess the algorithm’s robustness and scalability. The datasets were pre-processed to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring a fair comparison across all algorithms. We employed standard data splitting techniques, reserving a portion of each dataset for testing and using the remaining data for training. Performance was evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, providing a comprehensive assessment of the algorithm’s predictive capabilities. The choice of these metrics was driven by the need to capture various aspects of the algorithm’s performance, including its ability to correctly classify positive and negative instances. Furthermore, we analyzed the computational cost of each algorithm, measuring the training time and memory usage to assess their scalability. This comprehensive evaluation allowed us to draw meaningful conclusions about the relative strengths and weaknesses of Top-k compared to traditional decision tree algorithms. The parameter k in the Top-k algorithm plays a crucial role in balancing accuracy and computational cost. To investigate this trade-off, we conducted experiments with varying values of k, ranging from 1 (equivalent to traditional greedy algorithms) to a significantly larger value determined by the dimensionality of the dataset. For each value of k, we trained and evaluated the Top-k algorithm on each benchmark dataset, recording both the performance metrics and the computational cost. This systematic variation of k allowed us to observe the impact of increased exploration on both accuracy and efficiency. We observed that increasing k generally led to improved accuracy, particularly in high- dimensional datasets where the greedy selection of a single feature can be highly susceptible to noise and irrelevant information. However, this improvement came at the cost of increased computational time, highlighting the inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The optimal value of k was found to be dataset-dependent, suggesting the need for adaptive strategies for choosing k in practical applications. We also investigated the impact of different feature selection metrics on the performance of Top-k. We compared the use of information gain, Gini impurity, and variance reduction, evaluating their influence on both accuracy and computational efficiency. Our results indicated that the optimal choice of metric depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset. Information gain generally yielded higher accuracy but at a higher computational cost, while Gini impurity provided a good balance between accuracy and efficiency. Variance reduction, suitable for regression tasks, showed promising results in datasets with continuous target variables. These findings highlight the adaptability of Top-k 5 to various scenarios and the importance of selecting an appropriate feature selection metric based on the dataset’s characteristics. Further research could explore more sophisticated feature selection metrics or adaptive strategies that dynamically adjust the metric based on the data at each node. The experiments were conducted on a variety of datasets, including both publicly available benchmark datasets and custom datasets generated to simulate specific scenarios. The publicly available datasets were chosen to represent a range of characteristics, including dimensionality, sample size, and class distribution. The custom datasets were designed to test the algorithm’s performance under controlled conditions, allowing us to isolate the effects of specific factors such as noise and irrelevant features. The results obtained from these experiments provided a comprehensive evaluation of the Top-k algorithm’s performance across a wide range of scenarios. The detailed results, including performance metrics and computational costs for each dataset and algorithm, are presented in the following tables.

Top-k consistently achieves higher accuracy while maintaining a reasonable computational cost. The increase in computational cost is justified by the significant improvement in accuracy, particularly in high-dimensional datasets. The choice of k significantly impacts the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, allowing practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs. Further analysis of the results, including statistical significance tests, is provided in the supplementary material. The findings strongly support the claim that Top-k offers a compelling combination of accuracy, scalability, and interpretability, making it a promising alternative to traditional decision tree algorithms. Future work will focus on exploring adaptive strategies for choosing k and investigating the algorithm’s performance on even larger and more complex datasets. 6 Results This section presents the empirical results obtained from evaluating the Top-k algorithm against traditional decision tree algorithms (ID3, C4.5, and CART) across a range of benchmark datasets. We assessed performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and computational cost (training time and memory usage). The datasets were pre-processed to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring a fair comparison. A stratified k-fold cross-validation approach was employed to mitigate the effects of data variability and obtain robust performance estimates. The specific datasets used included several publicly available datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository, chosen to represent diverse characteristics in terms of dimensionality, sample size, and class distribution. We 6 also included synthetic datasets generated to control specific factors like noise levels and feature relevance, allowing for a more targeted analysis of the algorithm’s behavior under various conditions. The results are presented in tables and figures below, followed by a detailed discussion. Our experiments systematically varied the parameter k in the Top-k algorithm, ranging from 1 (equivalent to traditional greedy algorithms) to values significantly larger than 1, up to a fraction of the total number of features. This allowed us to investigate the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost as the exploration of the feature space increased. As expected, increasing k generally led to improved accuracy, particularly in high-dimensional datasets where the greedy selection of a single feature is more susceptible to noise and irrelevant information. However, this improvement came at the cost of increased computational time, reflecting the increased search space explored by the algorithm. The optimal value of k was found to be dataset-dependent, suggesting the need for adaptive strategies for choosing k in practical applications. This observation highlights the flexibility of Top-k in adapting to different data characteristics and computational constraints. The impact of different feature selection metrics was also investigated. We compared information gain, Gini impurity, and variance reduction, evaluating their influence on accuracy and efficiency. Information gain generally yielded higher accuracy but at a higher computational cost, while Gini impurity provided a good balance between accuracy and efficiency. Variance reduction, suitable for regression tasks, showed promising results in datasets with continuous target variables. These findings underscore the adaptability of Top-k to various scenarios and the importance of selecting an appropriate feature selection metric based on the dataset’s characteristics. Future work could explore more sophisticated feature selection metrics or adaptive strategies that dynamically adjust the metric based on the data at each node.

The results consistently demonstrate the superior accuracy of Top-k, particularly in the high-dimensional synthetic dataset. The increase in computational cost is relatively modest, especially considering the significant accuracy gains. A more comprehensive analysis, including precision, recall, F1-score, and statistical significance tests, is provided in the supplementary material. These results strongly support the claim that Top-k offers a compelling combination of accuracy and efficiency. Further analysis revealed that the improvement in accuracy offered by Top-k is more pronounced in datasets with high dimensionality and noisy features. This is consistent with our hypothesis that considering multiple top features mitigates the risk of early commitment to suboptimal splits caused by the greedy nature of traditional algorithms. The flexibility offered by the parameter k allows practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs, balancing computational cost and predictive performance. The interpretability of Top-k remains largely unchanged from traditional decision trees. The tree structure remains easily understandable, and the Top-k modification only adds a layer of controlled exploration during the feature selection process, not fundamentally altering the decision-making process. This makes Top-k particularly suitable for applications where both high accuracy and explainability are crucial. 7 Future work will focus on exploring adaptive strategies for choosing k, investigating the algorithm’s performance on even larger and more complex datasets, and extending Top-k to other tree-based ensemble methods. The promising results presented here suggest that Top-k represents a significant advancement in decision tree algorithms, offering a compelling alternative to traditional methods. 7 Conclusion In this paper, we introduced Top-k, a novel generalization of decision tree algorithms designed to enhance accuracy and scalability while preserving interpretability. Our approach departs from the traditional greedy methods (ID3, C4.5, CART) ??? by considering the top k features as potential split candidates at each node, rather than just the single best feature. This strategic modification allows for a more thorough exploration of the feature space, mitigating the risk of early commitment to suboptimal splits that often plague greedy algorithms, especially in high-dimensional settings. The parameter k provides a flexible mechanism to control this exploration-exploitation trade-off, enabling practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs and computational resources.

P117.pdf,"Rapid Image Annotation Through Zero-Shot Learning Abstract Recent experiments on word analogies demonstrate that contemporary word vectors effectively encapsulate subtle linguistic patterns through linear vector displace- ments. However, the extent to which these straightforward vector displacements can represent visual patterns across words remains uncertain. This research in- vestigates a particular image-word relevance relationship. The findings indicate that, for a given image, word vectors of pertinent tags are positioned higher than those of unrelated tags along a primary axis within the word vector space. Drawing inspiration from this insight, we suggest addressing image tagging by determining the main axis for an image. Specifically, we utilize linear mappings and intricate deep neural networks to deduce the primary axis from an input image. The re- sultant tagging model exhibits remarkable adaptability. It operates swiftly on test images, with a processing time that remains constant regardless of the training set’s size. Furthermore, it showcases exceptional performance not only in conventional tagging tasks using the NUS-WIDE dataset but also in comparison to competitive baselines when assigning tags to images that haven’t been seen during training. 1 Introduction Recent advancements in representing words in vector spaces have proven advantageous for both Natural Language Processing and various computer vision applications, including zero-shot learning and image caption generation. The rationale behind using word vectors in NLP is rooted in the observation that detailed linguistic patterns among words are represented by linear offsets of word vectors. This pivotal insight emerged from well-known word analogy studies. For example, syntactic relationships like ""dance"" to ""dancing"" parallel ""fly"" to ""flying,"" and semantic connections like ""king"" to ""man"" mirror ""queen"" to ""woman."" Nevertheless, it is yet to be determined whether the visual patterns across words, implicitly employed in the aforementioned computer vision tasks, can similarly be represented by these basic vector offsets. This paper focuses on the task of image tagging, where an image necessitates the division of a word lexicon into two distinct groups based on image-word relevance. For example, an image of a zoo might have relevant tags like ""people,"" ""animal,"" and ""zoo,"" while irrelevant tags might include ""sailor,"" ""book,"" and ""landscape."" This lexical division fundamentally differs from the nuanced syntactic or semantic relationships examined in word analogy tests. Instead, it concerns the connection between two sets of words as prompted by a visual image. This type of word relationship is semantic and descriptive, emphasizing visual association, albeit at a broader level. Given this context, it is worth investigating whether word vectors maintain the property where simple linear vector offsets can depict visual or image-based associative relationships between words. In the zoo example, while it’s easy for humans to recognize that words like ""people,"" ""animal,"" and ""zoo"" are more related to the zoo than words like ""sailor,"" ""book,"" and ""landscape,"" the question is whether such a zoo-association relationship can be represented by the nine pairwise vector offsets: ""people"" minus ""sailor,"" ""people"" minus ""book,"" and so on, up to ""zoo"" minus ""landscape,"" between the vectors of relevant and irrelevant tags. A primary contribution of this research is an empirical investigation of these questions. Each image establishes a visual association rule over words, represented as a pair (Y, Y). Leveraging the extensive . image collections in benchmark datasets designed for image tagging, we can explore numerous distinct visual association rules in words and the corresponding vector offsets in the word vector space. Our findings uncover a significant correlation: the offsets between the vectors of relevant tags (Y) and those of irrelevant tags (Y) predominantly align in a consistent direction, which we term the ""principal direction"". In other words, within the word vector space, there exists at least one vector (direction), denoted as w, such that its inner products with the vector offsets between Y and Y are greater than 0. This can be expressed as: (w,p ˘2014 n) > 0 equivalently, (w,p) > (w,n) This implies that the vector w ranks all relevant words Y ahead of irrelevant ones Y. The visual association patterns among words manifest as the linear rank-abilities of their correspond- ing word vectors. This observation corroborates findings from word analogy studies, suggesting that multiple relationships for a single word are embedded within a high-dimensional space. Furthermore, these relationships can be articulated using basic linear vector arithmetic. Building on this discovery, we propose a solution to the image tagging challenge by identifying the primary axis along which relevant tags are ranked higher than irrelevant ones within the word vector space. We employ both linear mappings and deep neural networks to infer this primary axis from each input image. This unique perspective on image tagging yields a highly adaptable tagging model. The model processes test images rapidly, maintaining a constant processing time irrespective of the training dataset’s size. It not only delivers outstanding results in traditional tagging tasks but also excels at assigning new tags from a broad vocabulary that were not encountered during training. Our method does not rely on prior knowledge of these new tags, as long as they exist within the same vector space as the tags used during training. Consequently, we designate our technique as ""fast zero-shot image tagging"" (Fast0Tag), acknowledging its strengths in both speed and its zero-shot learning capabilities. In stark contrast to our approach, prior methods for image tagging are limited to assigning only those tags to test images that were seen during training, with a notable exception. These methods are constrained by the fixed and often limited number of tags present in the training data, which poses practical challenges. For example, Flickr hosts approximately 53 million tags, and this number is rapidly increasing. The work of Fu et al. represents a pioneering effort to extend an image tagging model to previously unseen tags. However, when compared to our proposed method, it depends on two extra assumptions. Firstly, it assumes that unseen tags are known beforehand to enable model adjustment toward these tags. Secondly, it assumes that test images are known in advance for model regularization. Moreover, this method is restricted to a very limited number, U, of unseen tags, as it needs to account for all 2Upossibletagcombinations. To recap, our primary contribution lies in analyzing visual association patterns in words as they relate to images and how these patterns are reflected in word vector offsets. We posit and confirm through experiments that a main direction exists in the word vector space for each visual association rule (Y, Y), where vectors of relevant words are ranked higher than others. Building on this, our second contribution is an innovative image tagging model, Fast0Tag, which is both swift and capable of handling an open vocabulary of unseen tags. Lastly, we explore three distinct image tagging scenarios: traditional tagging, which assigns seen tags to images; zero-shot tagging, which annotates images with numerous unseen tags; and seen/unseen tagging, which uses both seen and unseen tags. Existing research either addresses traditional tagging or zero-shot tagging with a limited number of unseen tags. Our Fast0Tag method surpasses competitive baselines across all three scenarios. 2 Related Work Image Tagging. The objective of image tagging is to allocate pertinent tags to an image or to generate a ranked list of tags. Within the academic community, this challenge has predominantly been tackled from the standpoint of tag ranking. Generative approaches, which incorporate topic models and mixture models, inherently rank candidate tags based on their conditional probabilities relative to the test image. Conversely, non-parametric, nearest-neighbor-based techniques frequently rank tags for a test image by aggregating votes from a selection of training images. Although nearest-neighbor methods generally exhibit superior performance compared to those reliant on generative models, they are plagued by substantial computational demands during both training and testing phases. 2 The recently introduced FastTag algorithm offers a significant speed advantage while maintaining performance levels on par with nearest-neighbor methods. Our Fast0Tag method mirrors the reduced complexity of FastTag. Embedding techniques, on the other hand, determine tag ranking scores via a cross-modal mapping between images and tags. This concept has been further developed using deep neural networks. Notably, aside from certain exceptions, the majority of these methods do not train their models with an explicit ranking objective, despite ultimately ranking candidate tags for test images. This discrepancy between the trained models and their practical application contravenes the principle of Occam’s razor. We incorporate a ranking loss in our approach, similar to these exceptions. Unlike our Fast0Tag, which is capable of ranking both known and an unlimited number of previously unseen tags for test images, the methods mentioned earlier are restricted to assigning tags to images from a predetermined vocabulary encountered during train- ing. An exception to this is the work by Fu et al., where they address a predefined number, U, of unseen tags by developing a multi-label model that considers all possible 2Ucombinationsofthesetags.However, thisapproachisconstrainedbythesmallnumberUofunseentagsitcanhandle. Word Embedding. Diverging from the conventional one-hot vector representation of words, word embedding maps each word to a continuous-valued vector, primarily learning from the statistical patterns of word co-occurrences. While earlier studies on word embedding exist, our research emphasizes the latest GloVe and word2vec vectors. As demonstrated in the well-known word analogy experiments, both types of word vectors effectively capture detailed semantic and syntactic patterns through vector offsets. In this study, we further reveal that basic linear offsets can also represent the broader visual association patterns among words. Zero-Shot Learning. The term ""zero-shot learning"" is frequently used interchangeably with ""zero-shot classification,"" although the latter is actually a subset of the former. In contrast to weakly-supervised learning, which acquires new concepts by extracting information from noisy samples, zero-shot classification aims to classify objects from unseen classes by learning classifiers from seen classes. Attributes and word vectors are two primary semantic sources that enable zero-shot classification. Our Fast0Tag, together with Fu et al., expands the domain of zero-shot learning to include zero- shot multi-label classification. Fu et al. approach this by converting the problem into zero-shot classification, where each combination of multiple labels is treated as a separate class. We, on the other hand, model the labels directly, allowing us to assign or rank a large number of unseen tags for an image. 3 The Linear Rank-Ability of Word Vectors Our Fast0Tag method is enhanced by the discovery that the visual relationship between words, specifically how a lexicon is divided based on relevance to an image, manifests in the word vector space as a main direction. Along this direction, words or tags that are relevant to the image are ranked higher than those that are not. This section elaborates on this discovery. 3.1 The Regulation Over Words Due to Image Tagging Let’s denote S as the set of seen tags available for training image tagging models, and U as the set of tags unseen during the training phase. The training data is structured as (xm, Ym); m = 1, 2, ..., M, where xm represents the feature vector of image m in RD, and Ym is a subset of S, containing the seen tags relevant to that image. For simplicity, we also use Ym to represent the collection of corresponding word or tag vectors. Traditional image tagging seeks to assign seen tags from S to test images. Zero-shot tagging, as defined by Fu et al., aims to annotate test images using a predetermined set of unseen tags, U. Beyond these two scenarios, this paper introduces seen/unseen image tagging, which identifies both relevant seen tags from S and relevant unseen tags from U for test images. Furthermore, the set of unseen tags, U, can be open and continuously expanding. We define Ym as the complement of Ym in S, representing irrelevant seen tags. An image m establishes a visual association rule among words, essentially partitioning seen tags into two distinct sets: Ym and Ym. Recognizing that various detailed syntactic and semantic patterns among words 3 can be depicted through linear word vector offsets, we proceed to investigate the characteristics these vector offsets might exhibit for this novel visual association rule. 3.2 Principal Direction and Cluster Structure Figure 2 offers a visual representation of vector offsets (p - n), where p belongs to Ym and n belongs to Ym, using both t-SNE and PCA for two different visual association rules over words. One rule is defined by an image associated with 5 relevant tags, and the other by an image with 15 relevant tags. From these vector offsets, we identify two key structures: Principal Direction: For a given visual association rule (Ym, Ym) in words for image m, the vector offsets predominantly point in a similar direction, which we refer to as the principal direction. This suggests that along this principal direction, relevant tags Ym are ranked higher than irrelevant ones Ym. Cluster Structure: Within each visual association rule over words, there are discernible cluster structures in the vector offsets. Moreover, all offsets that point to the same relevant tag in Ym are grouped within the same cluster. In Figure 2, we distinguish offsets pointing to different relevant tags by using different colors. The question remains whether these two observations can be generalized. Specifically, do they remain valid in the high-dimensional word vector space for a broader range of visual association rules defined by other images? To address this, we designed an experiment to confirm the existence of principal directions in word vector spaces, or equivalently, the linear rank-ability of word vectors. We defer the investigation of the cluster structure to future research. 3.3 Testing the Linear Rank-Ability Hypothesis The experiments in this section are performed using the validation set of the NUS-WIDE dataset, which includes 26,844 images, 925 seen tags (S), and 81 unseen tags (U). The number of relevant seen/unseen tags associated with an image varies from 1 to 20/117, with an average of 1.7/4.9. Further details can be found in Section 5. Our goal is to explore whether a primary direction exists for any visual association rule (Ym, Ym) created by image m, along which relevant tags Ym rank higher than irrelevant tags Ym. This can be confirmed if we find a vector w in the word vector space that fulfills the ranking conditions (w, p) > (w, n) for all p in Ym and n in Ym. To achieve this, we train a linear ranking SVM for each visual association rule using all corresponding pairs (p, n). We then rank word vectors using the SVM and assess the number of violated constraints. Specifically, we use MiAP, with higher values being preferable, to compare the SVM’s ranking list against the ranking constraints. This process is repeated for all validation images, resulting in 21,863 unique visual association rules. Ranking SVM Implementation. We utilize the primal formulation of ranking SVM for our experi- ments, which is defined as: min 1/2 ||w||2 + max(0, 1 −(w, yi) + (w, yj))foryiY m, yjY m Here, is a hyperparameter that balances the objective and regularization. Results. The average MiAP outcomes across all distinct regulations are presented in Figure 3(left). We evaluate 300D GloVe vectors and word2vec vectors of dimensions 100, 300, 500, and 1000. The horizontal axis represents various regularizations used for training the ranking SVMs, with higher values indicating stronger regularization. In the 300D GloVe space and word2vec spaces of 300, 500, and 1000 dimensions, more than two ranking SVMs, with low values, produce nearly ideal ranking results (MiAP 1). This demonstrates that seen tags S are linearly rankable under almost every visual association rule, satisfying all ranking constraints set by relevant Ym and irrelevant Ym tags for image m. However, caution is advised before extending conclusions beyond the experimental vocabulary S of seen tags. While an image m imposes a visual association rule over all words, this rule leads to different partitions of distinct experimental vocabularies (e.g., seen tags S and unseen tags U). 4 Therefore, we anticipate that the principal direction for seen tags should also apply to unseen tags under the same rule, if the questions at the end of Section 3.2 are answered affirmatively. Generalization to Unseen Tags. We investigate whether the same principal direction applies to both seen and unseen tags under each visual association rule induced by an image. This is partially validated by applying the previously trained ranking SVMs to unseen tag vectors, as the ""true"" principal directions are unknown. We use the 81 unseen tags U as ""test data"" for the trained ranking SVMs, each resulting from an image-induced visual association. NUS-WIDE provides annotations for these 81 tags. The results, shown in Figure 3(right), significantly outperform the basic baseline of random tag ranking, indicating that the directions produced by SVMs are generalizable to the new vocabulary U of words. Observation. We conclude that word vectors are an effective medium for transferring knowl- edge—specifically, rank-ability along the principal direction—from seen to unseen tags. We have empirically confirmed that the visual association rule (Ym, Ym) in words due to an image m can be represented by the linear rank-ability of corresponding word vectors along a principal direction. Our experiments involve a total of |S| + |U| = 1,006 words. Future work should include larger-scale and theoretical studies. 4 Approximating the Linear Ranking Functions This section introduces our Fast0Tag approach for image tagging. Initially, we explain how to address image tagging by approximating the principal directions, based on their existence and generalization, as confirmed in the previous section. Subsequently, we describe the detailed approximation methods used. 4.1 Image Tagging by Ranking Based on the findings from Section 3, which indicate the existence of a principal direction, wm, in the word vector space for each visual association rule (Ym, Ym) generated by an image m, we propose a direct solution for image tagging. The core idea is to approximate this principal direction by learning a mapping function, f(˘00b7), that connects the visual space to the word vector space, such that: f(xm) wm Here, xm is the visual feature representation of image m. Consequently, given a test image x, we can promptly suggest a list of tags by ranking the word vectors of the tags along the direction f(x), specifically by the ranking scores: t S U, (f(x), t) This applies whether the tags are from the seen set S or the unseen set U. We investigate both linear and nonlinear neural networks to implement the approximation function f(x) w. 4.2 Approximation by Linear Regression In this approach, we assume a linear function from the input image representation x to the output principal direction w, defined as: f(x) := Ax Here, A can be determined in a closed form through linear regression. Thus, from the training data, we have: wm = Axm+m, form = 1, 2, ..., M where wmistheprincipaldirectionforalloffsetvectorsoftheseentags, correspondingtothevisualassociationrule(Ym, Y formsolutionforA. However, a challenge arises as we do not know the exact principal directions wm.ThetrainingdataonlyprovideimagesxmandrelevanttagsYm.Weoptforastraightforwardalternative, usingthedir Ax.ThefirststagetrainsarankingSV Moverthewordvectorsofseentagsforeachvisualassociation(Ym, Ym).Thesecon 5 Discussion. The use of linear transformation between visual and word vector spaces has been previously explored, for instance, in zero-shot classification and image annotation/classification. This work distinguishes itself by the clear interpretation of the mapped image f(x) = Ax as the principal direction for tag assignment, which has been empirically validated. We further extend this to a nonlinear transformation using a neural network. 4.3 Approximation by Neural Networks We also explore a nonlinear mapping f(x; ) using a multi-layer neural network, where represents the network parameters. The network architecture, illustrated in Figure 4, includes two RELU layers followed by a linear layer that outputs the approximated principal direction, w, for an input image x. We anticipate that the nonlinear mapping function f(x; ) will provide greater modeling flexibility compared to the linear approach. Training the neural network by regressing to the M directions obtained from ranking SVMs is not ideal, as confirmed by both intuition and experiments. The number of training instances, M, is small relative to the network’s parameter count, increasing the risk of overfitting. Moreover, the directions from ranking SVMs are not the true principal directions, making it unnecessary to rely on them. Instead, we integrate the two stages from Section 4.2. We aim for the neural network’s output f(xm; ) to represent the principal direction, where all relevant tag vectors p Ym rank higher than irrelevant ones n Ym for an image m. Let’s define: v(p, n; ) = (f(xm; ), n) - (f(xm; ), p) as the degree of violation of these ranking constraints. We then minimize the following loss function to train the neural network: * = argmin wm ∗l(xm, Ym; )l(xm, Ym; ) = log(1 + expv(p, n; ))forpYm, nYm where wm = 1/(|Ym|∗|Ym|)normalizestheper−imageRankNetlossbythenumberofrankingconstraintsimposedbyima batchgradientdescent. Practical Considerations. We use Theano for optimization, with a mini-batch size of 1,000 images. Each image, on average, imposes 4,600 pairwise ranking con- straints, which are all used in the optimization. The normalization wmfortheper − imagerankinglosshelpsbalancetheinfluenceofimageswithmanypositivetags, addressingtheissueofunbalancednum Besides the RankNet loss, we tested other per-image loss options, including hinge loss, Crammer- Singer loss, and pairwise max-out ranking. Hinge loss performed the worst, likely because it’s not designed for ranking. Crammer-Singer, pairwise max-out, and RankNet yielded comparable results, with RankNet slightly outperforming the others by about 2% in MiAP, possibly due to easier optimization control. Listwise ranking loss could also be considered. 5 Experiments on NUS-WIDE This section details our experimental results, comparing our method against several strong baselines for traditional image tagging on the large-scale NUS-WIDE dataset. Additionally, we evaluate our method on zero-shot and seen/unseen image tagging scenarios, extending some existing zero-shot classification algorithms and exploring variations of our approach for comparison. 5.1 Dataset and Configuration NUS-WIDE Dataset. We primarily utilize the NUS-WIDE dataset for our experiments. This dataset is a standard benchmark for image tagging, originally containing 269,648 images. We were able to retrieve 223,821 images, as some were either corrupted or removed from Flickr. Following the recommended protocol, we divide the dataset into a training set of 134,281 images and a test set of 89,603 images. We further allocate 20% of the training set as a validation set for tuning hyperparameters in both our method and the baselines, and for conducting the empirical analyses in Section 3. 6 Annotations of NUS-WIDE. NUS-WIDE provides three sets of tags for its images. The first set includes 81 ""ground truth"" tags, carefully selected to represent Flickr tags, encompassing both general terms (e.g., ""animal"") and specific ones (e.g., ""dog,"" ""flower""), and corresponding to frequent Flickr tags. These tags are annotated by students and are less noisy than those directly collected from the Web, serving as the ground truth for evaluating image tagging methods. The second and third sets contain 1,000 popular and nearly 5,000 raw Flickr tags, respectively. Image Features and Word Vectors. We extract and normalize image feature representations using VGG-19. Both GloVe and Word2vec word vectors are used in our empirical analysis in Section 3, with 300D GloVe vectors used for the remaining experiments. Word vectors are also normalized. Evaluation. We assess tagging results using two types of metrics: mean image average precision (MiAP), which considers the entire ranking list, and precision, recall, and F1-score for the top K tags in the list (K = 3 and K = 5). Both metrics are commonly used in image tagging research. For details on calculating MiAP and top-K precision and recall, we refer readers to Section 3.3 of Li et al. (2015) and Section 4.2 of Gong et al. (2013), respectively. 5.2 Conventional Image Tagging In this section, we present experimental results for traditional image tagging, using the 81 ""ground truth"" annotated concepts in NUS-WIDE to benchmark various methods. Baselines. We include TagProp as a primary competitive baseline, representing nearest-neighbor- based methods that generally outperform parametric methods built from generative models and have shown state-of-the-art results in experimental studies. We also compare against two recent parametric methods, WARP and FastTag, both based on deep architectures but using different models. For a fair comparison, we use the same VGG-19 features across all methods, with code for TagProp and FastTag provided by the authors and WARP implemented based on our neural network architecture. Additionally, we compare to WSABIE and CCA, which correlate images and relevant tags in a low-dimensional space. Hyperparameters for all methods are selected using the validation set. Results. Table 4 presents the comparison results among TagProp, WARP, FastTag, WSABIE, CCA, and our Fast0Tag models, implemented with both linear mapping and a nonlinear neural network. TagProp significantly outperforms WARP and FastTag, but its training and testing complexities are high, at O(M 2) and O(M) respectively, relative to the training set size M. In contrast, WARP and FastTag are more efficient, with O(M) training complexity and constant testing complexity due to their parametric nature. Our Fast0Tag with linear mapping yields results comparable to TagProp, while Fast0Tag with the neural network surpasses the other methods. Both implementations maintain low computational complexities similar to WARP and FastTag. Table 1: Comparison results of the conventional image tagging with 81 tags on NUS-WIDE.

Fu et al. formalised the zero-shot image tagging problem, which aims to annotate test images using a pre-defined set U of unseen tags. Our Fast0Tag naturally applies to this scenario by simply ranking the unseen tags with equation (3). Furthermore, this paper also considers seen/unseen image tagging, 7 which finds both relevant seen tags from S and relevant unseen tags from U for the test images. The set of unseen tags U could be open and dynamically growing. In our experiments, we treat the 81 concepts with high-quality user annotations in NUS-WIDE as the unseen set U for evaluation and comparison. We use the remaining 925 out of the 1000 frequent Flickr tags to form the seen set S - 75 tags are shared by the original 81 and 1,000 tags. Baselines. Our Fast0Tag models can be readily applied to the zero-shot and seen/unseen image tagging scenarios. For comparison, we study the following baselines. Seen2Unseen. We first propose a simple method that extends an arbitrary traditional image tagging method to also work with previously unseen tags. It originates from our analysis experiment in Section 3. First, we use any existing method to rank the seen tags for a test image. Second, we train a ranking SVM in the word vector space using the ranking list of the seen tags. Third, we rank unseen (and seen) tags using the learned SVM for zero-shot (and seen/unseen) tagging. LabelEM. The label embedding method achieves impressive results on zero-shot classification for fine-grained object recognition. If we consider each tag of S U as a unique class, though this implies that some classes will have duplicated images, the LabelEM can be directly applied to the two new tagging scenarios. LabelEM+. We also modify the objective loss function of LabelEM when we train the model, by carefully removing the terms that involve duplicated images. This slightly improves the performance of LabelEM. ConSE. Again by considering each tag as a class, we include a recent zero-shot classification method, ConSE in the following experiments. Note that it is computationally infeasible to compare with Fu et al., which might be the first work to our knowledge on expanding image tagging to handle unseen tags, because it considers all the possible combinations of the unseen tags. Results. Table 5 summarizes the results of the baselines and Fast0Tag when they are applied to the zero-shot and seen/unseen image tagging tasks. Overall, Fast0Tag, with either linear or neural network mapping, performs the best. Additionally, in the table, we add two special rows whose results are mainly for reference. The Random row corresponds to the case when we return a random list of tags in U for zero-shot tagging (and in U S for seen/unseen tagging) to each test image. We compare this row with the row of Seen2Unseen, in which we extend TagProp to handle the unseen tags. We can see that the results of Seen2Unseen are significantly better than randomly ranking the tags. This tells us that the simple Seen2Unseen is effective in expanding the labeling space of traditional image tagging methods. Some tag completion methods may also be employed for the same purpose as Seen2Unseen. Another special row in Table 5 is the last one with RankSVM for zero-shot image tagging. We obtain its results through the following steps. Given a test image, we assume the annotation of the seen tags, S, are known and then learn a ranking SVM with the default regularization = 1. The learned SVM is then used to rank the unseen tags for this image. One may wonder that the results of this row should thus be the upper bound of our Fast0Tag implemented based on linear regression because the ranking SVM models are the targets of the linear regression. However, the results show that they are not. This is not surprising, but rather it reinforces our previous statement that the learned ranking SVMs are not the ""true"" principal directions. The Fast0Tag implemented by the neural network is an effective alternative for seeking the principal directions. It would also be interesting to compare the results in Table 5 (zero-shot image tagging) with those in Table 4 (conventional tagging), because the experiments for the two tables share the same testing images and the same candidate tags; they only differ in which tags are used for training. We can see that the Fast0Tag (net.) results of the zero-shot tagging in Table 5 are actually comparable to the conventional tagging results in Table 4, particularly about the same as FastTag’s. These results are encouraging, indicating that it is unnecessary to use all the candidate tags for training in order to have high-quality tagging performance. Annotating images with 4,093 unseen tags. What happens when we have a large number of unseen tags showing up at the test stage? NUS-WIDE provides noisy annotations for the images with over 5,000 Flickr tags. Excluding the 925 seen tags that are used to train models, there are 4,093 remaining unseen tag",,,,,

P118.pdf,"Distant Supervision from Disparate Sources for Low-Resource Part-of-Speech Tagging Abstract We introduce DSDS: a cross-lingual neural part-of-speech tagger that learns from disparate sources of distant supervision, and realistically scales to hundreds of low- resource languages. The model exploits annotation projection, instance selection, tag dictionaries, morphological lexicons, and distributed representations, all in a uniform framework. The approach is simple, yet surprisingly effective, resulting in a new state of the art without access to any gold annotated data. 1 Introduction Low-resource languages lack manually annotated data to learn even the most basic models such as part-of-speech (POS) taggers. To compensate for the absence of direct supervision, work in crosslingual learning and distant supervision has discovered creative use for a number of alternative data sources to learn feasible models: However, only one or two compatible sources of distant supervision are typically employed. In reality severely under-resourced languages may require a more pragmatic “take what you can get” viewpoint. Our results suggest that combining supervision sources is the way to go about creating viable low-resource taggers. We propose a method to strike a balance between model simplicity and the capacity to easily integrate heterogeneous learning signals. system is a uniform neural model for POS tagging that learns from disparate sources of distant supervision (DSDS). We use it to combine: i) multi-source annotation projection, ii) instance selection, iii) noisy tag dictionaries, and iv) distributed word and sub-word representations. We examine how far we can get by exploiting only the wide-coverage resources that are currently readily available for more than 300 languages, which is the breadth of the parallel corpus we employ. DSDS yields a new state of the art by jointly leveraging disparate sources of distant supervision in an experiment with 25 languages. We demonstrate: i) substantial gains in carefully selecting high-quality instances in annotation projection, ii) the usefulness of lexicon features for neural tagging, and iii) the importance of word embeddings initialization for faster convergence. 2 Method DSDS is illustrated in Figure 1. The base model is a bidirectional long short-term memory network (bi-LSTM) Annotation projection. Ever since the seminal work of projecting sequential labels from source to target languages has been one of the most prevalent approaches to crosslingual learning. Its only requirement is that parallel texts are available between the languages, and that the source side is annotated for POS. We apply the approach by where labels are projected from multiple sources and then decoded through weighted majority voting with word alignment probabilities and source POS tagger confidences. We exploit their widecoverage Watchtower corpus (WTC), in contrast to the typically used Europarl data. Europarl covers 21 languages of the EU with 400k-2M sentence pairs, while WTC spans 300+ widely diverse languages with only 10-100k pairs, in effect sacrificing depth for breadth, and introducing a more radical domain shift. However, as our results show little projected data turns out to be the most beneficial, reinforcing breadth for depth. While selected 20k projected sentences at random to train taggers, we propose a novel alternative: selection by coverage. We rank the target sentences by percentage of words covered by word alignment from 21 sources and select the top k covered instances for training. In specific, we employ the mean coverage ranking of target sentences, whereby each target sentence is coupled with the arithmetic mean of the 21 individual word alignment coverages for each of the 21 source-language sentences. We show that this simple approach to instance selection offers substantial improvements: across all languages, we learn better taggers with significantly fewer training instances. Dictionaries. Dictionaries are a useful source or distant supervision. There are several ways to exploit such information: i) as type constraints during encoding, ii) to guide unsupervised learning, or iii) as addiional signal at training. We focus on the latter and evaluate two ways to integrate lexical knowledge into neural models, while comparing to the former wo: a) by representing lexicon properties as n-hot vector (e.g., if a word has two properties according to lexicon src, it results in a 2-hot vector, if the word is not present in src, a zero vector), with m the number of lexicon properties; b) by embedding the lexical features, i.e., is a lexicon src embedded into an /-dimensional space. We represent as concatenation of all embedded m properies of length [, and a zero vector otherwise. Tuning on the dev set, we found the second embedding approach to perform best, and simple concatenaion outperformed mean vector representations. We evaluate two dictionary sources, motivated by ease of accessibility to many languages: WIK- TIONARY, a word type dictionary that maps tokens to one of the 12 Universal POS tags; and UNIMORPH, a morphological dictionary that provides inflectional paradigms across 350 languages. For Wiktionary, we use the freely available dictionaries from The size of the dictionaries ranges from a few thousands (e.g., Hindi and Bulgarian) to 2M (Finnish UniMorph). Sizes are provided in Table 1, 1st columns. UniMorph covers between 8-38 morphological properties (for English and Finnish, respectively). Word embeddings. Embeddings are available for many languages. Pre-initialization of offers consistent and considerable performance improvements in our distant supervision setup (Section 4). We use off-the-shelf Polyglot embeddings, which performed consistently better than FastText. 3 Experiments Baselines. We compare to the following weaklysupervised POS taggers: AGIC: Multi-source annotation projection with Bible parallel data DAS: The label propagation approach by over Europarl data. GARRETTE: The approach by that works with projections, dictionaries, and unlabeled target text. LI: Wiktionary supervision. Data. Our set of 25 languages is motivated by accessibility to embeddings and dictionaries. In all experiments we work with the 12 Universal POS tags. For development, we use 21 dev sets of the Universal Dependencies 2.1. We employ UD test sets on additional languages as well as the test sets of to facilitate comparisons. Their test sets are a mixture of CoNLL and HamleDT test data, and are more distant from the training and development data. Model and parameters. We extend an off-theshelf state-of-the-art bi-LSTM tagger with lexicon information. The code is available at: https:// github.com/bplank/bilstm-aux. The parameter l=40 was set on dev data across all languages. Besides using 10 epochs, word dropout rate (p=.25) and 40-dimensional lexicon embeddings, we use the parameters from For all experiments, we average over 3 randomly seeded runs, and provide mean accuracy. For the learning curve, we average over 5 random samples with 3 runs each. 4 Results Table 1 shows the tagging accuracy for individual languages, while the means over all languages are given in Figure 2. There are several take-aways. 2 Data selection. The first take-away is that coverage-based instance selection yields substan- tially better training data. Most prior work on annotation projection resorts to arbitrary selection; informed selection clearly helps in this noisy data setup, as shown in Figure 2 (a). Training on 5k instances results in a sweet spot; more data (10k) starts to decrease performance, at a cost of runtime. Training on all WTC data (around 120k) is worse for most languages. From now on we consider the 5k model trained with Polyglot as our baseline (Table 1, column “5k”), obtaining a mean accuracy of 83.0 over 21 languages. Embeddings initialization. Polyglot initialization offers a large boost; on average +3.8% absolute improvement in accuracy for our 5k training scheme, as shown in Figure 2 (b). The big gap in low-resource setups further shows their effectiveness, with up to 10% absolute increase in accuracy when training on only 500 instances. Lexical information. The main take-away is that lexical information helps neural tagging, and embedding it proves the most helpful. Embedding Wiktionary tags reaches 83.7 accuracy on average, versus 83.4 for n-hot encoding, and 83.2 for type constraints. Only on 4 out of 21 languages are type constraints better. This is the case for only one language for n-hot encoding (French). The best approach is to embed both Wiktionary and Unimorph, boosting performance further to 84.0, and resulting in our final model. It helps the most on morphological rich languages such as Uralic. On the test sets (Table 4, right) DSDS reaches 87.2 over 8 test languages intersecting and. It reaches 86.2 over the more commonly used 8 languages of, compared to their 83.4. This shows that our novel “soft” inclusion of noisy dictionaries is superior to a hard decoding restriction, and including lexicons in neural taggers helps. We did not assume any gold data to further enrich the lexicons, nor fix possible tagset divergences. 5 Discussion Analysis. The inclusion of lexicons results in higher coverage and is part of the explanation for the improvement of DSDS; see correlation in Figure 3 (a). What is more interesting is that our model benefits from the lexicon beyond its content: OOV accuracy for words not present in the lexicon overall improves, besides the expected improvement on known OOV, see Figure 3 (b). More languages. All data sources employed in our experiment are very high-coverage. However, for true low-resource languages, we cannot safely assume the availability of all disparate information sources. Table 2 presents results for four additional languages where some supervision sources are missing. We observe that adding lexicon information always helps, even in cases where only 1k entries are available, and embedding it is usually the most beneficial way. For closely-related languages such as Serbian and Croatian, using resources for one aids tagging the other, and modern resources are a better fit. For example, using the Croatian WTC projections to train a model for Serbian is preferable over in-language Serbian Bible data where the OOV rate is much higher. How much gold data? We assume not having access to any gold annotated data. It is thus interesting to ask how much gold data is needed to reach our performance. This is a tricky question, as training within the same corpus naturally favors the same corpus data. We test both in-corpus (UD) and out-of-corpus data (our test sets) and notice an important gap: while in-corpus only 50 sentences are sufficient, outside the corpus one would need over 200 sentences. This experiment was done for a subset of 18 languages with both inand out-ofcorpus test data. Further comparison. In Table 1 we directly report the accuracies from the original contributions by DAS, LI, GARRETTE, and AGIC over the same test data. We additionally attempted to reach the scores of LI by running their tagger over the Table 1 data setup. The results are depicted in Figure 4 as mean accuracies over EM iterations until convergence. We show: i) LI peaks at 10 iterations for their test languages, and at 35 iterations for all the rest. This is in slight contrast to 50 iterations that recommend, although selecting 50 does not dramatically hurt the scores; ii) Our replication falls ˘223c5 points short of their 84.9 accuracy. There is a large 33-point accuracy gap between the scores of, where the dictionaries are large, and the other languages in Figure 4, with smaller dictionaries. Compared to DAS, our tagger clearly benefits from pre-trained word embeddings, while theirs relies on label propagation through Europarl, a much cleaner corpus that lacks the coverage of the noisier WTC. Similar applies to as they use 1-5M near-perfect parallel sentences. Even if we use much 3 Table 1: Results on the development sets and comparison of our best model to prior work.

Our paper contributes to this literature by leveraging a range of prior directions in a unified, neural test bed. Most prior work on neural sequence prediction follows the commonly perceived wisdom that hand- crafted features are unnecessary for deep learning methods. They rely on end-to-end training without resorting to additional linguistic resources. Our study shows that this is not the case. Only few prior studies investigate such sources, e.g., for MT and for POS tagging use lexicons, but only as n-hot features and without examining the cross-lingual aspect. 4 Table 2: Results for languages with missing data sources: WTC projections, Wiktionary (W), or UniMorph (U).

P120.pdf,"A Toolkit for Scrutinizing Neural Network Activations Abstract This document introduces diagNNose, an open-source toolkit designed for the examination of activations within deep neural networks. diagNNose offers a diverse collection of interpretability methods, enabling a deeper understanding of the operational dynamics of neural networks. The utility of diagNNose is showcased through an investigation into subject-verb agreement in language models. 1 Introduction We present diagNNose, a publicly available library for analyzing the behavior of deep neural networks. The diagNNose library equips researchers with tools to gain enhanced understanding of the internal representations formed by these networks, providing a comprehensive suite of established analysis methods. It accommodates a variety of model types, with a particular focus on NLP architectures, such as LSTMs and Transformers. The availability of open-source libraries has been instrumental in the advancement and wider adoption of NLP technologies. We enhance the open-source ecosystem by integrating several interpretability techniques. Recent years have witnessed significant interest in enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms by which deep neural networks function. The high-dimensional architecture of these models makes deciphering their internal dynamics a complex endeavor. This complexity has spurred the emergence of a specialized subfield within AI, dedicated to interpretability. diagNNose seeks to consolidate a range of these interpretability techniques into a unified library. The primary objective of diagNNose is to facilitate the discovery of linguistic knowledge encoded within a model’s representations. The library offers abstrac- tions that enable the investigation of recurrent models in a manner similar to Transformer models, using a modular design. It includes a module for extracting model activations. The analysis methods currently implemented in the library include targeted syntactic evaluation tasks, probing with diagnostic classifiers, and feature attributions. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the library and illustrates its application in a case study centered on subject-verb agreement within language models. Subsequently, we provide a survey of diagNNose and elaborate on its specific modules. We conclude with the case study. 2 Background The increasing capabilities of language models have resulted in a vibrant area of research focused on understanding their functionality. Approaches in this field are frequently interdisciplinary. diagNNose facilitates several influential analysis methods. 2.1 Targeted Syntactic Evaluations Language models have been central to numerous achievements in NLP. These models are trained to predict the probability of upcoming or masked tokens. To achieve success in this task, models must grasp various linguistic aspects, including syntax, semantics, and general domain knowledge. One notable area of research investigating a model’s linguistic competence employs targeted syntactic evalu- ations. This analysis method contrasts a model’s outputs on minimally different pairs of grammatical and ungrammatical constructions. If a model assigns a higher probability to the grammatical construction, it suggests an understanding of the relevant linguistic principles. diagNNose supports a diverse set of syntactic tasks and offers an interface for incorporating new tasks seamlessly. 2.2 Diagnostic Classifiers Another line of research evaluates a model’s comprehension of linguistic properties by training diagnostic classifiers on its representations. This technique, also known as probing, has yielded valuable insights into the internal mechanisms of language models. The activations used for training these classifiers are not limited to the hidden states of a language model at its top layer. There have been recent discussions regarding the extent to which high accuracy in a diagnostic classifier truly signifies that a property is actively encoded by the model. Several methods have been put forward to address this, such as using control tasks or assessing classifiers based on minimum description length. diagNNose currently supports the training of diagnostic classifiers and control tasks. 2.3 Feature Attributions While probing helps us identify specific properties embedded in model repre- sentations, it does not clarify how a model converts input features into accurate predictions. This can be addressed by calculating the contributions of input fea- tures to subsequent outputs. This is a complex task due to the high-dimensional, non-linear nature of deep learning models. Feature attributions can be calculated in various manners. One common method involves a concept from cooperative game theory, referred to as the Shapley value. Computing Shapley values is computationally intensive, leading to the develop- ment of several approximation algorithms. diagNNose currently supports feature attribution computation using Contextual Decomposition and its generalization. 3 Library Overview 3.1 Modules The library is organized into multiple modules that can be utilized as components for constructing an experimental pipeline. 3.1.1 Core Modules The foundational modules underpinning the various pipelines that can be built using diagNNose are detailed below. **models:** We offer a generalized framework for language models, enabling both recurrent and Transformer models to be accessed through a unified interface. Importing pre-trained Transformer models is accomplished using the transform- ers library. For recurrent models, we provide an interface that allows access to intermediate activations, including gate activations. **corpus:** Corpora are imported as Datasets from the torchtext package. A Corpus can be converted into an iterator for processing. Tokenization can be performed traditionally, token-by-token, or based on subword units, such as byte pair encodings. **extract:** The extraction of activations is fundamental to most analysis modules. We provide an Extractor class capable of extracting a model’s activations given a corpus. This process is not restricted to the top layer; intermediate (gate) activations can also be extracted. Activations can be dynamically saved to disk to facilitate the extraction from large corpora with limited computational resources. 2 **activations:** Extracted activations can be readily accessed using an Activation- Reader, which provides access to activations corresponding to specific subsets of corpus sentences. We also offer functionality for extracting only particular subsets of activations, based on sentence and token information. **config:** The pipeline of diagNNose is driven by configuration defined in JSON format. Individual attributes can also be directly set from the command line. 3.1.2 Analysis Modules We presently offer three primary types of experimental modules. **syntax:** The library offers capabilities for a broad range of targeted syntactic evaluation tasks. **probe:** We furnish convenient tools for training diagnostic classifiers on ex- tracted activations to probe for linguistic information that may be embedded within them. Our extraction module also enables training diagnostic classifiers on in- termediate activations, including gate activations. To address concerns that high probing accuracy does not necessarily indicate that linguistic information is actively encoded, we have incorporated functionality for Control Tasks. **attribute:** We offer capabilities for model-agnostic feature attributions, en- abling the decomposition of a model’s output into a sum of contributions. This is accomplished by implementing a wrapper over PyTorch operations, allowing intermediate feature contributions to be propagated during a forward pass. Our implementation supports various Shapley-based attribution methods and facili- tates approximation procedures such as (Generalized) Contextual Decomposition and Shapley sampling values, in addition to the exact computation of propagated Shapley values. 3.2 Requirements diagNNose can be installed using pip (pip install diagnnose) or cloned directly from the GitHub repository. The library is compatible with Python 3.6 or later, and its primary dependencies are PyTorch (v1.5+), torchtext, and HuggingFace’s transformers. diagNNose is released under the MIT License. It operates on both CPUs and GPUs and has been optimized for smaller consumer setups. The diagNNose codebase is fully typed using Python type hints and formatted using Black. All methods and classes are documented, with an overview available online. 4 Case Study: Subject-Verb Agreement To exemplify the functionality of diagNNose, we examine subject-verb agreement corpora on a selection of language models. For our experiments, we analyze the following models: BERT, RoBERTa, DistilRoBERTa, and an LSTM language model. 4.1 Corpora The corpora consist of seven tasks based on template-based syntactic constructions. These constructions feature an ""agreement attractor"" between the subject and the verb, which may mislead a language model into predicting the incorrect number of the verb. Consequently, a model must possess a robust understanding of sentence structure. The seven tasks are defined by the following templates: * SIMPLE: The athletes approve * ADV: The uncle probably avoids * 2ADV: The athlete most probably understands * COADV: The farmer overtly and deliberately knows * NAMEPP: The women near John remember * NOUNPP: The athlete beside the tables approves * NOUNPPADV: The aunt behind the bikes certainly knows 3 Each task encompasses 600 to 900 distinct sentences. Sentences are categorized into multiple conditions based on the number of the subject and the intervening noun phrase. To assess these corpora on a recurrent model, we initially compute the model’s hidden state at the verb’s position by feeding it the sub-sentence up to that point. Based on this hidden state, we compute and compare the output probabilities of the verb with the correct number (vc) and the incorrect number (vx): P(vc | he) > P(vx | he) For bi-directional masked language models, such as BERT, we cannot compute an intermediate hidden state by passing a sub-sentence because these models also incorporate input from future tokens. To address this, we substitute the verb in each sentence with a <mask> token and evaluate the model’s probabilities at this token’s position. Many contemporary language models employ BPE tokenization, which may seg- ment a word into multiple subwords. Therefore, in our experiments, we only compare verb forms where both the plural and singular forms are split into a single token. 4.2 Targeted Syntactic Evaluations We execute the targeted syntactic evaluation suite on all seven templates. The results of this experiment are presented in Table 1. Table 1: Results of the targeted syntactic evaluation tasks. Corpus Condition BERT RoBERTa DistilRoBERTa LSTM SIMPLE S 100 100 100 100 P 100 100 100 100 ADV S 100 100 100 100 P 100 100 100 99.6 2ADV S 100 100 100 99.2 P 100 100 100 99.3 COADV S 100 100 100 98.7 P 100 100 100 99.3 NAMEPP SS 93.0 75.7 81.5 99.3 PS 88.4 65.9 32.4 68.9 NOUNPP SS 95.7 88.9 98.1 99.2 SP 93.3 84.7 91.1 87.2 PS 96.7 90.6 85.3 92.0 PP 100 100 100 99.0 NOUNPPADV SS 99.6 100 100 99.5 SP 99.2 99.8 100 91.2 PS 100 100 100 99.2 PP 100 100 100 99.8 It is evident that Transformer language models generally attain higher scores compared to the LSTM model. Notably, the NAMEPP task presents a challenge for all models, with both RoBERTa and DistilRoBERTa scoring lower on this task than the LSTM. Another intriguing observation is the disparity in performance between RoBERTa and DistilRoBERTa on the NAMEPP and NOUNPP tasks. Despite DistilRoBERTa being trained to mimic RoBERTa’s behavior, its performance on a downstream task like this differs considerably. These findings can serve as a foundation for more detailed analysis. 4.3 Feature Attributions To gain a deeper understanding of why language models exhibit particularly poor performance on the NAMEPP corpus, we employ the feature attribution module on these constructions. The results for this experiment are presented below, illustrating 4 the attributions for DistilRoBERTa on an example sentence from the corpus. This highlights the differential impact of the intervening attractor on the verb’s number. The score at the top of the attribution represents the model’s full logit for that class; these logits are transformed into probabilities using SoftMax. This logit is decomposed into a sum of contributions, indicated at the bottom of each token. It can be verified that the contributions sum to the logit, which is an important characteristic of feature attribution methods, ensuring a degree of faithfulness to the model. A negative value signifies a negative feature contribution to an output class: the influence of that feature diminished the preference for the class. Feature attributions also incorporate the influence of model biases. In the provided example sentence, DistilRoBERTa produces an incorrect prediction: the logit of the incorrect singular form ’approves’ is greater than that of the plural ’approve’. The model’s error in predicting the correct verb form arises from the subject ’athletes’ not providing sufficient contribution to outweigh the negative contributions from other input features. A model with a comprehensive grasp of subject-verb agreement should assign a larger contribution to the subject when predicting the main verb. The attribute module is under active development. The exponential complexity of computing Shapley values makes generating these explanations a challenging task. 5 Conclusion diagNNose offers crucial tools for interpretability research, providing advanced analysis techniques such as diagnostic classifiers and feature attributions. The library’s modular architecture enables rapid testing of complex hypotheses and es- tablishes a robust groundwork for the development of new interpretability methods. The library’s code is open-source, and contributions are encouraged. 5",0,,,,
P121.pdf,"GPT4Tools: Reimagining LLMs as Helpers Abstract The objective of this research is to address the phenomenon of plasticity loss in deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, where neural networks lose their ability to learn effectively over time. This persistent challenge significantly hinders the long-term performance and adaptability of RL agents in dynamic environments. Existing approaches often rely on architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning, which can be computationally expensive and lack generalizability. Our work introduces a novel intervention, termed ""plasticity injection,"" designed to directly tackle the root causes of plasticity loss. This approach offers a more efficient and adaptable solution compared to existing methods. 1 Introduction The objective of this research is to address the phenomenon of plasticity loss in deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents [1, 2], where neural networks lose their ability to learn effectively over time. This persistent challenge significantly hinders the long-term performance and adaptability of RL agents in dynamic environments. Existing approaches often rely on architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning [3, 4], which can be computationally expensive and lack generalizability. Our work introduces a novel intervention, termed ""plasticity injection,"" designed to directly tackle the root causes of plasticity loss. This approach offers a more efficient and adaptable solution compared to existing methods, addressing the limitations of previous strategies that often involve extensive hyperparameter searches or complex architectural changes. The core innovation lies in its ability to proactively diagnose and mitigate plasticity loss without significantly increasing computational demands. Plasticity injection operates on three key principles. First, it provides a diagnostic framework for identifying the onset and severity of plasticity loss within an RL agent. This diagnostic capability allows for proactive intervention before performance degradation becomes significant, preventing catastrophic forgetting and maintaining consistent performance over extended training periods. The diagnostic framework leverages novel metrics that capture subtle changes in network behavior, providing early warning signals of impending plasticity loss. This proactive approach contrasts with reactive methods that only address plasticity loss after significant performance decline has already occurred. Second, plasticity injection mitigates plasticity loss without requiring an increase in the number of trainable parameters or alterations to the network’s prediction capabilities. This ensures that the computational overhead remains minimal while maintaining the integrity of the learned policy. This is achieved through a carefully designed mechanism that selectively modifies the network’s internal dynamics rather than its overall architecture. This targeted approach minimizes the risk of disrupting the agent’s learned behavior while effectively addressing the underlying causes of plasticity loss. The preservation of prediction capabilities is crucial for maintaining the agent’s performance in its operational environment. Third, the method dynamically expands network capacity only when necessary, leading to improved computational efficiency during training. This adaptive capacity allocation avoids unnecessary resource consumption during periods of stable performance. The dynamic expansion mechanism is triggered by the diagnostic framework, ensuring that resources are allocated only when needed to . address emerging plasticity loss. This adaptive approach contrasts with static methods that allocate fixed resources regardless of the agent’s learning dynamics, leading to potential inefficiencies. The dynamic nature of plasticity injection contributes to its overall efficiency and scalability. The effectiveness of plasticity injection is evaluated across a range of challenging RL benchmarks, including continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. Our results demonstrate a consistent improvement in long-term performance and learning stability compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The modular design of plasticity injection allows for easy integration with various RL algorithms and architectures, enhancing its applicability and impact on the field. Further research will explore its integration with other advanced RL techniques and its application to more complex real-world scenarios. 2 Related Work The problem of plasticity loss, or catastrophic forgetting, in neural networks has been extensively studied across various machine learning domains [1, 2]. In the context of deep reinforcement learning (RL), this phenomenon manifests as a decline in an agent’s ability to learn new tasks or adapt to changing environments after it has already acquired a certain level of proficiency. Traditional approaches to mitigate this issue often involve architectural modifications, such as employing separate networks for different tasks [3], or utilizing techniques like regularization and replay buffers [4, 5] to preserve previously learned knowledge. However, these methods can be computationally expensive, particularly for large-scale RL agents, and may not always effectively prevent plasticity loss in complex scenarios. Furthermore, many existing methods focus on reactive solutions, addressing plasticity loss only after it has already occurred, rather than proactively preventing it. Our work differs significantly by introducing a proactive diagnostic framework coupled with a targeted intervention that minimizes computational overhead. Several studies have explored the use of dynamic network architectures to improve the efficiency and adaptability of RL agents [6, 7]. These approaches often involve mechanisms for adding or removing neurons or layers based on the agent’s performance or the complexity of the environment. However, these methods typically focus on optimizing the network’s overall structure rather than directly addressing the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss. In contrast, our plasticity injection method selectively modifies the network’s internal dynamics without altering its overall architecture, allowing for a more targeted and efficient approach to mitigating plasticity loss. This targeted approach avoids the potential disruption of learned policies that can occur with more drastic architectural changes. The dynamic capacity expansion in our method is also triggered by a diagnostic framework, ensuring that resources are allocated only when necessary, unlike many existing dynamic architecture methods that may allocate resources inefficiently. Another line of research focuses on improving the stability and robustness of RL training through techniques such as curriculum learning [8] and meta-learning [9]. Curriculum learning gradually introduces increasingly complex tasks to the agent, allowing it to build a robust foundation of knowledge before tackling more challenging problems. Meta-learning aims to train agents that can quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal training data. While these methods can indirectly contribute to mitigating plasticity loss by improving the agent’s overall learning stability, they do not directly address the specific mechanisms underlying the phenomenon. Our approach complements these methods by providing a targeted intervention that directly tackles the root causes of plasticity loss, enhancing the effectiveness of existing training strategies. The diagnostic component of our framework also offers valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss, which can inform the development of even more effective training strategies. The concept of ""plasticity"" itself has been extensively studied in neuroscience [10, 11], where it refers to the brain’s ability to adapt and reorganize its structure and function in response to experience. Our work draws inspiration from these neuroscientific findings, aiming to emulate the brain’s ability to dynamically adjust its internal mechanisms to maintain learning capacity over time. However, unlike biological systems, our approach focuses on developing computationally efficient and scalable methods for achieving this dynamic adaptation in artificial neural networks. The modular design of our plasticity injection framework allows for easy integration with various RL algorithms and architectures, making it a versatile tool for enhancing the robustness and longevity of RL agents across a wide range of applications. Future research will explore the integration of plasticity injection 2 with other advanced RL techniques, such as hierarchical RL and multi-agent RL, to further expand its applicability and impact. 3 Methodology The core of our approach, termed ""plasticity injection,"" revolves around three interconnected compo- nents: a diagnostic framework, a mitigation strategy, and a dynamic capacity allocation mechanism. These components work in concert to proactively identify, address, and adapt to the onset of plasticity loss in RL agents. The diagnostic framework continuously monitors key network metrics during training, providing early warning signals of potential plasticity loss. These metrics are carefully selected to capture subtle changes in network behavior that might precede significant performance degradation. We employ a combination of established metrics, such as learning rate decay and loss function fluctuations, alongside novel metrics specifically designed to detect subtle shifts in the network’s internal representations. These novel metrics are based on analyzing the distribution of activations within different layers of the network, providing a more granular understanding of the network’s internal dynamics. The choice of metrics is informed by our preliminary experiments and theoretical analysis of plasticity loss mechanisms. The diagnostic framework outputs a plasticity score, a continuous value reflecting the severity of detected plasticity loss. This score serves as a trigger for the mitigation and capacity allocation mechanisms. Our mitigation strategy focuses on selectively modifying the network’s internal dynamics rather than its overall architecture. This targeted approach avoids the computational overhead and potential disruption of learned policies associated with architectural modifications. The strategy involves a carefully designed set of operations applied to the network’s weight matrices and biases. These operations are guided by the plasticity score, with stronger interventions applied when the score indicates a higher level of plasticity loss. The specific operations are chosen to enhance the network’s ability to learn new information without disrupting previously acquired knowledge. We explore several different operation types, including weight normalization, regularization techniques, and targeted pruning of less relevant connections. The optimal set of operations and their parameters are determined through a hyperparameter search conducted on a subset of our benchmark tasks. The effectiveness of the mitigation strategy is evaluated by comparing the long-term performance of agents with and without plasticity injection. The dynamic capacity allocation mechanism complements the mitigation strategy by adaptively expanding the network’s capacity only when necessary. This mechanism is triggered by the plasticity score, with the degree of capacity expansion directly proportional to the severity of detected plasticity loss. The capacity expansion is implemented by adding new neurons or layers to the network, with the specific architecture of the added components determined based on the nature of the detected plasticity loss. For instance, if the diagnostic framework identifies a loss of capacity in a specific layer, new neurons are added to that layer. This targeted approach ensures that resources are allocated efficiently, avoiding unnecessary computational overhead during periods of stable performance. The added capacity is integrated seamlessly into the existing network architecture, minimizing disruption to the learned policy. The effectiveness of the dynamic capacity allocation is evaluated by comparing the computational efficiency and long-term performance of agents with and without this mechanism. The entire plasticity injection framework is implemented as a modular component that can be easily integrated with various RL algorithms and architectures. This modularity allows for flexibility and adaptability to different RL tasks and environments. The framework is designed to be computationally efficient, minimizing the overhead associated with diagnosis, mitigation, and capacity allocation. The computational efficiency is achieved through careful optimization of the algorithms and data structures used in each component. The framework’s performance is evaluated across a range of challenging RL benchmarks, including continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. The results demonstrate a consistent improvement in long-term performance and learning stability compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our experimental setup involves a rigorous evaluation across diverse RL environments, encompassing both continuous control tasks and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). We compare the performance of RL agents employing plasticity injection against several state-of-the-art baselines, including those utilizing established techniques for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. The evaluation metrics include long-term performance, learning stability, and computational efficiency. 3 We analyze the results to assess the effectiveness of each component of the plasticity injection framework and to identify potential areas for future improvement. The detailed experimental results and analysis are presented in the Results section. 4 Experiments Our experimental evaluation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of plasticity injection in mitigating plasticity loss and enhancing the long-term performance of RL agents. We conduct experiments across a diverse set of challenging RL environments, encompassing both continuous control tasks and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). These environments represent a range of complexities, requiring agents to adapt to varying degrees of uncertainty and dynamic changes. The selection of these environments ensures a robust evaluation of the generalizability and robustness of our proposed method. We compare the performance of RL agents employing plasticity injection against several state-of-the-art baselines, including those utilizing established techniques for mitigating catastrophic forgetting, such as experience replay and regularization methods. The baselines are carefully selected to represent a range of existing approaches, allowing for a comprehensive comparison. The experimental setup is designed to isolate the effects of plasticity injection, ensuring that any observed performance improvements can be directly attributed to our proposed method. We meticulously control for confounding factors, such as hyperparameter settings and training procedures, to maintain the integrity of the experimental results. The evaluation metrics employed in our experiments include long-term performance, learning stability, and computational efficiency. Long-term performance is measured by the average cumulative reward obtained by the agent over an extended training period. Learning stability is assessed by analyzing the variance in the agent’s performance over time, with lower variance indicating greater stability. Computational efficiency is evaluated by measuring the training time and resource consumption of the agents. These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the overall effectiveness of plasticity injection. We utilize statistical tests, such as t-tests and ANOVA, to determine the statistical significance of the observed performance differences between the agents with and without plasticity injection. The significance level is set at α = 0.05 for all statistical tests. The detailed results of these statistical analyses are presented in the following subsections. To further analyze the effectiveness of each component of the plasticity injection framework, we conduct ablation studies. These studies involve systematically removing individual components of the framework and evaluating the resulting performance. By comparing the performance of the full framework to the performance of the framework with individual components removed, we can isolate the contribution of each component to the overall performance improvement. This allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the interplay between the diagnostic framework, the mitigation strategy, and the dynamic capacity allocation mechanism. The results of these ablation studies provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of the plasticity injection framework. The findings from these studies inform future improvements and refinements to the framework.

The results indicate that plasticity injection not only improves performance but also enhances computational efficiency. These findings support the effectiveness of our proposed method in addressing plasticity loss in RL agents. Further detailed analysis of the results, including statistical significance tests and ablation study results, are provided in the supplementary material. 5 Results Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of plasticity injection in mitigating plas- ticity loss and enhancing the long-term performance and learning stability of reinforcement learning (RL) agents. We conducted experiments across a diverse set of challenging RL environments, includ- ing continuous control tasks (e.g., MuJoCo tasks such as HalfCheetah, Ant, Hopper) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) (e.g., variations of the gridworld environment with hidden states). These environments were chosen to represent a range of complexities and to rigorously test the generalizability of our approach. We compared the performance of RL agents utilizing plasticity injection against several state-of-the-art baselines, including those employing experience replay [4, 5] and regularization techniques [3]. The baselines were carefully selected to represent a range of existing approaches for addressing catastrophic forgetting, allowing for a comprehensive comparison. Our experimental setup was designed to isolate the effects of plasticity injection, ensuring that any observed performance improvements could be directly attributed to our proposed method. We meticulously controlled for confounding factors, such as hyperparameter settings and training procedures, to maintain the integrity of the experimental results. All experiments were run with three different random seeds for each environment and baseline, and the results were averaged. The evaluation metrics included long-term performance (average cumulative reward over 1000 episodes), learning stability (measured by the standard deviation of cumulative reward over the last 200 episodes), and computational efficiency (training time and memory usage). Long-term performance was chosen to directly assess the ability of the method to prevent plasticity loss over extended training. Learning stability was included to quantify the consistency of performance over time. Computational efficiency was evaluated to demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach. We employed statistical tests, specifically paired t-tests, to determine the statistical significance of the observed performance differences between agents with and without plasticity injection. The significance level was set at α = 0.05 for all statistical tests. Table 3: Average Cumulative Reward and Standard Deviation Across Different Environments Environment Plasticity Injection (Mean ± Std) Baseline (Mean ± Std) HalfCheetah-v3 10200 ± 500 8500 ± 700 Ant-v3 6500 ± 400 5000 ± 600 Hopper-v3 3200 ± 200 2500 ± 300 Gridworld-POMDP-A 90 ± 5 75 ± 10 Gridworld-POMDP-B 110 ± 8 90 ± 12 Table 1 presents a summary of our experimental results. The results consistently demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in average cumulative reward when plasticity injection is employed across all environments (p<0.05 for all environments). Furthermore, the standard deviation of the cumulative reward was significantly lower for agents using plasticity injection, indicating improved learning stability. These findings strongly support the effectiveness of our proposed method in mitigating plasticity loss and enhancing the long-term performance of RL agents. Detailed results, including individual episode rewards and learning curves, are provided in the supplementary material. To further analyze the contribution of each component of the plasticity injection framework, we conducted ablation studies. These studies involved systematically removing individual components (diagnostic framework, mitigation strategy, dynamic capacity allocation) and evaluating the resulting performance. The results (detailed in the supplementary material) showed that all three components contributed significantly to the overall performance improvement. Removing any single component resulted in a substantial decrease in both average cumulative reward and learning stability, highlighting 5 the synergistic interaction between the components. The dynamic capacity allocation mechanism proved particularly crucial in maintaining computational efficiency while preventing performance degradation in complex environments. The diagnostic framework effectively identified the onset of plasticity loss, allowing for timely intervention by the mitigation strategy. This combination of proactive diagnosis and targeted mitigation proved highly effective in preventing catastrophic forgetting and maintaining consistent performance over extended training periods. The modular design of plasticity injection allows for easy integration with various RL algorithms and architectures, enhancing its applicability and impact on the field. 6",0,,,,
P122.pdf,"Short-Term Forecasting of Precipitation Using Satellite Data Abstract Short-range forecasting of rain or snow, known as precipitation nowcasting, is typically displayed on geographical maps by weather services for up to a 2-hour timeframe. Current methods for precipitation nowcasting predomi- nantly use the extrapolation of ground-based radar observations, employing techniques like optical flow or neural networks. However, the effectiveness of these methods is geographically restricted to areas surrounding radar installations. This paper introduces a novel precipitation nowcasting technique that utilizes geostationary satellite imagery. This method has been integrated into the Yandex.Weather precipitation map, which includes an alert system with push notifications for Yandex ecosystem products. The integration of satellite imagery significantly broadens the coverage area, marking a step towards developing a comprehensive global nowcasting service. 1 Introduction Weather conditions significantly impact the daily routines and planning of urban populations. Similar to how ancient humans relied on environmental cues for hunting, modern individuals adjust their daily and leisure activities based on the likelihood of rain or cloud cover. Weather forecasting services provide essential data, including temperature, precipitation intensity and type, cloudiness, humidity, pressure, and wind conditions. These services offer current weather updates, short-term predictions up to 2 hours (nowcasting), medium-range forecasts up to 10 days, and long-range predictions spanning several months. A crucial component of weather services is the precipitation map, which combines radar data with neural network-based, very short-term precipitation forecasting to deliver a detailed map of anticipated precipitation for the next two hours, updated every 10 minutes. This feature enables personalized, user-friendly notifications, such as alerts about impending rain. The popularity of this feature is evident, as it significantly influences user engagement and reliance on weather services. The information from the precipitation map is used to refine current weather condition reports (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy) on the main weather website. Additionally, partners and offline users, including radio and television, depend on this data, effectively doubling the audience for the precipitation nowcasting product. Traditional weather forecasting, which involves numerical modeling of the atmosphere, cannot accurately predict exact rain locations on short time scales. For instance, it struggles to determine which part of a city will be affected by rain within the next hour. Moreover, traditional methods provide hourly updates, making it difficult to pinpoint brief periods without rain during short, intense precipitation events. People often need straightforward answers to simple questions like when it will rain or stop raining, requiring specific predictions such as ""heavy rain will start in 10 minutes and last for 30 minutes."" Conventional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are limited in their ability to forecast precipitation events at specific locations and times. Radar extrapolation products are effective for the first couple of hours but fail to predict precipitation accurately due to physical processes. Consequently, the current trend in nowcasting is to merge high-resolution radar data with traditional NWP models. However, radar-based products are limited by the location of radar installations and are not easily scalable. Radars are costly, their installation requires governmental and public approval, and their operation needs trained personnel. Coverage is particularly sparse in large, unevenly populated countries like Russia, where many remote areas lack the necessary infrastructure. Similar challenges exist in many developing countries that need weather services but lack the infrastructure for radar networks. The objective of this research is to develop and implement a practical system for precipitation nowcasting that relies on satellite imagery and NWP products. The goal is to replicate the precipitation fields obtained from radar using satellite data and then to provide nowcasting over a much larger area using a similar predictive model. The system’s effectiveness is validated by comparing predicted precipitation with data from ground-based weather stations. The primary focus areas with limited radar coverage are the Siberian and Ural federal districts of Russia, which have a combined population of approximately 30 million. 2 Related Work This section provides an overview of related work, divided into two main parts corresponding to the primary components of our pipeline. 2.1 Precipitation detection The global and continuous coverage offered by geostationary satellite imagery makes it a highly desirable data source for precipitation nowcasting algorithms. Since satellites do not directly observe rainfall, precipitation data must be extracted using heuristic or machine learning methods. This extraction can be framed as either precipitation estimation (regression) or precipitation detection (binary classification). This paper concentrates on the binary classification approach to precipitation detection. The interaction of light with the atmosphere, specifically absorption and scattering, is governed by established physical principles. These principles can be used to develop heuristics for detecting precipitation. One such implementation is the multi-sensor precipitation estimate (MPE), which is, however, limited to detecting convective rain and may produce inaccurate results in areas with other forms of precipitation. This limitation is particularly significant in middle and high latitudes, where convective precipitation is predominantly a summer phenomenon resulting from surface heating, leading to the formation of cumulonimbus clouds and heavy rainfall. During much of the year, frontal precipitation, driven by cyclonic movements and interactions between warm and cold fronts, is more common. The MPE algorithm often fails to capture these frontal precipitation events. A more advanced physics-based heuristic is the precipitation properties (PP) algorithm, which integrates NWP model data, cloud physical properties, and satellite measurements. This algorithm uses radar observations to calibrate its parameters. However, because it relies on satellite observations at visible wavelengths to determine cloud properties, it can only retrieve precipitation data during daylight hours. Machine learning techniques, including decision trees, neural networks, and SVMs, have been evaluated for precipitation detection. However, these studies often used pixel-wise data splits for training and testing, which may lead to overfitting due to neglecting the spatial and temporal smoothness of atmospheric phenomena. While these studies examined day, twilight, and night conditions separately, with the best results during the day, a more sophisticated method using a fully-connected stacked denoising autoencoder has also been applied to precipitation detection. Although the autoencoder’s unsupervised training helps mitigate overfitting, there is no comparison with other architectures. From a machine learning perspective, precipitation detection is similar to semantic segmentation, where a multichannel image is input, and each pixel is assigned an output label. Convolutional neural networks have become the standard for semantic segmentation in recent years, making them a natural choice for precipitation detection as well. Convolutional neural networks have been effectively used in various satellite image processing tasks, such as road and building detection. Despite numerous public challenges that have advanced the field, the range of architectures used for aerial image processing remains narrower compared to those used for semantic segmentation datasets like Microsoft COCO or Cityscapes. A common issue in these datasets is the presence of objects of the same class at different scales, which has led to the development of multiscale approaches. However, these approaches are less applicable to precipitation detection and other satellite imagery tasks, as the distance between the sensor and the Earth’s surface is usually known. Consequently, simpler models like UNet and fully-convolutional ResNet remain relevant. 2.2 Nowcasting Precipitation nowcasting is typically accomplished in two stages by extrapolating radar observations. Initially, wind patterns are estimated by comparing multiple precipitation fields captured by radar. The techniques used for this in meteorology are similar to optical flow estimation algorithms in computer vision. Subsequently, the precipitation field is moved according to the estimated wind directions. A novel approach to nowcasting using a convolutional recurrent neural network (Conv-LSTM) was introduced and later refined. While this neural network adds complexity, it can theoretically improve rainfall prediction accuracy by accounting for radar artifacts and the appearance or disappearance of precipitation areas. However, the most significant of these processes, the vanishing of precipitation, can also be managed by adding basic filtering to the optical flow method. 3 Methodology This section details the methodology used for precipitation detection and nowcasting, focusing on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation metrics. 2 3.1 Data Sources Precipitation nowcasting imposes distinct data requirements compared to Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), including high spatial and temporal resolution, direct rainfall measurement, and global coverage. Since no single source can fulfill all these requirements, it is necessary to combine multiple data sources. Weather stations provide direct precipitation observations, typically measuring accumulated precipitation every 12 hours according to the SYNOP protocol. Although many stations report more frequently, usually every 3 hours, this frequency is insufficient for nowcasting due to the lack of detailed spatial and temporal data needed to generate high-resolution precipitation fields. Radar observations are the primary source of high-resolution precipitation data. The Russian network of DMRL-C radars, operated by Roshydromet, uses C-band Doppler technology to measure raindrop reflectivity and radial velocity. Each radar covers a circular area with a radius of up to 250 km and 10 km above the ground, with accuracy diminishing with distance. The radar echo can be converted to surface precipitation using the Marshall-Palmer relation. The resulting precipitation field has a resolution of 2 x 2 km, with scans repeated every ten minutes. However, radar coverage is limited, especially outside densely populated areas of Europe and North America, with most Russian radars located in the western part of the country. Low Earth orbit satellites equipped with radars and sensors provide another source of precipitation measurements. These satellites scan a narrow band beneath their orbital path, offering global coverage in the sense that every location within a certain latitude range is eventually scanned. However, the time between consecutive passes of a single satellite can be quite long. The Global Precipitation Measurements (GPM) mission, operated by NASA and JAXA, uses a constellation of about 10 operational satellites to provide global precipitation coverage from 65°S to 65°N with a 3-hour temporal resolution. Geostationary satellites are widely used for weather observation. Positioned 35,786 km above the equator, these satellites match the Earth’s rotation, allowing continuous monitoring of a large area. However, at such altitudes, the only feasible instrument for cloud and precipitation detection is a high-resolution imager that captures visible and infrared spectrum snapshots. Accurately detecting precipitation from these images is challenging. Previous studies on this topic have not achieved the accuracy needed for user-facing products that aim to alert users about precipitation within 10 minutes. This study uses data from the Meteosat-8 satellite, operated by EUMETSAT, positioned over the Indian Ocean at 41.5° longitude, covering the western part of Russia and Europe. The SEVIRI instrument on Meteosat-8 scans the Earth’s surface in 12 channels, with a spatial resolution of 3 km per pixel and a full scan time of 15 minutes. This paper describes a precipitation nowcasting system that integrates radar, satellite, and NWP model data. A new approach to precipitation detection is introduced and its accuracy is demonstrated. 3.2 Precipitation Detection The approach to precipitation detection is summarized in Table 1. The key components of the pipeline are described in detail in the following subsections. Table 1: Summary of our precipitation detection approach. Input features Satellite imagery, GFS fields, solar altitude, topography Ground truth Binarized radar measurements Model UNet Loss function Binary crossentropy + Dice loss Evaluation measure F1 score 3.2.1 Preprocessing The data preparation process involves several steps aimed at minimizing the discrepancies between different data domains. Radar data preprocessing begins by discarding radar observations taken beyond 200 km from the radar, as these are deemed unreliable. Subsequently, observations from various radars are consolidated onto a single map, resolving any conflicts between radars with overlapping coverage areas. Due to frequent false negatives in radar observations, the maximum value between two data points is used for aggregation. Finally, radar observations are binarized using three thresholds: 0.08 mm/h for light rain, 0.5 mm/h for moderate rain, and 2.5 mm/h for heavy rain. Satellite images and radar observations are remapped onto a uniform grid using an equirectangular projection. Given the oblique observation angles and the fact that precipitation can occur up to 2 km above the ground, there can be a parallax shift of up to 3 pixels between radar and satellite data. However, in practice, accurately estimating precipitation height is complex, and accounting for parallax did not improve the alignment. Satellite and radar data have different observation frequencies: satellite images are available every 15 minutes, while radar images are available every 10 minutes. To align these data sources temporally, a frame rate conversion is implemented using optical flow interpolation. The goal is to match the radar data’s temporal resolution, so satellite data is converted to a 10-minute time 3 step. However, optical flow cannot be directly computed from satellite imagery due to the presence of both transient atmospheric phenomena and the permanent underlying relief. This issue is circumvented by performing precipitation detection before the optical flow step, allowing the optical flow to be computed directly from the precipitation detection results, which do not include the relief. To generate the missing image It between two adjacent anchor images taken at times t0 and t1, the following equation is used: It(r) = aIt0(r + bu01) + bIt1(r + au10) where a = t1−t t1−t0 and b = t−t0 t1−t0 are coefficients dependent on the time of the generated image, and u01 and u10 are the forward and backward optical flows, computed using the TV-L1 optical flow algorithm implemented in OpenCV. Roshydromet radars record the timestamp at the end of a scan, whereas EUMETSAT marks the start. Since the Earth is scanned in a series of lateral sweeps starting from the south, the actual observation time varies with latitude, with northern latitudes observed last. The combined discrepancy between timestamps can reach 20 minutes. Experimental validation has confirmed that this value corresponds to the minimum discrepancy between radar data and precipitation field reconstruction. Additional features are incorporated into the satellite imagery to enhance the signal. The Global Forecast System (GFS) model is used to provide a comprehensive description of atmospheric conditions, including physical properties not easily inferred from satellite imagery. The GFS model produces forecasts four times a day with a spatial resolution of 0.25° x 0.25° and temporal intervals of 3 hours. Key fields from GFS include convective precipitation rate, cloud work function, cloud water, precipitable water, and convective potential energy at different levels. Additionally, a topography map and solar altitude data are included as features. 3.2.2 Training A modified UNet architecture is employed as the primary model for precipitation detection. Through testing, it was determined that using 5 upsample/downsample blocks, compared to the original 4, yields the best results on the validation dataset. The model utilizes standard 3x3 convolutions, 2x2 pooling, and batch normalization layers. The number of channels begins at 16 in the first block and doubles with each downsampling step. This reduced number of channels helps mitigate overfitting and accelerates training and evaluation. The network is trained for 250,000 iterations using the Adam algorithm, with an initial learning rate of 10−4, which is reduced by a factor of 10 after 200,000 iterations. The addition of the Dice loss to the standard binary cross-entropy improves the F1 scores for the converged model. Training is performed using the Keras framework with a TensorFlow backend and Horovod for multi-GPU learning. The model is trained to detect three levels of precipitation (light, medium, and heavy) simultaneously, producing three output maps with binary classification loss applied to each map independently. Typically, precipitation estimation algorithms are developed separately for day, twilight, and night conditions. However, this separation is challenging for machine learning in high-latitude zones due to the underrepresentation of night during summer and day during winter, making it difficult to compile a balanced dataset. Therefore, a single model is trained, with solar altitude provided as an additional input feature. Overfitting is a significant concern due to the limited geographical area of the dataset. The network can easily memorize the relief, which is visible in some wavelengths even if not explicitly provided as a feature, and use it to overfit on ground truth labels within the radar coverage areas. Moreover, memorizing the correspondence between geographical location and output labels may cause the model to ignore areas outside radar coverage, leading to constant output in these regions. This contradicts the goal of extending nowcasting beyond radar coverage. To address this, the model is trained on relatively small data crops (96x96 pixels). Due to the large number of channels in the input data, which is atypical for computer vision problems, data loading can be slow. To manage this, a small batch of 5 multi-channel images (including all additional features) is loaded, and each image is then cropped 10 times at random locations. 3.2.3 Metrics This section presents the evaluation metrics for the precipitation detection algorithm. Due to class imbalance, standard classification accuracy is not informative. Therefore, the primary metric used is the F1 score, averaged across temporal and spatial dimensions. Several approaches are compared: - **UNet with GFS**: The UNet architecture with a complete set of features, trained as described earlier. - **UNet w/o GFS**: The same UNet approach without GFS features. - **Pointwise**: A neural network with two convolutional layers using 1x1 convolutions, equivalent to a pointwise perceptron model. GFS features are not used in this model. - **PP and MPE**: Physics-based algorithms (Precipitation Properties and Multi-sensor Precipitation Estimate). Given that PP and MPE algorithms are designed for daylight conditions, the metrics are also averaged separately for day, night, and twilight periods. The neural network approaches consistently outperform the physics-based methods across all time periods and metrics. The generally poor performance of PP and MPE in these experiments may be due to their tuning for predicting convective rainfall aggregated over extended periods, which does not align with the requirements of this service. 4 The pointwise model’s performance falls between that of UNet and the physics-based approaches. Since it is trained on radar data, it detects similar types of precipitation and performs well during testing. The UNet architecture’s superiority over the pointwise model likely stems from its ability to gather information from a large receptive field. While precipitation reconstruction does not require the same extent of multiscale data processing as many semantic segmentation tasks, the interconnectedness of adjacent atmospheric locations makes a large receptive field beneficial for precipitation detection. Finally, the addition of GFS features further enhances the F1 score of the UNet model, as demonstrated in the results. 4 Experiments 4.1 Nowcasting Upon completing the reconstruction of the precipitation field in the area of interest, a separate algorithm is employed to forecast future precipitation fields based on several consecutive reconstructed fields. Two options are considered for this algorithm: extrapolation with optical flow, as used for frame rate conversion, and a convolutional neural network previously developed for radar data prediction. The network consists of a sequence of blocks, each modeling the extrapolation process with optical flow via a spatial transformer layer. Although the neural network’s prediction mechanism is intentionally similar, end-to-end learning on real data theoretically allows it to surpass the performance of simpler algorithms. While the neural network approach was found to be superior in the single radar setting, preliminary experiments did not show the same success with composited radar images and satellite data. Despite the optical flow approach being simpler and not requiring retraining with the introduction of new data sources, it is believed that neural nowcasting remains promising and could outperform simpler techniques with proper tuning of the network architecture and training regimen. 5 Results 5.1 Post-Launch Performance Although the satellite-based rain detection model was trained to match radar fields, its reception by users was uncertain. A/B testing alone was insufficient to evaluate the product’s performance, as it was essentially a new feature for several regions of Russia and could be well-received initially even if the map quality was low. Therefore, the performance of the new precipitation map was assessed using ground station data. While the optimal metrics for a user-facing precipitation prediction algorithm are still debated, there was evidence of the nowcasting product’s popularity, and the aim was to replicate the properties of the radar-based precipitation map using satellite data. Specifically, the radar data differs from longer-term forecasts based on proprietary Meteum technology in having higher accuracy and lower systematic error rates (precipitation imbalance) at the cost of a lower F1 score when compared to ground station weather observations. The same comparison strategy was used to evaluate the performance of the new satellite-based rain detection algorithm over the federal districts of Russia. Results showed that while the accuracy of the satellite-based product is lower than that of radar, it is still better than traditional forecasts, with precipitation imbalance and F1 scores similar to those for radar. It is important to note that the radar located in Siberia was used only for verification at this stage; its data was not included in the training dataset. This comparison allows for evaluating precipitation detection quality in regions without radar observation. This result confirmed the success of the new rain map. Additionally, A/B testing on users showed a statistically significant increase in daily active users (DAU) in areas where the rain map was previously unavailable (Siberia and Ural regions), justifying its rollout in late September.

The system employs advanced machine learning algorithms and incorporates the physical properties of the atmosphere and ground surface based on NWP models. The inclusion of satellite data enables nowcasting for areas not covered by ground-based radars, achieving quality comparable to traditional radar-based nowcasts. 5 Table 3: Comparison of F1 scores of precipitation detection methods during different time periods.

Compared to previous solutions, the potential audience has been expanded from approximately 70 million to 300 million people, based on coverage area and population density. The approach can be extended to the rest of the Meteosat-8 coverage area. Scaling the technology to other geostationary satellites with similar measurement systems, such as Himawari and GOES, offers the possibility of providing global precipitation nowcasting and alerting services worldwide. However, differences in weather patterns across geographical regions will likely necessitate retraining the detection model and adjusting the set of input features. One encountered problem is the sharp edge between radar and satellite data. This stationary edge on the weather map can confuse users, indicating the need for more sophisticated data fusion techniques. Experiments with image blending to erase conflicting observations along the border and inpainting the missing parts have been conducted. 7 Acknowledgments The success of this work and the product is attributed to the support, assistance, and hard work of a large team.

P123.pdf,"Acquiring Cross-Domain Representations for Contextual Detection Using Extensive Emoji Data Abstract This research delves into the application of a vast collection of emoji occurrences to acquire versatile representations applicable to diverse domains for the purpose of identifying sentiment, emotion, and sarcasm. Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks frequently encounter limitations due to the deficiency of manually labeled data. In the realm of social media sentiment analysis and associated tasks, researchers have thus employed binarized emoticons and specific hashtags as a means of distant supervision. Our study demonstrates that by broadening distant supervision to include a more varied array of noisy labels, models can achieve richer representations. Through emoji prediction on a dataset encompassing 1,246 million tweets, each including one of 64 prevalent emojis, we achieve state-of- the-art results on eight benchmark datasets focusing on sentiment, emotion, and sarcasm detection, all with the aid of a singular pre-trained model. Our findings affirm that the diversity inherent in our emotional labels leads to an enhancement in performance compared to previous distant supervision methods. 1 Introduction This paper addresses the challenge that numerous Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks face due to the lack of sufficient manually annotated data. Consequently, emotional expressions that co-occur with text have been utilized for distant supervision in sentiment analysis and related tasks within social media. This allows models to acquire valuable text representations before directly modeling these specific tasks. For example, state-of-the-art methods for sentiment analysis in social media frequently use positive and negative emoticons to train their models. Similarly, in prior research, hashtags like #anger, #joy, #happytweet, #ugh, #yuck, and #fml have been categorized into emotional labels for use in emotion analysis. The practice of using distant supervision on noisy labels often leads to enhanced performance in the target task. In this paper, we present evidence that expanding distant supervision to a more varied selection of noisy labels enables models to develop more detailed representations of emotional content in text. This, in turn, improves performance on benchmark datasets designed for the detection of sentiment, emotions, and sarcasm. We further demonstrate that the representations learned by a single pre-trained model can be successfully generalized across five different domains. Table 1 showcases example sentences which were scored by our model. For every sentence, the five most probable emojis are displayed, alongside the model’s estimated probabilities. Emojis do not always function as straightforward labels of emotional content. For instance, a positive emoji might clarify an ambiguous sentence or supplement text that might otherwise be seen as somewhat negative. While this is true, our results demonstrate that emojis can still be used to accurately categorize the emotional content of texts in numerous scenarios. Our DeepMoji model, for instance, is able to capture various interpretations of the word ’love’ and slang terms like ’this is the shit’ as having positive connotations (as illustrated in Table 1). To enable others to explore the prediction capabilities of our model, we have made an online demonstration available at deepmoji.mit.edu. Our work makes the following contributions: We demonstrate that a vast number of readily accessible emoji occurrences on Twitter can be used to pre-train models for richer emotional representation than is typically achieved through distant supervision. We then transfer this learned knowledge to target tasks using a novel layer-wise fine-tuning approach. This technique yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in areas such as emotion, sarcasm, and sentiment detection. Through extensive analyses on the influence of pre-training, our results highlight that the variety present in our emoji set plays a crucial role in the transfer learning capabilities of our model. We have made our pre-trained DeepMoji model publicly available to aid in a range of NLP tasks. 2 Related work The use of emotional expressions as noisy labels in text to address the scarcity of labels is not a new concept. Initially, binarized emoticons served as noisy labels, but subsequent research has utilized hashtags and emojis. Previous studies have always manually determined which emotional category each emotional expression should belong to. Prior efforts have made use of emotion theories, such as Ekman’s six basic emotions and Plutchik’s eight basic emotions. Such manual categorization necessitates an understanding of the emotional content inherent to each expression, which can be challenging and time-consuming for complex emotional combinations. Furthermore, any manual selection and categorization carries the potential for misinterpretations and might overlook essential details concerning usage. In contrast, our methodology requires no prior knowledge of the corpus and can capture the diverse usage of 64 emoji types (Table 1 presents examples, and Figure 3 shows how the model implicitly organizes emojis). An alternative approach to automatically interpreting the emotional content of an emoji involves learning emoji embeddings from the words defining emoji-semantics, as found in official emoji tables. In our study, this approach has two significant limitations: (a) It requires emojis to be present during testing, whereas several domains have limited or no emoji usage. (b) The tables fail to capture the dynamic nature of emoji use, such as shifts in an emoji’s intended meaning over time. Knowledge from the emoji dataset can be transferred to target tasks in several ways. Multi-task learning, which involves training on multiple datasets at once, has been shown to have promising results. However, multi-task learning requires access to the emoji dataset whenever the classifier needs to be adjusted for a new target task. Requiring access to the dataset can be problematic when considering data access regulations. Data storage issues also arise, as the dataset used in this study comprises hundreds of millions of tweets (see Table 2). Instead, we use transfer learning which does not require access to the original dataset. 3 Method 3.1 Pretraining In many instances, emojis function as a stand-in for the emotional content of text. Therefore, pre- training a model to predict which emojis were initially part of a text can improve performance in the target task. Social media contains many short texts that use emojis which can be used as noisy labels for pretraining. We used data from Twitter spanning from January 1, 2013, to June 1, 2017, but any data set containing emoji occurrences could be used. The pretraining data set uses only English tweets that do not contain URLs. We think the content obtained from the URL is important for understanding the emotional content of the text in the tweet. Because of this we expect emojis associated with tweets containing URLs to be noisier labels than those in tweets without URLs, therefore the tweets with URLs have been removed. Proper tokenization is crucial for generalization. All tweets are tokenized word-by-word. Words containing two or more repeated characters are shortened to the same token (for example, ‘loool’ and ‘looooool’ are tokenized as the same). We also use a special token for all URLs (which is relevant only for the benchmark datasets), user mentions (for example, ‘@acl2017’ and ‘@emnlp2017’ are treated the same), and numbers. To be included in the training set, a tweet must have at least one token that is not a punctuation mark, emoji, or special token. 2 Many tweets repeat the same emoji or contain multiple distinct emojis. To address this in our training data, for each unique emoji type, we save a separate tweet for pretraining, using that emoji type as the label. Regardless of the number of emojis associated with the tweet, we save only a single tweet for the pretraining for each unique emoji type. This pre-processing of data enables the pretraining to capture that multiple kinds of emotional content can be associated with the tweet. It also makes our pretraining task a single-label classification instead of a more complex multi-label classification. To ensure that the pretraining encourages the models to learn a thorough understanding of the emotional content of text instead of just the emotional content associated with frequently used emojis, we create a balanced pretraining dataset. The pretraining data is split into training, validation, and test sets. The validation and test sets are randomly sampled such that each emoji is represented equally. The remaining data is upsampled to generate a balanced training dataset. 3.2 Model With the availability of millions of emoji occurrences, we are able to train expressive classifiers with a limited risk of overfitting. We utilize a variant of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which has been successful in numerous NLP tasks. Our DeepMoji model uses an embedding layer with 256 dimensions to project each word into a vector space. A hyperbolic tangent activation function is used to ensure each embedding dimension remains within the range [-1, 1]. To understand each word in the context of the text, we use two bidirectional LSTM layers with 1024 hidden units each (512 in each direction). Lastly, we employ an attention layer that accepts all these layers as input through skip connections. (Figure 1 presents an illustration). The attention mechanism enables the model to determine the importance of each word for the prediction task by weighting the words as it creates the text representation. A word like ""amazing"" is highly informative of the emotional meaning of a text and so should be treated accordingly. We use a basic method, taking inspiration from prior work, with a single parameter for each input channel: ei = hiwa ai = exp(ei) P j=1 exp(ej) v = X aihi (1) Here, ht stands for the representation of the word at time step t, and wa is the weight matrix for the attention layer. The attention importance scores for each time step, at, are determined by multiplying the representations by the weight matrix, and then normalizing them to establish a probability distribution across the words. Finally, the text’s representation vector, v, is found using a weighted summation over all time steps, with the attention importance scores used as weights. The representation vector that comes from the attention layer is a high-level encoding of the whole text. This is used as input into the final Softmax layer for classification. We have found that the addition of the attention mechanism and skip connections enhances the model’s capabilities for transfer learning. The only form of regularization used for the pretraining is L2 regularization with a coefficient of 10−6 on the embedding weights. For fine-tuning, further regularization is applied. We implemented our model using Theano and have made an easy-to-use version available that utilizes Keras. 3.3 Transfer learning Our pre-trained model can be fine-tuned for a target task in several ways. Some methods involve ‘freezing’ layers by disabling parameter updates to prevent overfitting. One popular approach is to utilize the network as a feature extractor, where all model layers except the final one are frozen during fine-tuning (we will call this the ""last"" approach). An alternative method is to use the pre- trained model for initialization, where the full model is unfrozen (which we will refer to as the ‘full’ approach). We put forward a new, simple transfer learning approach we are calling ""chain-thaw."" This approach sequentially unfreezes and fine-tunes one layer at a time. It increases accuracy on the target task, but requires more computational power for the fine-tuning process. By separately training each layer, the model can adjust individual patterns across the network while reducing the risk of overfitting. It appears that this sequential fine-tuning has a regularizing effect, similar to the layer-wise training explored for unsupervised learning. 3 More specifically, the chain-thaw approach starts by fine-tuning any new layers (often only a Softmax layer) to the target task until the validation set converges. Then, the approach individually fine-tunes each layer, starting with the first layer in the network. Lastly, the entire model is trained with all layers. Each time the model converges (as measured on the validation set), the weights are restored to their optimal setting, preventing overfitting in a similar manner to early stopping. Figure 2 illustrates this process. If only step a) in the figure is performed, this is the same as the ‘last’ approach, where the existing network is used as a feature extractor. Likewise, only performing step d) is the same as the ‘full’ approach, where the pre-trained weights are used as the initialization for a fully trainable network. While the chain-thaw procedure may seem extensive, it can be implemented with just a few lines of code. Also, the added time spent on fine-tuning is not large, when considering the use of GPUs on small datasets of manually annotated data which is often the case. The chain-thaw approach has the benefit of expanding the vocabulary to new domains with a low risk of overfitting. For a given dataset, up to 10,000 new words from the training set are added to the vocabulary. Table 2 shows the number of tweets in the pretraining dataset associated with each emoji in millions. 4 Experiments 4.1 Emoji prediction We use a raw dataset of 56.6 billion tweets, which is filtered down to 1.2 billion relevant tweets. In the pretraining dataset, a single copy of a tweet is stored for every unique emoji, resulting in a dataset with 1.6 billion tweets. Table 2 shows the distribution of tweets across different emoji types. We used a validation set and a test set, both containing 640K tweets (10K of each emoji type), to evaluate performance on the pretraining task. The remaining tweets were used for the training set, which was balanced using upsampling. The performance of the DeepMoji model on the pretraining task was evaluated, with the results shown in Table 3. We use both top 1 and top 5 accuracy for the evaluation as the emoji labels are noisy and multiple emojis can potentially be appropriate for a given sentence. For comparison purposes, we also train a version of our DeepMoji model with smaller LSTM layers and a bag-of-words classifier, fastText, which has recently shown competitive results. We use a 256 dimension vector for the fastText classifier, making it almost identical to only using the embedding layer from the DeepMoji model. The difference in top 5 accuracy between the fastText classifier (36.2%) and the largest DeepMoji model (43.8%) highlights the difficulty of the emoji prediction task. Since the two classifiers only differ in that the DeepMoji model has LSTM layers and an attention layer between the embedding and the Softmax layer, this difference in accuracy demonstrates the importance of capturing each word’s context. Table 3 displays the accuracy of classifiers on the emoji prediction task. The value d refers to the dimensionality of each LSTM layer and the parameters are given in millions. Model Params Top 1 Top 5 Random - 1.6% 7.8% fasttext 12.8 12.8% 36.2% DeepMoji (d=512) 15.5 16.7% 43.3% DeepMoji (d=1024) 22.4 17.0% 43.8% Table 1: Accuracy of classifiers on the emoji prediction task. d refers to the dimensionality of each LSTM layer. Parameters are in millions. 4.2 Benchmarking We evaluate our method on 3 distinct NLP tasks using 8 datasets across 5 domains. For fair comparison, DeepMoji is compared to other methods that utilize external data sources in addition to the benchmark dataset. We used an averaged F1 measure across classes for evaluating emotion analysis and sarcasm detection, as these consist of unbalanced datasets. Sentiment datasets are evaluated using accuracy. 4 Many benchmark datasets have an issue with data scarcity, especially in emotion analysis. Many studies that introduce new methods for emotion analysis often evaluate their performance on a single benchmark dataset, SemEval 2007 Task 14, which contains only 1250 data points. There has been criticism regarding the use of correlation with continuous ratings as a measure, making only the somewhat limited binary evaluation possible. We only evaluate the emotions Fear, Joy, Sadness because the remaining emotions are found in less than 5 To fully assess our method on emotion analysis, we make use of two other datasets. First, a dataset of emotions in tweets about the Olympic Games, created by Sintsova et al. which we convert to a single-label classification task. Second, a dataset of self-reported emotional experiences from a large group of psychologists. Because these two datasets have not been evaluated in prior work, we compare against a state-of-the-art approach based on a valence-arousal-dominance framework. The scores extracted using this framework are mapped to the classes in the datasets using logistic regression with cross-validation parameter optimization. We have made our preprocessing code available so that these two datasets may be used for future benchmarking in emotion analysis. We assessed the performance of sentiment analysis using three benchmark datasets. These small datasets were chosen to highlight the significance of the transfer learning capabilities of the evaluated models. Two datasets, SS-Twitter and SS-Youtube, are from SentiStrength and follow the relabeling as described by prior work to create binary labels. The third dataset is from SemEval 2016 Task4A. Because tweets are often deleted from Twitter, the SemEval dataset has experienced data decay. This makes comparisons across papers difficult. Approximately 15 The current state of the art in sentiment analysis on social media (and winner of SemEval 2016 Task 4A) uses an ensemble of convolutional neural networks that are pre-trained on a private dataset of tweets with emoticons. This makes it difficult to replicate. As a substitute, we pre-train a model that uses the hyperparameters of the largest model in their ensemble on the positive/negative emoticon dataset. Using this pretraining as an initialization, we fine-tune the model on the target tasks, utilizing early stopping based on a validation set. We implemented Sentiment-Specific Word Embeddings (SSWE), using embeddings available on the authors’ website, but found that it performed worse than the pretrained convolutional neural network, and these results have been excluded. Table 4 presents a description of the benchmark datasets. Datasets that did not have pre-existing training/test splits were split by us, and these splits are publicly available. Data from the training set was used for hyperparameter tuning.

Datasets without pre-existing training/test splits are split by us (with splits publicly available). Data used for hyperparameter tuning is taken from the training set. For sarcasm detection, we used versions 1 and 2 of the sarcasm dataset from the Internet Argument Corpus. It should be noted that the results from these benchmarks that are shown elsewhere are not directly comparable, as only a subset of the data is available online. We establish a state-of-the-art baseline by modeling embedding-based features alongside unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams with an SVM. GoogleNews word2vec embeddings are used to compute the embedding-based features. Cross-validation was used to perform a hyperparameter search for regularization parameters. The sarcasm dataset version 2 includes both a quoted text and a sarcastic response, but only the response was used to keep models consistent across the datasets. 5 Table 5 displays a comparison across benchmark datasets. The reported values are averages across 5 runs. Variations refer to the transfer learning approaches that we discussed, and ’new’ refers to a model trained without pretraining.

Reported values are averages across five runs. Variations refer to transfer learning approaches with ‘new’ being a model trained without pretraining. We used the Adam optimizer for training, with the gradient norm clipped to 1. For training all new layers, we set the learning rate to 10−3 and to 10−4 when fine-tuning any pre-trained layers. To prevent overfitting on the small datasets, 10 Table 5 demonstrates that the DeepMoji model outperforms the state of the art across all the benchmark datasets and that our new ‘chain-thaw’ method yields the highest transfer learning performance. The results are averaged across 5 runs to reduce the variance. We confirm statistical significance using bootstrap testing with 10,000 samples, our model performance was statistically better than the state-of-the-art across all benchmark datasets (p < 0.001). Our model exceeds the performance of the state of the art even on datasets that come from different domains than the tweets that the model was pre-trained on. A crucial difference between the pretraining dataset and the benchmark datasets is the length of the observations. The average number of tokens per tweet in the pretraining dataset is 11. Meanwhile, board posts from the Internet Argument Corpus version 1 (for example), have an average of 66 tokens, with some posts being much longer. 5 Model Analysis 5.1 Importance of emoji diversity A key difference between this work and prior research that used distant supervision is the variety in noisy labels. For example, other studies only used positive and negative emoticons as noisy labels. Other studies used more nuanced sets of noisy labels, but our set is the most varied known to us. To investigate the effect of using a diverse set of emojis, we created a subset of our pretraining data that included tweets with one of 8 emojis, which are similar to the positive/negative emoticons used in other work. Because the dataset based on this reduced set of emojis contains 433 million tweets, any performance differences on benchmark datasets are more likely linked to the diversity of the labels than to differences in dataset sizes. We trained our DeepMoji model to predict whether tweets contained positive or negative emojis, and we evaluated this pre-trained model on benchmark datasets. We call this the DeepMoji-PosNeg model. To assess the emotional representations learned by the two pre-trained models, we used the ‘last’ transfer learning approach to allow the models to map already learned features to classes in the 6 target datasets. Table 6 shows that DeepMoji-PosNeg performs worse than DeepMoji across all 8 benchmarks. This demonstrates that the diversity of our emoji types enables the model to acquire richer representations of emotional content in text, which in turn is more useful for transfer learning. Table 6 compares benchmarks using a smaller emoji set (Pos/Neg emojis) or a standard architecture (standard LSTM). Results for DeepMoji from Table 5 have been added for comparison. The evaluation metrics are the same as in Table 5. Reported values are averages across 5 runs.

Results for DeepMoji from Table 5 are added for convenience. Evaluation metrics are as in Table 5. Reported values are the averages across five runs. Many emojis express similar emotional content, but have subtle variations in usage that our model can capture. By using hierarchical clustering on the correlation matrix of the DeepMoji model’s predictions on the test set, we can see that the model captures many expected similarities (Figure 3). For example, the model groups emojis into broad categories related to negativity, positivity, or love. It also differentiates within these categories. For example, mapping sad emojis to one subcategory of negativity, annoyed emojis to another subcategory, and angry emojis to a third. 5.2 Model architecture Our DeepMoji model architecture employs an attention mechanism and skip connections, which assist in transferring learned representations to new domains and tasks. Here, we compare the DeepMoji model architecture to a standard 2-layer LSTM. Both were compared using the ‘last’ transfer learning approach, and all regularization and training parameters were consistent. Table 6 shows that the DeepMoji model performs better than a standard 2-layer LSTM across all the benchmark datasets. These two architectures performed equally on the pretraining task. This indicates that the DeepMoji model architecture is better for transfer learning, even if it is not necessarily better for a single supervised classification task with an abundance of available data. We believe that the improvements in transfer learning can be attributed to two factors: (a) The attention mechanism with skip connections provides straightforward access to learned low-level features for any time step, making it easy to use this information if needed for a new task. (b) The skip connections improve the gradient flow from the output layer to the early layers in the network. This is useful when parameters in early layers are adjusted as a part of transfer learning to small datasets. Further analysis of these factors in future work would allow us to confirm why our architecture outperforms a standard 2-layer LSTM. 5.3 Analyzing the effect of pretraining The target task’s performance benefits significantly from pretraining, as shown in Table 5. Here, we separate the effects of pretraining into two factors: word coverage and phrase coverage. These two effects provide regularization to the model, preventing overfitting (the supplementary material includes a visualization of this regularization). There are multiple ways of expressing sentiment, emotion, or sarcasm. Because of this, the test set may contain language use not present in the training set. Pretraining helps the target task models focus on low-support evidence by having already seen similar language in the pretraining dataset. To examine this effect, we measure the improvement in word coverage on the test set when using 7 pretraining. Word coverage is defined as the percentage of words in the test dataset that were also seen in the training/pretraining dataset (as shown in Table 7). One key reason that the ‘chain-thaw’ approach outperforms other transfer learning approaches is its ability to tune the embedding layer with a low risk of overfitting. Table 7 shows how adding new words to the vocabulary as part of the tuning process increased word coverage. It is important to note that word coverage can be misleading in this context. In many small datasets, a word may occur only once in the training set. In contrast, all the words in the pretraining vocabulary are present in thousands or even millions of observations, enabling the model to learn a good representation of the emotional and semantic meaning. Therefore, the benefits of pretraining for word representations likely extend beyond the differences seen in Table 7. Table 7 shows the word coverage on benchmark test sets. This compares the use of only the vocabulary generated by finding words in the training data (‘own’), the pretraining vocabulary (‘last’), or a combination of both vocabularies (‘full / chain-thaw’). Dataset Own Last Full / Chain-thaw SE0714 41.9% 93.6% 94.0% Olympic 73.9% 90.3% 96.0% PsychExp 85.4% 98.5% 98.8% SS-Twitter 80.1% 97.1% 97.2% SS-Youtube 79.6% 97.2% 97.3% SE1604 86.1% 96.6% 97.0% SCv1 88.7% 97.3% 98.0% SCv2-GEN 86.5% 97.2% 98.0% Table 5: Word coverage on benchmark test sets using only the vocabulary generated by finding words in the training data (‘own’), the pretraining vocabulary (‘last’) or a combination of both vocabularies (‘full / chain-thaw’). To analyze how important capturing phrases and the context of each word are, we evaluated the accuracy on the SS-Youtube dataset using a fastText classifier that was pre-trained using the same emoji dataset as our DeepMoji model. This fastText classifier is similar to only using the embedding layer from the DeepMoji model. We then evaluated the representations learned by fine-tuning the models as feature extractors (using the ‘last’ transfer learning approach). The fastText model achieved an accuracy of 63 5.4 Comparing with human-level agreement To see how well our DeepMoji classifier performs compared to humans, we created a dataset of randomly selected tweets that were annotated for sentiment. Each tweet was annotated by a minimum of 10 English-speaking Amazon Mechanical Turkers (MTurks) who lived in the USA. The tweets were rated on a scale from 1 to 9, with a ‘Do not know’ option. Guidelines were provided to the human raters. The tweets were selected to contain only English text and no mentions or URLs, so they could be rated without extra contextual information. Tweets where more than half the evaluators chose ‘Do not know’ were removed (98 tweets). For every tweet, we randomly select a single MTurk rating as the ‘human evaluation.’ We average the remaining nine MTurk ratings to make the ground truth. The ‘sentiment label’ for a given tweet is thus defined as the overall consensus among raters, excluding the randomly selected ‘human evaluation’ rating. To ensure clear separation between the label categories, we removed neutral tweets that fell within the interval [4.5, 5.5] (roughly 29 Table 8 shows that the agreement of the random MTurk rater is 76.1 Table 8 compares the agreement between classifiers and the aggregate opinion of Amazon Mechanical Turkers on sentiment prediction of tweets. 8 Model Agreement Random 50.1% fastText 71.0% MTurk 76.1% DeepMoji 82.4% Table 6: Comparison of agreement between classifiers and the aggregate opinion of Amazon Mechan- ical Turkers on sentiment prediction of tweets. 6 Conclusion We have demonstrated how the abundance of text on social media containing emojis can be used to pre-train models. This enables them to acquire representations of emotional content in text. Our findings demonstrate that the diversity of our emoji set is crucial to our method’s performance. This was found by comparing the model performance against an identical model that was pre-trained on a subset of emojis. Our pre-trained DeepMoji model is available for other researchers to use for diverse emotion-related NLP tasks. 9",0,,,,
P124.pdf,"Predictive Maintenance in Smart Grids Using Time-Series Analysis: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Enhance Grid Reliability Abstract Predictive maintenance in smart grids has become a crucial aspect of ensuring reliable and efficient energy distribution, and time-series analysis has emerged as a key approach in achieving this goal. By leveraging advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, it is possible to analyze historical data and predict potential faults or failures in the grid, allowing for proactive maintenance and minimizing downtime. However, our research takes an unconventional approach by incorporating elements of chaos theory and fractal analysis to identify intricate patterns in the time-series data, which may not be immediately apparent through traditional methods. This innovative methodology enables us to detect subtle anomalies and predict equipment failures with unprecedented accuracy, even when the data exhibits seemingly erratic behavior. Furthermore, our approach also involves analyzing the grid’s energy distribution patterns in relation to celestial events, such as lunar cycles and solar flares, which have been found to have a surprisingly significant impact on the grid’s stability. The integration of these diverse factors enables us to develop a comprehensive predictive maintenance framework that not only optimizes energy distribution but also provides a new perspective on the complex interplay between technological and environmental systems. 1 Introduction The advent of smart grids has revolutionized the way electricity is distributed and consumed, enabling real-time monitoring and control of the grid’s operations. A critical component of smart grid management is predictive maintenance, which involves identifying potential faults and scheduling maintenance activities to minimize downtime and optimize resource allocation. Time-series analysis has emerged as a key enabler of predictive maintenance in smart grids, allowing grid operators to analyze historical data and forecast future trends and patterns. By leveraging time-series analysis, grid operators can detect anomalies, predict equipment failures, and schedule maintenance activities to minimize the risk of power outages and reduce maintenance costs. The application of time-series analysis in predictive maintenance is not without its challenges, however. One of the primary difficulties is the complexity and variability of time-series data, which can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including weather patterns, seasonal fluctuations, and unexpected events. Furthermore, the analysis of time-series data often requires significant computational resources and expertise, which can be a barrier to adoption for smaller grid operators. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of predictive maintenance in smart grids are substantial, and researchers have been exploring a range of innovative approaches to improve the accuracy and efficiency of time-series analysis. One such approach involves the use of fractal theory to analyze time-series data, which has been shown to reveal hidden patterns and structures that are not apparent through traditional analysis techniques. By applying fractal theory to time-series data, researchers have been able to identify complex patterns and relationships that can inform predictive maintenance activities. For example, the fractal dimension of a time-series signal can be used to predict the likelihood of equipment failure, with higher fractal dimensions indicating a greater risk of failure. This approach has been shown to be particularly effective in predicting failures in complex systems, such as power transformers and transmission lines. In addition to fractal theory, researchers have also been exploring the application of chaos theory to time-series analysis, which involves the study of complex and dynamic systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. By analyzing time-series data through the lens of chaos theory, researchers have been able to identify complex patterns and relationships that can inform predictive maintenance activities. For example, the Lyapunov exponent of a time-series signal can be used to predict the likelihood of equipment failure, with higher Lyapunov exponents indicating a greater risk of failure. This approach has been shown to be particularly effective in predicting failures in systems that are subject to high levels of uncertainty and variability. Another innovative approach to predictive maintenance involves the use of time-series data to train artificial intelligence models that can predict equipment failures and schedule maintenance activities. This approach has been shown to be highly effective in a range of applications, including predictive maintenance of wind turbines and power generation equipment. By training artificial intelligence models on historical time-series data, grid operators can identify patterns and relationships that are not apparent through traditional analysis techniques, and use this information to inform predictive maintenance activities. For example, an artificial intelligence model trained on time-series data from a wind turbine can predict the likelihood of gear box failure, and schedule maintenance activities to minimize downtime and reduce maintenance costs. Interestingly, some researchers have also been exploring the application of seemingly unrelated fields, such as music theory and culinary arts, to time-series analysis. For example, the use of musical composition techniques, such as sonata form and rhythm, has been shown to reveal hidden patterns and structures in time-series data. Similarly, the application of culinary arts, such as recipe development and ingredient selection, has been used to inform the development of predictive maintenance strategies. While these approaches may seem unorthodox, they have been shown to be highly effective in certain applications, and highlight the potential for innovation and creativity in the field of predictive maintenance. The use of unorthodox approaches to time-series analysis is not without its challenges, however. One of the primary difficulties is the lack of a theoretical framework to support these approaches, which can make it difficult to interpret and validate the results. Furthermore, the application of unorthodox approaches often requires significant expertise and creativity, which can be a barrier to adoption for grid operators. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of innovative approaches to time-series analysis are substantial, and researchers continue to explore new and unconventional methods for analyzing and interpreting time-series data. In conclusion, the application of time-series analysis to predictive maintenance in smart grids is a complex and multifaceted field, with a wide range of approaches and techniques available. From traditional methods, such as autoregressive integrated moving average models, to more innovative approaches, such as fractal theory and chaos theory, researchers continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in predictive maintenance. While there are certainly challenges to be addressed, the potential benefits of predictive maintenance in smart grids are substantial, and the continued development of innovative approaches to time-series analysis will be critical to realizing these benefits. 2 Related Work Predictive maintenance in smart grids has garnered significant attention in recent years, with a plethora of research endeavors striving to develop innovative time-series analysis techniques. A considerable body of work has focused on leveraging traditional machine learning algorithms, such as autoregressive integrated moving average models and exponential smoothing, to forecast energy demand and detect potential grid anomalies. However, these approaches often fall short in capturing the intricate complexities and nonlinearities inherent in smart grid operations. 2 Some researchers have explored the application of more advanced techniques, including deep learning architectures and ensemble methods, to improve the accuracy and robustness of predictive mainte- nance models. For instance, a study employed a hybrid approach combining long short-term memory networks with wavelet transform to forecast energy consumption patterns, yielding remarkably accurate results. Conversely, another investigation delved into the realm of chaos theory, utilizing the Lyapunov exponent to analyze the complexities of grid dynamics, although the findings were somewhat ambiguous and difficult to interpret. In a rather unconventional approach, a team of investigators attempted to apply the principles of fractal geometry to model the self-similar patterns inherent in energy demand time series. Although the results were intriguing, with the fractal dimension appearing to correlate with peak demand periods, the methodology was not without its criticisms, as some argued that the underlying assumptions were flawed and the analysis was overly simplistic. Furthermore, a separate study took a decidedly unorthodox approach, using a combination of astrology and machine learning to predict energy demand, with the authors claiming that lunar cycles and planetary alignments had a tangible impact on grid operations. While the results were largely inconclusive and sparked intense debate, the study did serve to highlight the importance of considering external factors in predictive maintenance models. Moreover, the increasing prevalence of renewable energy sources and distributed generation has introduced new complexities and challenges to predictive maintenance in smart grids. As such, researchers have begun to explore the development of more sophisticated time-series analysis tech- niques, incorporating elements of uncertainty quantification and robust optimization to account for the inherent variability and intermittency of renewable energy sources. Additionally, the integration of advanced sensor technologies and IoT devices has enabled the collection of vast amounts of data, which can be leveraged to develop more accurate and informative predictive models. In a surprising turn of events, a research team discovered that the application of certain types of music, specifically classical compositions with a strong emphasis on rhythm and melody, appeared to have a profound impact on the accuracy of predictive maintenance models. The authors hypothesized that the repetitive patterns and harmonies present in the music helped to synchronize the brainwaves of the researchers, allowing them to develop more intuitive and effective models. While the findings were met with a mix of amusement and skepticism, they did serve to highlight the often-overlooked importance of creativity and intuition in the development of predictive maintenance models. The proliferation of smart grid technologies has also led to an increased focus on the development of more advanced data analytics platforms, capable of handling the vast amounts of data generated by these systems. As such, researchers have begun to explore the application of big data analytics and cloud computing to predictive maintenance, leveraging the scalability and flexibility of these platforms to develop more comprehensive and integrated models. Moreover, the use of advanced visualization techniques, such as virtual and augmented reality, has been proposed as a means of facilitating more effective communication and collaboration among stakeholders, allowing for more informed decision-making and improved predictive maintenance outcomes. In conclusion, the realm of predictive maintenance in smart grids using time-series analysis is a complex and multifaceted one, with a wide range of approaches and techniques being explored. While some methods have yielded promising results, others have been met with criticism and skepticism. Nevertheless, the continued development and refinement of these techniques is crucial to the efficient and reliable operation of smart grids, and it is likely that future research will yield even more innovative and effective solutions to the challenges posed by predictive maintenance. 3 Methodology Predictive maintenance in smart grids is a complex task that involves analyzing time-series data from various sources, including sensors, meters, and other monitoring devices. To tackle this challenge, we propose a multi-step approach that combines traditional time-series analysis techniques with some unconventional methods. First, we collect and preprocess the data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and normalizing the time series. This step is crucial in ensuring that the data is consistent and reliable, which is essential for accurate predictions. We also apply a novel technique called ""data whispering,"" which involves playing soothing music to the data to calm down any erratic 3 patterns. This approach may seem unorthodox, but it has been shown to reduce the noise in the data and improve the overall quality of the time series. Next, we apply various time-series analysis techniques, including autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, exponential smoothing (ES), and seasonal decomposition. These methods help us identify patterns and trends in the data, which are essential for predicting future values. However, we also introduce a new technique called ""time-series astrology,"" which involves analyzing the position of the stars and planets to identify correlations with the time-series data. This approach may seem bizarre, but it has been shown to provide interesting insights into the underlying dynamics of the system. For example, we found that the alignment of the planets has a significant impact on the electricity demand during peak hours. In addition to these traditional and unconventional methods, we also propose a new framework for predictive maintenance in smart grids. This framework involves using a combination of machine learning algorithms, including neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines. These algorithms are trained on the preprocessed data and are used to predict the likelihood of equipment failure or other maintenance-related events. However, we also introduce a new algorithm called ""random guessing,"" which involves randomly selecting a prediction from a set of possible outcomes. This approach may seem illogical, but it has been shown to provide surprisingly accurate results in certain situations. To further improve the accuracy of our predictions, we propose a novel technique called ""human- machine collaboration."" This involves collaborating with human experts in the field of predictive maintenance to validate and refine the predictions made by the machine learning algorithms. However, we also introduce a new approach called ""machine-machine collaboration,"" which involves using multiple machines to collaborate with each other to make predictions. This approach may seem flawed, but it has been shown to provide interesting insights into the underlying dynamics of the system. For example, we found that the collaboration between two machines can lead to the discovery of new patterns and trends in the data that were not visible before. The proposed framework also involves using a variety of evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the predictive maintenance system. These metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which provide a comprehensive overview of the system’s performance. However, we also propose a new metric called ""predictive maintenance happiness index,"" which involves measuring the overall satisfaction of the maintenance personnel with the predictions made by the system. This approach may seem irrelevant, but it has been shown to provide valuable insights into the human factors that influence the adoption and effectiveness of predictive maintenance systems. Overall, the proposed methodology provides a comprehensive framework for predictive maintenance in smart grids using time-series analysis. The combination of traditional and unconventional methods, machine learning algorithms, and human-machine collaboration provides a powerful approach for predicting equipment failure and other maintenance-related events. While some of the approaches may seem unorthodox or flawed, they have been shown to provide interesting insights and accurate predictions, which can be used to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of smart grids. The use of soothing music, astrology, and random guessing may seem bizarre, but they have been shown to provide valuable contributions to the field of predictive maintenance, and their results should not be ignored. 4 Experiments In order to validate the efficacy of our proposed time-series analysis framework for predictive maintenance in smart grids, we conducted an exhaustive set of experiments on a comprehensive dataset comprising power consumption patterns from various regions. The dataset was carefully curated to include diverse seasonal and climatic conditions, thereby ensuring the robustness and generalizability of our model. Our experimental setup consisted of a simulated smart grid environment, where we mimicked real-world power distribution scenarios using advanced computational tools. We commenced our experiments by applying a range of time-series analysis techniques, including autocorrelation analysis, spectral analysis, and wavelet analysis, to identify underlying patterns and trends in the power consumption data. Notably, our autocorrelation analysis revealed a peculiar phenomenon, wherein the power consumption patterns exhibited a strong correlation with the lunar 4 cycle, particularly during periods of full moon. This unexpected finding prompted us to explore the potential relationship between lunar cycles and power consumption, which led us to incorporate lunar phase data into our predictive model. To further enhance the accuracy of our model, we employed a novel approach involving the use of fractal geometry to analyze the self-similarity of power consumption patterns at different temporal scales. This unconventional method allowed us to uncover intricate patterns and structures in the data that would have otherwise remained undetected. Moreover, we discovered that the fractal dimensions of the power consumption time series were inversely proportional to the frequency of maintenance outages, suggesting a previously unknown relationship between the complexity of power consumption patterns and the reliability of the grid. In addition to these innovative approaches, we also investigated the application of traditional machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines and random forests, to predict maintenance needs based on time-series data. However, our results showed that these conventional methods were outperformed by our proposed time-series analysis framework, which achieved a remarkable prediction accuracy of 97.42 The following table summarizes the results of our experiments, highlighting the performance of our proposed framework in comparison to traditional machine learning approaches: Our findings suggest Table 1: Comparison of Predictive Maintenance Models Model Prediction Accuracy Mean Absolute Error Root Mean Squared Error Proposed Framework 97.42% 2.15 3.17 Support Vector Machine 82.11% 4.21 5.67 Random Forest 85.67% 3.93 5.23 Fractal Geometry Approach 91.25% 2.97 4.13 that the incorporation of unconventional variables, such as unicorn airspeed velocity, and innovative approaches, like fractal geometry analysis, can significantly enhance the predictive performance of maintenance models in smart grids. Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of considering unexpected relationships and patterns in time-series data, which can lead to the development of more accurate and reliable predictive maintenance frameworks. Ultimately, our research contributes to the growing body of knowledge in the field of predictive maintenance, providing new insights and perspectives on the application of time-series analysis in smart grids. To further elucidate the complex relationships between power consumption patterns, lunar cycles, and unicorn airspeed velocity, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the spectral properties of the time-series data. This involved the application of advanced signal processing techniques, including short-time Fourier transforms and wavelet packet decomposition, to extract relevant features and patterns from the data. Our analysis revealed a fascinating phenomenon, wherein the spectral characteristics of the power consumption time series were found to be intimately related to the harmonic frequencies of the lunar cycle, with a notable peak in spectral power corresponding to the full moon phase. Moreover, our research also explored the potential applications of chaos theory and complexity science in the context of predictive maintenance in smart grids. By analyzing the Lyapunov exponents and fractal dimensions of the power consumption time series, we were able to identify early warning signs of impending maintenance needs, thereby enabling proactive measures to be taken to prevent potential outages and disruptions. This innovative approach has significant implications for the development of more resilient and reliable smart grid systems, and underscores the importance of considering complex, nonlinear dynamics in the analysis of time-series data. In conclusion, our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed time-series analysis frame- work for predictive maintenance in smart grids, and highlight the importance of considering un- conventional variables and innovative approaches in the development of more accurate and reliable maintenance models. The unexpected relationships and patterns uncovered in our research have significant implications for the field of predictive maintenance, and underscore the need for continued innovation and exploration in this rapidly evolving area of research. 5 5 Results The results of our study show a significant reduction in symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among military veterans who underwent virtual reality (VR)-enhanced therapy. The therapy, which involved exposure to simulated combat environments, was found to be effective in reducing anxiety and depression in 75 One of the most surprising findings of our study was the effectiveness of the ""virtual reality pet"" com- ponent, which involved participants interacting with a virtual dog or cat in a simulated environment. This component was found to be particularly effective in reducing stress and anxiety, with 90 In addition to the virtual reality pet component, our study also investigated the use of ""scent-enabled"" virtual reality environments, which involved the release of specific scents, such as lavender or vanilla, during the therapy sessions. This approach was found to be highly effective in reducing anxiety and stress, with 85 The data from our study was collected through a combination of surveys, interviews, and physiological measures, such as heart rate and skin conductance. The results show a significant reduction in symptoms of PTSD among the participants, with a mean reduction of 30 The following table summarizes the results of our study: Table 2: Summary of Results Component Reduction in Symptoms Improvement in Quality of Life Participant Engagement VR-Enhanced Therapy 30% 80% 90% Virtual Reality Pet 40% 85% 95% Scent-Enabled Virtual Reality 35% 80% 90% Overall, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of VR-enhanced therapy for PTSD in military veterans. The use of virtual reality technology, combined with innovative components such as virtual pets and scent-enabled environments, provides a powerful tool for reducing symptoms of PTSD and improving quality of life. The results of our study have significant implications for the treatment of PTSD, and suggest that VR-enhanced therapy may be a valuable addition to traditional therapy approaches. The study’s findings also suggest that the use of VR-enhanced therapy may be particularly effective for military veterans who have experienced trauma in combat environments. The simulated combat environments used in the study were found to be highly realistic and immersive, allowing participants to confront and process their traumatic experiences in a safe and controlled environment. The use of virtual reality technology also allowed for a high level of customization, with participants able to tailor their therapy experience to their individual needs and preferences.

The use of innovative components, such as virtual pets and scent-enabled environments, provides a powerful tool for reducing symptoms of PTSD and improving quality of life. The study’s findings have significant implications for the treatment of PTSD, and suggest that VR-enhanced therapy may be a valuable addition to traditional therapy approaches. Further research is needed to fully explore the potential of VR-enhanced therapy for PTSD, but the results of our study provide a promising starting point for this important work. 6 Conclusion In retrospect, the integration of VR-enhanced therapy for PTSD in military veterans has yielded a plethora of fascinating outcomes, warranting a thorough examination of the complex interplay between technological innovation, psychological rehabilitation, and the human experience. As we delve into the nuances of this pioneering approach, it becomes increasingly evident that the synergistic convergence of immersive virtual reality environments, cutting-edge therapeutic modalities, and the resilient human spirit has the potential to revolutionize the treatment landscape for PTSD. By leveraging the unique capabilities of VR technology to simulate realistic, interactive, and emotionally 6 resonant experiences, therapists can now effectively transport patients into the epicenter of their trau- matic memories, thereby facilitating a more intimate and profound confrontation with the underlying psychological constructs that perpetuate their distress. Furthermore, the incorporation of auxiliary components, such as artificial intelligence-driven avatars, neurofeedback systems, and transcranial magnetic stimulation, may potentially augment the therapeutic efficacy of VR-enhanced interventions, enabling clinicians to tailor treatment protocols to the distinctive needs and circumstances of each individual veteran. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge the existence of certain unorthodox methods, including the utilization of virtual reality to simulate the experience of being a tree, which, although seemingly bizarre, may possess an inherent logic that warrants further exploration, as the act of embodying a stationary, yet resilient, organism may serve as a powerful metaphor for the process of healing and growth. Ultimately, the future of VR-enhanced therapy for PTSD in military veterans holds tremendous promise, as it embodies the confluence of human ingenuity, technological advancements, and the unwavering commitment to alleviating the suffering of those who have bravely served their nations, and it is through the continued pursuit of innovative, daring, and occasionally unorthodox approaches that we may unlock the full potential of this groundbreaking therapeutic paradigm. 7",0,,,,
P125.pdf,"DISCOSENSE: Commonsense Reasoning with Discourse Connectives Abstract We present DISCOSENSE, a benchmark for commonsense reasoning via un- derstanding a wide variety of discourse connectives. We generate compelling distractors in DISCOSENSE using Conditional Adversarial Filtering, an extension of Adversarial Filtering that employs conditional generation. We show that state of-the-art pre-trained language models struggle to perform well on DISCOSENSE, which makes this dataset ideal for evaluating next generation commonsense rea- soning systems. 1 Introduction This paper addresses the critical need for challenging benchmarks that can reliably target the limita- tions of current pre-trained language models (LMs) in commonsense reasoning. State-of-the-art LMs have achieved or even surpassed human performance on numerous commonsense downstream tasks. Nevertheless, these LMs are still very far from being able to perform commonsense reasoning as well as humans. Hence, the fact that they have begun to ace existing benchmarks implies that time is ripe to design a new challenging benchmark that can reliably target their limitations. Motivated by this observation, we present DISCOSENSE, a benchmark for performing commonsense reasoning through understanding a wide variety of discourse connectives. Figure 1 shows an example taken from DISCOSENSE. As can be seen, an example is composed of a context (e.g., “Our waitress was very nice, but she kept on forgetting my stuff.”) and a discourse connective (e.g., “For example”), and the goal is to choose the most plausible ending out of four options. If we ignore the discourse connective, then all four options may Our waitress was very nice, but she kept on forgetting my stuff. For example a) When I ordered the garlic shrimp, she remembered to add my requested garlic butter. b) She took forever to bring me my beer and fries. c) When I told her I wanted to use the free breakfast that was available she was not pleased. d) For some customers, this is fine. Figure 1: Example on commonsense reasoning with discourse connectives. The correct (i.e., most plausible) option is boldfaced. seem plausible because we do not know what the writer’s intent is. Once we consider both the context and the discourse connective, then it is clear that only option b) is plausible. The reason is that “For example” signals an EXEMPLIFICATION relation between its arguments, and what follows the discourse connective is expected to be an example of the waitress keeping on forgetting the writer’s stuff. Using commonsense knowledge, we know that (1) “my beer and fries” is an example of “my stuff”, and (2) her taking forever to bring the writer stuff implies she kept on forgetting his/her stuff. What if we replace “For example” with “However” in the example? Since “However” signals a CONTRAST relation, options a) and d) both seem viable. Specifically, option a) describes a situation in which she did not forget the writer’s stuff. While option d), unlike option a), does not describe any example that signals a contrast, one may infer a contrast between option d) and the context: being forgetful is fine for some customers. Nevertheless, option a) is arguably more plausible than option d) and should be chosen. The reason is that for d) to be sensible, one needs to assume that her forgetting the writer’s stuff implies that she is in general forgetful. Without this assumption, it may be strange for other customers to have an opinion on her forgetting the writer’s stuff. In general, the most plausible option is the option that makes the smallest number of assumptions, and/or is the most coherent given the context and the discourse connective. Considering the commonsense knowledge and the reasoning involved, it should not be difficult to see that this task is challenging. Our contributions are four-fold. First, we create DISCOSENSE, a new dataset aimed at testing LMs’ commonsense reasoning capabilities through discourse connectives. Second, we employ a controlled text generation based adversarial filtering approach to generate compelling negatives. Third, we establish baseline results on DISCOSENSE with numerous state-of-the-art discriminator models and show that they struggle to perform well on DISCOSENSE, which makes our dataset an ideal benchmark for next-generation commonsense reasoning systems. Finally, we show the efficacy of using DISCOSENSE as a transfer learning resource through sequential fine-tuning of LMs on DISCOSENSE followed by HELLASWAG and achieve near state-of-the-art results on the HELLASWAG test set. To stimulate work on this task, we make our code and data publicly available. 2 Related Work In this section, we discuss related work, focusing our discussion on the differences between DIS- COSENSE and existing commonsense reasoning benchmarks. In addition, we present an overview of Adversarial Filtering, which will facilitate the introduction of the Conditional Adversarial Filtering mechanism we propose in Section 3. Commonsense reasoning benchmarks. SWAG and HELLASWAG are arguably the most prominent commonsense reasoning benchmarks. In SWAG, given a partial description along with four candidate endings, the task is to predict the most plausible ending. The synthetic options (a.k.a. distractors) are generated through a process called Adversarial Filtering (AF) (see below). HELLASWAG is an extension of SWAG that seeks to eliminate artifacts in the generated endings. Unlike SWAG and HELLASWAG, DISCOSENSE requires that the discourse connective be taken into account in the reasoning process, thus increasing the number of inference steps and potentially the task complexity. In addition, while the examples in SWAG and HELLASWAG come primarily from ActivityNet (a benchmark focused on dense captioning of temporal events), DISCOSENSE features a more diverse set of examples coming from varied domains that may only be solved with rich background knowledge. There are benchmarks that aim to test different kinds of commonsense reasoning abilities, although none of them focuses on reasoning over discourse connectives. SocialIQA, for instance, focuses on social and emotional commonsense reasoning. ABDUCTIVE NLI focuses on abductive reasoning. WINOGRANDE contains Winograd schema-inspired problems, which are essentially hard pronoun resolution problems requiring world knowledge. PIQA examines physical commonsense reasoning. MCTACO and TIMEDIAL focus on temporal reasoning in comprehension and dialogue formats. More closely related to DISCOSENSE are commonsense reasoning benchmarks that involve reason- ing with a particular kind of relations. COPA (Choice of Plausible Alternatives) focuses exclusively on reasoning with CAUSAL relations and involves choosing the more plausible ending out of two (rather than four) options. P-MCQA focuses exclusively on reasoning with PRECONDITION rela- tions: given a commonsense fact, select the precondition that make the fact possible (enabling) or impossible (disabling) out of four options. NLI, which aims to evaluate defensible inference, focuses exclusively on reasoning with the STRENGTHEN/WEAKEN relations: given a premise-claim pair where the premise supports the claim, generate a sentence that either strengthens or weakens the support. WINOVENTI, which is composed of Winogradstyle schemas, focuses exclusively on reasoning with ENTAILMENT relations: given two sentences with an entailment relation, such as ”Pete says the pear is delicious. The pear is ”, the goal is to fill in the blank with one of two choices (e.g., ”edible”, ”inedible”). There are two key differences between these datasets and DISCOSENSE. First, rather than focusing on a particular type of relation, DISCOSENSE encompasses 37 discourse connectives signaling different discourse relation types. Second, DISCOSENSE involves reasoning 2 Dataset Model Human SWAG 91.71 88 NLI 91.18 92.9 Hellaswag 93.85 95.6 CosmosQA 91.79 94 PIQA 90.13 94.9 SocialIQa 83.15 88.1 MC-TACO 80.87 75.8 WinoGrande 86.64 94 ProtoQA 54.15 74.03 VCR 63.15 85 Table 1: Status of how competitive current common-sense reasoning benchmarks are for state-of-the- art pre-trained language models. Figure 1: Components of Adversarial Filtering. with discourse connectives, which is more complicated than reasoning with discourse relations. Specifically, as some connectives are sense-ambiguous (e.g., the connective “since” may serve as a temporal or causal connective), a LM will likely need to (implicitly) perform sense disambiguation in order to perform well on DISCOSENSE. There are datasets and knowledge bases where the semantic/discourse/commonsense relations are explicitly annotated and which can provide data sources from which commonsense reasoning bench- marks can be derived. Examples include (1) the Penn Discourse TreeBank, where two sentences or text segments are annotated with their discourse relation type, if any; (2) COREQUISITE, which is used to provide the commonsense facts and the human-generated preconditions in the P-MCQA dataset mentioned above; (3) SNLI, where each premise-hypothesis pair is annotated as ENTAIL- MENT, CONTRADICTION, or NEUTRAL; (4) ATOMIC20, which is a commonsense knowledge graph where the nodes correspond to propositions and the edges correspond to social/physical commonsense relations; and (5) SOCIAL-CHEM-101, which is a collection of statements about commonsense social judgments made given everyday situations. One of the motivations behind the creation of DISCOSENSE is that state-of-the-art LMs have man- aged to achieve or even surpass human performance on various commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Table 1 shows the best accuracies achieved by existing LMs on 10 widely used commonsense rea- soning benchmarks and the corresponding human performance levels. As can be seen, existing LMs have managed to achieve an accuracy of more than 80 Adversarial filtering (AF). Originally proposed by, AF aims to create examples that would be difficult for models to solve, specifically by replacing the easy options in correctlysolved examples with difficult ones. As shown in Figure 2, AF has three components: data (i.e., examples with multiple options, one of which is correct), a discriminator LM (a classifier that is used to solve each example) and a generator LM (a model that generates new options for an example). In each AF iteration, the discriminator LM is trained on the training set and used to solve each example in the test set. If a test example is incorrectly solved (i.e., the discriminator LM chooses the wrong option), the example is deemed sufficiently difficult and no change is made to it. On the other hand, if a test example is correctly solved, then AF seeks to increase its difficulty by replacing the easiest option (i.e., the generated option that the discriminator LM classifies with the highest confidence) with a new option generated by the generator LM. Training a new discriminator LM in each AF iteration ensures that the dataset is not just adversarial for one LM but a class of LMs, as training different instances of the same type of LMs results in models that have differently learned linguistic representations. This process is repeated on all correctly classified examples in the test set until the performance on the test set converges. 3 Data Source DISCOSENSE Train DISCOSENSE Test DISCOVERY Train Bottom 7% DISCOVERY Validation 100% DISCOFUSE train Top 54k w/ DC Table 2: Data sources for DISCOSENSE and its composition before human verification.

The correct endings can be obtained after understanding the purpose of the given discourse connectives. Given a context c <s, d>, which is composed of a contextual sentence s and a discourse connective d as well as a set of four options O = o1, o2, o3, o4, the task is to predict the most plausible ending oi belongs to O. 3.2 Dataset Creation To assemble DISCOSENSE, we focus on source datasets that contain two sentences connected through a discourse connective. Specifically, we use two peer reviewed academic datasets, DISCOVERY and DISCOFUSE. In DISCOVERY, each sentence is composed of two sentences connected via a discourse connective for the purpose of learning joint sentence representations with discourse connectives. DISCOFUSE, on the other hand, is assembled for the task of sentence fusion (i.e., joining several independent sentences into a single coherent sentence). We only consider those examples where a discourse connective is needed for sentence fusion, and include in DISCOSENSE the fused sentences in the Wikipedia split of DISCOFUSE. Since these datasets contain sentences from Common Crawl and Wikipedia articles, DISCOSENSE is diverse in the topics it covers. Importantly, since by construction the discourse connective is crucial in solving the underlying tasks (i.e., sentence representation learning and sentence fusion), the crucial role played by the discourse connectives in these sentences makes them suitable for our use case. Details of how the DISCOVERY and DISCOFUSE sentences are used to create DISCOSENSE are shown in Tables 2 and 3. 3.3 Generating Options Next, we describe how we generate challenging options for DISCOSENSE using an improved version of AF that we call Conditional Adversarial Filtering (CAF). CAF follows the AF procedure in Figure 2, only differing from AF in terms of (1) the generator LM (Section 3.3.1), (2) the discriminator LM (Section 3.3.2), and (3) how the generator LMs are used to generate options (Section 3.3.3). 3.3.1 Conditional Generator LM Pre-training does not explicitly teach how important a particular token or text span is in contributing to the semantics of a sentence. Hence, to be able to generate sentences that are coherent with not only the context but also the discourse connective, we propose to use Controllable Text Generation, which aims to provide a more granular control over how generation happens to match a particular attribute. In the context of Transformer-based LMs, there are two lines of research on controllable text generation. One examines how to steer generation by fine-tuning an extra set of parameters while keeping the base (unconditionally trained) model fixed while the other involves conditionally training a generative model on a control variable to generate text w.r.t. a prompt prefix. We adopt the latter 4 approach, extending CTRL to explicitly steer generation w.r.t. discourse relations by using discourse connectives as control codes, as described below. Training. The input to CTRL is as follows: input: <d> <contexts> label: <endings> where d is a discourse connective. Specifically, each input context for CTRL is prepended with a connective, and the training task for CTRL is to learn the conditional distribution p(e|d, context) over possible endings e. The predicted ending is then compared with the human generated ending to compute loss. Since the original CTRL model is pre-trained with control codes suitable for openended text generation, we fine-tune CTRL on the portion of DISCOVERY shown in Table 3 using all the 174 connectives present in the selected splits. Comparing Tables 2 and 3, we can see that the data the generator LM is fine-tuned on is not part of DISCOSENSE. Doing so ensures that the endings generated by the generator LM are different from the ground truth (i.e., the human written endings). Decoding. We use Nucleus sampling for generating options for the training set with the value of p set to 0.7, which means the weights of the tail of the probability distribution are ignored (i.e., tokens with a cumulative probability mass of less than 0.3 are left out). Additionally, we use a length penalty of 0.8 to restrict the length of the generations to match the average length of the ground truth to avoid the induction of length bias. Efficacy of conditional generation. Recall that we propose the use of conditional generation, specifi- cally the use of discourse connectives as control codes, in our generator LM because of our hypothesis that the resulting LM would generate options that are more compliant with the purpose of the dis- course connective. To test this hypothesis, we compare the text generation capability of CTRL with that of GPT2-XL, a model that is trained unconditionally and has nearly the same number of parameters (1.6B) as CTRL, under the same evaluation setting. Specifically, both LMs are fine-tuned on the same data (see Table 3) using the same machine (a 2x Quadro RTX 8000 with a batch size of 24). The only difference between them lies in the format of the training examples: in CTRL the discourse connective is used as the control code and therefore precedes the context, whereas in GPT2XL, the discourse connective follows the context. The two LMs are then independently applied to generate exactly one option for each example in the DISCOVERY validation set. CTRL achieves a much lower perplexity than GPT2-XL (2.39 vs. 2.53), which suggests that conditional training improves the quality of the generated sentences. 3.3.2 Discriminator LM We use ROBERTA-LARGE as the discriminator LM, which takes the context, the discourse connec- tive, and the four endings as input and predicts the most plausible ending. This LM is trained on the randomly shuffled training split of DISCOSENSE and applied to the DISCOSENSE test set to get the confidence scores associated with its predictions. 3.3.3 Generating Options Next, we describe how we generate options for the examples in DISCOSENSE. Recall that each example contains one of 174 discourse connectives. Rather than generating options for examples that contain any of these 174 connectives, we select 37 discourse connectives and generate options only for examples that contain one of them. The connectives that are discarded are primarily those that impose few constraints on the endings to be gen- erated given the context according to preliminary experiments. For instance, the connective “and” is discarded because numerous endings are equally plausible. Similarly for connectives that signal a temporal relation (e.g., “before”, “after”): they also tend to allow numerous equally plausible endings, as can be seen in examples such as “John went to eat lunch after [ending]”. The 37 connectives that we end up choosing are shown in Table 4. These connectives are less likely to yield options that look equally plausible to human annotators and which are indicative of different kinds of discourse relations, such as EXEMPLIFICATION (e.g., “for instance”), CONCESSION (e.g., “although”), COMPARISON (e.g., “in contrast”), and CAUSAL (e.g., “as a result”). 94k examples in DISCOSENSE contain one of the 37 connectives. 5 although in other words particularly because of this in sum specifically because of that interestingly subsequently but instead thereafter consequently likewise thereby conversely nevertheless therefore for example nonetheless though for instance on the contrary thus hence on the other hand yet however otherwise in contrast overall Table 4: Discourse connectives present in DISCOSENSE.

To generate the options for these 94k sentences, we begin by training 20 generator LMs on a randomly shuffled order of the generators’ training data (see Table 3) and then inserting them into a circular queue. Although the underlying data is the same, random shuffling ensures that the learned representations of these 20 models are different. Since each example needs to have 3 synthetic options, we use the first 3 generator LMs from the circular queue to generate the initial options for each example. After that, we begin CAF. In each CAF iteration, we (1) train the discriminator LM (see Section 3.3.2) on the DISCOSENSE training set for 4 epochs and use it to filter out the options deemed as easiest by the discriminator LM; and (2) use the next generator LM in the circular queue to generate the options for the examples whose easiest option is removed by the discriminator LM. In other words, a different discriminator LM is used in each CAF iteration, and a generator LM in the circular queue is used once every 20 CAF iterations. CAF is run separately for the DISCOSENSE training and test sets. After running CAF for approximately 150 iterations, the average accuracy of a discriminator LM decreased from 86–90 3.3.4 Other Implementation Details For the models we use in CAF, we obtain the pre-trained weights and the implementations from Hugging Face Transformers. These models are trained using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 2e-5. The training of each generator LM is performed on a 2x Quadro RTX 8000 with a batch size of 24 and typically lasts for 3 days. The training of a discriminator LM is performed on a RTX 3090 with a batch size of 16 and typically lasts for 5–6 hours. 3.4 Human Verification Next, we perform human verification of the examples for which we have generated options. The verification proceeds in two steps. In Step 1, we ask three human verifiers to independently identify the correct option for each example, removing an example if at least one person fails to identify the correct option. We repeat this process until the number of examples that survive this verification 6 Model Accuracy / std Random Guess 25.0 BERT-BASE (110M) 32.86 / 0.45 BERT-LARGE (336M) 34.25 / 1.04 ROBERTA-BASE (125M) 34.11 / 0.45 ROBERTA-LARGE (355M) 34 / 0.2 ALBERT-XXLARGE-V2 (223M) 50.91 / 1.44 LONGFORMER BASE (435M) 35.29 / 0.77 XLNET LARGE (340M) 36.71 / 0.77 FUNNEL-TRANSFORMER-XL (468M) 35.22 / 1.94 ELECTRA-LARGE 65.87 / 2.26 Human Performance 95.40 / 0.20 Table 6: Accuracies (best results obtained among 8 epochs when averaged over 5 runs with random seeds) of the LMs on the DISCOSENSE test set. reaches 13,056. In Step 2, we ask three human verifiers not involved in Step 1 to independently identify the correct option for each of the 13,056 examples verified in Step 1. We compute for each verifier the accuracy of choosing the correct option and use the average accuracy as the human performance on DISCOSENSE. Appendix A contains the details on how the human verifiers are recruited and the annotation instructions we present to them. 3.5 Dataset Statistics Statistics on DISCOSENSE are shown in Table 5, in which we report the average number of tokens in (1) the context, (2) the ground truth and (3) the generated endings. The number of unique tokens provides a rough characterization of the richness of the vocabulary. In addition, we report the distribution of the examples over the discourse connectives in DISCOSENSE in Figure 3. 4 Evaluation 4.1 Baseline Systems Our baselines are composed of prominent LMs with different kinds of Transformer architectures. First, we consider models that are pre-trained in a BERT-like fashion and share architectural similarities, including the base and large variants of BERT and ROBERTA, as well as ALBERT-XXLARGE-V2. As an extension, we select LONGFORMER BASE, which is pre-trained in the same manner as ROBERTA but has a sparse attention matrix. From the autoregressive/decoder based networks, we experiment with XLNET LARGE, which maximizes the learning of bidirectional contexts and GPT2-XL. For models trained with a different pre-training objective, we experiment with ELECTRA-LARGE and FUNNEL-TRANSFORMER-XL, the latter of which is pre-trained in a similar manner as ELECTRA- LARGE. We obtain the implementations of these LMs from Hugging Face Transformers. We fine-tune them on the DISCOSENSE training set using a 4way cross-entropy loss in the same way as the discriminator LMs in CAF are trained (see Section 3.3.4) and evaluate them on the test set. 4.2 Results and Discussion Results on the test set, which are expressed in terms of accuracy, are shown in Table 6. A few points deserve mention. First, all baselines perform better than random guess (row 1). This implies that while CAF is used to remove easy options, there may still be artifacts in the data that could be exploited by the LMs. Second, models sharing a similar pre-training objective as that of BERT, such as ROBERTA and LONGFORMER, are among the worst baselines. A similar trend is observed with XLNET. Although 7 ALBERT has the Masked Token Prediction task in its pre-training objective, its architectural differ- ences (i.e., larger hidden states and parameter sharing) and its Sentence Order Prediction objective seem to help it learn inter-sentence coherency properties better than its BERT counterparts. Third, pre-training appears to play a predominant role in our task. While the BERT family of models are trained with the masked-LM objective, the pre-training objective of ELECTRA (the best baseline) is designed to determine if a token in a human-written sentence has been replaced by a generator. We speculate that ELECTRA’s superior performance can be attributed to the fact that its pretrained knowledge of discriminating between syn- thetic and human generated tokens transfers well to the task of discriminating between synthetically generated sentences and human written sentences in DISCOSENSE. Nevertheless, the fact that it only achieves an accuracy of 65.87 Finally, we report human performance in the last row of Table 6. Details of how these numbers are obtained are discussed in Section 3.4. As can be seen, the accuracy achieved by the best baseline, ELECTRA, lags behind that of humans by nearly 30 4.3 Quantitative Error Analysis We perform a quantitative error analysis of our best-performing model, ELECTRA. Specifically, we compute for each discourse connective the percentage of examples in the DISCOSENSE test set that are misclassified by ELECTRA, with the goal of gaining a better understanding of the discourse connectives that are perceived as easy as well as those that are perceived as difficult as far as commonsense reasoning is concerned. Results are shown in Figure 4. As we can see, the misclassification rates are highest for those discourse connectives that express contrast (e.g., “otherwise”, “however”, “but”, “although”). A plausible explanation for this result is that it is often hard to anticipate what a human would have in mind if they are trying to indicate the opposite of what they mean to say. On the other hand, the model finds it easy to predict sentences where the discourse connective signals compliance and exemplification (e.g., “similarly”, “likewise”, “hence”, “because of that”, “for example”). 4.4 Qualitative Error Analysis To better understand the mistakes made by ELECTRA, we manually inspected 100 randomly selected examples that are misclassified and identified four major reasons why they are misclassified. Less plausible endings. This category contributes to 21 perentt of the errors where the model chooses a less plausible ending. Choosing a less plausible option could be associated with a partial understanding of the context or unwarranted assumptions. In Example 1 of Figure 5, the model makes the assumption that whatever is applicable to grass is also applicable to trees. However, the option it ends up picking is non-factual in nature because of the phrase “7000 years ago”. Abstract associations. 14 percent of the errors are made due to the formation of abstract associations between concepts. The model seems to rely on certain spans of context for classification rather than understand the semantics in its entirety. In Example 2 of Figure 5, the model seems to wrongly associate “energy dense nutrients” with “obesity” and fails to understand that the context is discussing the correlation between nutrient deficit diet and people belonging to lower income groups. Complex Context Understanding. 23 Although the grasses were only a moment old, they appeared as if they were months old. Likewise a) Similar phenomena occurred with the ancient trees around the earth 7,000 years ago. b) The dinosaurs were not billions of years old. c) Several seeds were found encased within stems that are several months old, but they seemed quite fresh and alive. d) The trees, although only a day old when they sprouted forth, were nevertheless like trees years old as they were fully grown. 8 Low income people are less likely to consume a healthy diet than wealthier people, and energy dense nutrients poor diets are preferentially consumed by persons of lower socioeconomic status. Consequently a) Nutrients associated with these diets may be potentially contributing to obesity and diabetes. b) Metabolic syndrome is primarily related to obesity. c) Their health is at greater risk from diet related illness. d) A great number of persons suffering from obesity related diseases receive inadequate nutritional care. It weighs on a mind, all this but a) You have to live it if you want to know whats on it. b) All that means in practice. c) It does make me want to back up and ask even bigger questions. d) In a kind of perverse way, I don’t really feel sad. Figure 5: Examples misclassified by ELECTRA (misclassified options in pink; ground truths in green). make a person do, in this case, “ask bigger questions”. Lack of understanding of the discourse connective. In many cases it is difficult to pinpoint the reason why an example is misclassified. Hence, if a misclassified example is not covered by any of the first three categories, we attribute the mistake to a lack of understanding of the discourse connective. This category contributes to 42 4.5 Role of Context and Discourse connective To better understand the role played by the context and the discourse connective in a LM’s reasoning process, we conduct two ablation experiments. In the first experiment, we remove the discourse connective, so only the context and the endings are available to the LMs. In the second experiment, we strip the context and the discourse connective, exposing only the endings to the LMs. Results of these experiments are shown in the C+E column and the E column of Table 7 respectively.

This novel technique offers a significant advantage in scenarios where obtaining multiple proxies is challenging or infeasible. The algorithm’s robustness to model misspecification and its ability to handle high-dimensional data are also key features. Furthermore, we demonstrate the algorithm’s effectiveness through extensive simulations and real-world applications, showcasing its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The theoretical underpinnings of the algorithm are rigorously established, providing a solid foundation for its application in various causal inference problems. Our findings contribute signif- icantly to the field of causal inference, offering a practical and powerful tool for researchers and practitioners alike. 1 Introduction The objective of this research is to develop an innovative algorithm for accurately estimating the causal effect of treatment on outcomes in linear Structural Causal Models (SCMs) when latent confounders are present. Existing methods often struggle in this scenario, typically requiring multiple proxy variables to account for the unobserved confounding or relying on strong, often unrealistic, assumptions about the data generating process. These limitations significantly restrict the applicability of these methods in real-world settings where obtaining multiple reliable proxies can be challenging or even impossible. Our proposed approach offers a significant advancement by leveraging a single proxy variable, combined with information extracted from cross-moments of the observed variables, to identify and estimate causal effects. This reduction in data requirements makes our method considerably more practical and widely applicable. The algorithm’s robustness to model misspecification and its ability to handle high-dimensional data are also key features, enhancing its utility in complex real-world scenarios. The core innovation lies in the strategic use of cross-moments to capture the intricate relationships between the observed variables and the latent confounder. By carefully analyzing these relationships, our algorithm effectively disentangles the direct effect of the treatment from the indirect effect mediated by the latent confounder. This allows for a more accurate estimation of the causal effect, even in the presence of significant confounding bias. The theoretical foundations of the algorithm are rigorously established, ensuring its reliability and providing a solid basis for its application. We demonstrate the algorithm’s effectiveness through extensive simulations, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art methods under various conditions, including varying levels of confounding and noise. These simulations highlight the algorithm’s superior accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we showcase the practical applicability of our algorithm through real-world case studies. These applications demonstrate the algorithm’s ability to provide valuable causal insights in settings . where traditional methods fail. The algorithm’s efficiency and scalability make it particularly suitable for large-scale datasets, a significant advantage in the era of big data. This capability addresses a critical limitation of many existing causal inference techniques, which often struggle with the computational demands of large datasets. The potential applications of this algorithm extend to diverse fields, including healthcare, economics, and social sciences, where understanding causal relationships is crucial for informed decision-making. Our work contributes significantly to the field of causal inference by providing a practical and powerful tool for researchers and practitioners. The algorithm’s ability to handle latent confounders with a single proxy variable represents a major breakthrough, simplifying the data requirements for causal inference and broadening its accessibility. This simplification is particularly valuable in situations where data collection is expensive or limited. The algorithm’s robustness and efficiency make it a promising candidate for widespread adoption in causal inference applications across various disciplines.

Traditional approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as the availability of multiple proxy variables [1, 2] or the imposition of restrictive functional forms on the relationships between variables [3]. These assumptions can be difficult to justify in practice, limiting the applicability of these methods. For instance, methods based on instrumental variables [4] require the identification of a variable that affects the treatment but not the outcome directly, a condition that is often hard to satisfy. Similarly, techniques relying on conditional independence assumptions [5] may be sensitive to violations of these assumptions, leading to biased estimates. Our approach offers a significant advantage by relaxing these stringent requirements. Several recent works have explored the use of proxy variables for handling latent confounding [6, 7]. However, these methods often require multiple proxies, which can be challenging to obtain in many real-world applications. Furthermore, the performance of these methods can be sensitive to the quality and number of proxies used. In contrast, our method leverages a single proxy variable, making it more practical and robust to the limitations of proxy data. The use of cross-moments to extract additional information from the observed data is a key innovation that distinguishes our approach from existing methods. The use of cross-moments in causal inference has been explored in various contexts [8, 9]. However, these methods often focus on specific model structures or make strong assumptions about the data generating process. Our approach provides a more general framework that can handle a wider range of scenarios. The theoretical guarantees we provide offer a solid foundation for the reliability and validity of our method, addressing a critical gap in the existing literature. This rigorous theoretical analysis distinguishes our work from purely empirical approaches. Our algorithm also addresses the challenge of high-dimensional data, a common issue in modern causal inference problems. Many existing methods struggle with the computational complexity associated with high-dimensional data, limiting their applicability to large-scale datasets. Our method’s efficiency and scalability make it particularly well-suited for such scenarios. This scalability is achieved through the efficient use of cross-moments and the development of computationally efficient algorithms. This aspect of our work contributes to the growing need for scalable causal inference techniques. 2 Finally, our work contributes to the broader goal of developing more robust and reliable causal inference methods. The ability to accurately estimate causal effects in the presence of latent con- founders is crucial for many applications, ranging from healthcare to social sciences. Our method’s ability to handle latent confounders with a single proxy variable, coupled with its robustness and scalability, represents a significant advancement in the field. The development of user-friendly software implementing this algorithm will further enhance its accessibility and impact. 3 Methodology Our proposed method leverages a single proxy variable and cross-moments to identify and estimate causal effects in linear Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with latent confounders. Unlike existing methods that often require multiple proxy variables or strong assumptions, our approach offers a more practical and robust solution. The core idea is to exploit the information contained in the cross-moments of the observed variables to disentangle the direct effect of the treatment from the indirect effect mediated by the latent confounder. This is achieved by carefully analyzing the relationships between the observed variables and the single proxy variable, allowing us to effectively account for the unobserved confounding. The algorithm is designed to be robust to model misspecification and capable of handling high-dimensional data, making it suitable for a wide range of real-world applications. The algorithm’s efficiency stems from its ability to directly utilize cross-moments, avoiding computationally expensive iterative procedures often found in other methods. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when dealing with large datasets. Furthermore, the algorithm’s theoretical foundations are rigorously established, providing strong guarantees on its performance and reliability. The theoretical analysis ensures that the estimated causal effects are consistent and asymptotically normal under mild conditions. This rigorous theoretical framework distinguishes our approach from purely empirical methods. The algorithm’s robustness is further enhanced by its ability to handle noisy data and model misspecification, ensuring reliable results even in challenging scenarios. The algorithm’s design incorporates techniques to mitigate the impact of noise and model misspecification, leading to more accurate and stable estimates. The algorithm’s modular design allows for easy extension and adaptation to different settings. The algorithm proceeds in three main steps. First, we estimate the cross-moments of the observed variables, including the treatment, outcome, and proxy variable. These cross-moments capture the complex relationships between the variables and provide crucial information for identifying the causal effect. The estimation of these cross-moments is performed using robust statistical techniques that are resistant to outliers and noise. The choice of estimation method is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and robustness of the subsequent steps. We employ a method that is both efficient and robust to outliers and noise, ensuring reliable estimates even in the presence of noisy data. The second step involves solving a system of equations derived from the estimated cross-moments. This system of equations is carefully constructed to leverage the information contained in the cross-moments to identify the causal effect. The solution to this system of equations provides an estimate of the causal effect, accounting for the latent confounder. The solution is obtained using efficient numerical methods that are designed to handle potential numerical instabilities. The third step involves constructing confidence intervals for the estimated causal effect. This step provides a measure of uncertainty associated with the estimate, allowing for a more complete understanding of the results. The confidence intervals are constructed using asymptotic theory, providing valid inferences even in large samples. The entire process is designed to be computationally efficient, allowing for the analysis of large datasets. The theoretical properties of the algorithm are rigorously established, ensuring its reliability and validity. We prove that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal under mild conditions. These theoretical guarantees provide a strong foundation for the application of the algorithm in various settings. The consistency result ensures that the estimator converges to the true causal effect as the sample size increases. The asymptotic normality result allows for the construction of valid confidence intervals, providing a measure of uncertainty associated with the estimate. The theoretical analysis also provides insights into the algorithm’s robustness to model misspecification and the impact of noise.

P127.pdf,"Examining Machine Learning’s Impact on Personal Privacy Abstract This paper delves into the growing concerns surrounding the use of machine learning and its impact on personal privacy. It highlights the potential for misuse in surveillance technologies and proposes various strategies to counter these threats, emphasizing the need for collaboration between machine learning experts and human-computer interaction (HCI) researchers. 1 Introduction The intersection of machine learning and privacy has become a significant area of study within the field of computer science. While privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy offer potential solutions, some machine learning systems, particularly those designed for biometric analysis or behavioral profiling, inherently compromise individual privacy. Therefore, there is a crucial need to explore methods beyond these traditional approaches. Although various definitions and frameworks for privacy have been proposed, a universal consensus remains elusive. This paper focuses on specific harms to privacy caused or made worse by machine learning systems. In an era of powerful algorithms and massive datasets, maintaining privacy is increasingly challenging, given that facial recognition systems can identify individuals in public spaces, targeted advertising can exploit user profiles, and predictive policing algorithms can single out individuals for surveillance. This paper addresses these unique threats to privacy that machine learning systems enable. This research provides an overview of strategies developed to combat privacy-threatening machine learning systems and advocates for increased collaboration between the machine learning community and experts in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). Two main approaches are discussed: first, challenging the data that feeds these models through obfuscation or data withholding, and second, directly challenging the model itself through public pressure or regulation. This paper suggests that computer scientists have an important role to play in both these approaches. 2 Challenging Data Machine learning systems depend on data for both training and operation. Data is used to train machine learning models, and new data is fed into the models to generate predictions. These training and deployment stages can be iterative; models can be updated using new data over time. One way to oppose a machine learning system is by disrupting the data it relies on. This involves strategies such as data obfuscation or withholding of data. 2.1 Obfuscation One method for avoiding machine learning surveillance is by altering either the data used to make predictions or the data used to train the system. For example, research has shown that glasses can be designed to deceive facial recognition systems. This type of method uses adversarial examples, where a slight modification to a data point is enough to cause misclassification by a machine learning . model but is imperceptible to humans. Various strategies have been developed for evading facial recognition using adversarial examples, with the aim to help individuals avoid surveillance. However, these approaches often lack strong guarantees. Another approach involves altering the training data used for machine learning models, known as data poisoning attacks. For example, systems can create altered images to reduce the accuracy of deep learning models. Additionally, some vendors sell clothing designed to trigger automated license plate readers by injecting junk data, furthering this method. Beyond image classification, similar obfuscation tactics have also been used to counter web tracking and loyalty card-based tracking. Obfuscation can also have an expressive function, as illustrated by groups who use unusual makeup to challenge facial recognition. These acts serve a dual purpose of both evading surveillance and protesting against its use. While adversarial examples and data poisoning are ongoing topics of study, these technologies need further evaluation before being adopted as anti-surveillance tools. Accessibility, evaluation methods, and communication of risks are areas that require further work and collaboration between machine learning experts, HCI researchers, activists, and other relevant stakeholders. 2.2 Withholding Data An alternative approach to altering data is to withhold it entirely. This can be achieved through privacy-enhancing technologies that block web tracking. While tracker-blocking browser extensions can provide some privacy to individuals, data can also be withheld collectively. Data strikes, a form of digital boycott, can apply pressure to technology companies. Protest non-use is another way of withholding data, where people stop using platforms due to privacy concerns. These methods go beyond simple evasion, using the act of withholding data as a way to launch broader campaigns against surveillance systems. 3 Challenging Models While data-oriented approaches are helpful, policy solutions may offer a more effective way to resist machine learning surveillance systems. For example, while strategies can help evade facial recognition, banning the technology would render those strategies unnecessary. There are many forms that regulation can take and many roles that computer scientists can play in this process. One method of pressuring companies that develop surveillance technologies is through auditing. Research audits of facial recognition systems have shown they perform poorly on darker-skinned subjects, which has led to wrongful arrests. These audits have led some companies to stop selling facial recognition technology. However, audits do have limitations, as they can sometimes normalize harmful tasks for certain communities. Some technologies are difficult to audit due to restricted access. Nevertheless, these systems can sometimes be reverse-engineered to show potential societal harms. Predictive policing systems, for instance, can amplify existing biases. Algorithmic audits or reverse engineering should focus on broader societal implications of the technology to avoid merely shifting goal posts and algorithmic reformism. Researchers have partnered with community organizations to resist surveillance technologies, debunk- ing the myth that critics do not understand the technology, and demystifying complex algorithms. It is important for researchers to approach these collaborations with humility, as community organizers bring their own areas of expertise. It is also crucial to recognize the academic community’s role in creating and upholding surveillance technologies. Computer science educators should make computing’s role in injustice more visible. Student-led efforts can help educate future computer scientists about the consequences of their work. 4 Conclusion This paper has outlined various methods for resisting machine learning-based surveillance technolo- gies. It emphasizes the need for participatory methods when developing anti-surveillance technologies. 2 While these participatory methods are common in HCI research, the machine learning community has paid less attention to it. The impact of surveillance technologies is disproportionately borne by already marginalized groups. Therefore, it is critical that the design of anti-surveillance technologies be led by those who are most affected. 3",1,,,,
P128.pdf,"End-to-End Neural Discourse Deixis Resolution in Dialogue Abstract We adapt a span-based entity coreference model to the task of end-to-end discourse deixis resolution in dialogue, specifically by proposing extensions to their model that exploit task-specific characteristics. The resulting model, dd-utt, achieves state-of-the-art results on the four datasets. 1 Introduction Discourse deixis (DD) resolution, also known as abstract anaphora resolution, is an under-investigated task that involves resolving a deictic anaphor to its antecedent. A deixis is a reference to a discourse entity such as a proposition, a description, an event, or a speech act. DD resolution is arguably more challenging than the extensively-investigated entity coreference resolution task. Recall that in entity coreference, the goal is to cluster the entity mentions in narrative text or dialogue, which are composed of pronouns, names, and nominals, so that the mentions in each cluster refer to the same real-world entity. Lexical overlap is a strong indicator of entity coreference, both among names (e.g., “President Biden”, “Joe Biden”) and in the resolution of nominals (e.g., linking “the president” to “President Biden”). DD resolution, on the other hand, can be viewed as a generalized case of event coreference involving the clustering of deictic anaphors, which can be pronouns or nominals, and clauses, such that the mentions in each cluster refer to the same real-world proposition/event/speech act, etc. An example of DD resolution in which the deictic anaphor “the move” refers to Salomon’s act of issuing warrants on shares described in the preceding sentence. DD resolution is potentially more challenging than entity coreference resolution because (1) DD resolution involves understanding clause semantics, which are arguably harder to encode than noun phrase semantics; and (2) string matching plays little role in DD resolution, unlike in entity coreference. We focus on end-to-end DD resolution in dialogue. While the deictic anaphors in dialogue are also composed of pronouns and nominals, the proportion of pronominal deictic anaphors in dialogue is much higher than that in narrative text. For instance, the percentage of pronominal deictic anaphors rises to 93 Since DD resolution can be cast as a generalized case of event coreference, a natural question is: how successful would a state-of-the-art entity coreference model be when applied to DD resolution? Recently, a re-implementation of a span-based entity coreference model has been applied to resolve the deictic anaphors in the DD track after augmenting it with a type prediction model. Not only did they achieve the highest score on each dataset, but they beat the second-best system, which is a non-span-based neural approach combined with hand-crafted rules, by a large margin. These results suggest that a span-based approach to DD resolution holds promise. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we investigate whether task-specific observations can be exploited to extend a span-based model originally developed for entity coreference to improve its performance for end-to-end DD resolution in dialogue. Second, our extensions are effective in improving model performance, allowing our model to achieve state-of-the-art results. Finally, we present an empirical analysis of our model, which, to our knowledge, is the first analysis of a state-of-the-art span-based DD resolver. Table 1: Statistics on the datasets.

Early systems that resolve deictic expressions are rule-based. Specifically, they use predefined rules to extract anaphoric mentions, and select antecedent for each extracted anaphor based on the dialogue act types of each candidate antecedent. • Non-neural learning-based approaches. Early non-neural learning-based approaches to DD resolution use hand-crafted feature vectors to represent mentions. A classifier is then trained to determine whether a pair of mentions is a valid antecedent-anaphor pair. • Deep learning-based approaches. Deep learning has been applied to DD resolution. For instance, a Siamese neural network is used, which takes as input the embeddings of two sentences, one containing a deictic anaphor and the other a candidate antecedent, to score each candidate antecedent and subsequently rank the candidate antecedents based on these scores. In addition, motivated by the recent successes of Transformer-based approaches to entity coreference, a Transformer-based approach to DD resolution has recently been proposed, which is an end-to-end coreference system based on SpanBERT. Their model jointly learns mention extraction and DD resolution and has achieved state-of-the-art results. 3 Corpora We use the DD-annotated corpora provided as part of the shared task. For training, we use the official training corpus from the shared task, ARRAU, which consists of three conversational sub- corpora (TRAINS-93, TRAINS-91, PEAR) and two non-dialogue sub-corpora (GNOME, RST). For validation and evaluation, we use the official development sets and test sets from the shared task. The shared task corpus is composed of four well-known conversational datasets: AMI, LIGHT, Persuasion, and Switchboard. Statistics on these corpora are provided in Table 1. 4 Baseline Systems We employ three baseline systems. The first baseline, coref-hoi, is a re-implementation of a widely-used end-to-end entity coreference model. The model ranks all text spans of up to a predefined length based on how likely they correspond to entity mentions. For each top-ranked span z, the model learns a distribution P(y) over its antecedents y ∈Y(z), where Y(z) includes a dummy antecedent ϵ and every preceding span: P(y) = es(z,y) P y′∈Y(z) es(z,y′) (1) where s(x, y) is a pairwise score that incorporates two types of scores: (1) sm(·), which indicates how likely a span is a mention, and (2) sc(·) and sa(·), which indicate how likely two spans refer to 2 the same entity (sc(z, ϵ) = sa(z, ϵ) = 0 for dummy antecedents): s(z, y) = sm(x) + sm(y) + sc(z, y) + sa(z, y) (2) sm(·) = FFNNm(gz) (3) sc(z, y) = gT x Wcgy (4) sa(z, y) = FFNNa([gx, gy, gx ⊙gy, ϕ(x, y)]) (5) where gx and gy are the vector representations of x and y, Wc is a learned weight matrix for bilinear scoring, FFNN(·) is a feedforward neural network, and ϕ(·) encodes features. Two features are used, one encoding speaker information and the other the segment distance between two spans. The second baseline, UTD_NLP, is the top-performing system in the DD track of the shared task. It extends coref-hoi with a set of modifications. Two of the most important modifications are: (1) the addition of a sentence distance feature to ϕ(·), and (2) the incorporation into coref-hoi a type prediction model, which predicts the type of a span. The possible types of a span i are: ANTECEDENT (if i corresponds to an antecedent), ANAPHOR (if i corresponds to an anaphor), and NULL (if it is neither an antecedent nor an anaphor). The types predicted by the model are then used by coref-hoi as follows: only spans predicted as ANAPHOR can be resolved, and they can only be resolved to spans predicted as ANTECEDENT. The third baseline, coref-hoi-utt, is essentially the first baseline except that we restrict the candidate antecedents to be utterances. This restriction is motivated by the observation that the antecedents of the deictic anaphors in the datasets are all utterances. 5 Model Next, we describe our resolver, dd-utt, which augments coref-hoi-utt with 10 extensions. E1. Modeling recency. Unlike in entity coreference, where two coreferent names (e.g., “Joe Biden”, “President Biden”) can be far apart from each other in the corresponding document (because names are non-anaphoric), the distance between a deictic anaphor and its antecedent is comparatively smaller. To model recency, we restrict the set of candidate antecedents of an anaphor to be the utterance containing the anaphor as well as the preceding 10 utterances, the choice of which is based on our observation of the development data, where the 10 closest utterances already cover 96–99% of the antecedent-anaphor pairs. E2. Modeling distance. While the previous extension allows us to restrict our attention to candidate antecedents that are close to the anaphor, it does not model the fact that the likelihood of being the correct antecedent tends to increase as its distance from the anaphor decreases. To model this relationship, we subtract the term γ1Dist(x, y) from s(x, y) (see Equation (1)), where Dist(x, y) is the utterance distance between anaphor x and candidate antecedent y and γ1 is a tunable parameter that controls the importance of utterance distance in the resolution process. Since s(x, y) is used to rank candidate antecedents, modeling utterance distance by updating s(x, y) will allow distance to have a direct impact on DD resolution. E3. Modeling candidate antecedent length. Some utterances are pragmatic in nature and do not convey any important information. Therefore, they cannot serve as antecedents of deictic anaphors. Examples include “Umm”, “Ahhhh... okay”, “that’s right”, and “I agree”. Ideally, the model can identify such utterances and prevent them from being selected as antecedents. We hypothesize that we could help the model by modeling such utterances. To do so, we observe that such utterances tend to be short and model them by penalizing shorter utterances. Specifically, we subtract the term γ2 1 Length(y) from s(x, y), where Length(y) is the number of words in candidate antecedent y and γ2 is a tunable parameter that controls the importance of candidate antecedent length in resolution. E4. Extracting candidate anaphors. As mentioned before, the deictic anaphors in dialogue are largely composed of pronouns. Specifically, in our development sets, the three pronouns “that”, “this”, and ‘it’ alone account for 74–88% of the anaphors. Consequently, we extract candidate deictic anaphors as follows: instead of allowing each span of length n or less to be a candidate anaphor, we only allow a span to be a candidate anaphor if its underlying word/phrase has appeared at least once in the training set as a deictic anaphor. 3 E5. Predicting anaphors. Now that we have the candidate anaphors, our next extension involves predicting which of them are indeed deictic anaphors. To do so, we retrain the type prediction model in UTD_NLP, which is a FFNN that takes as input the (contextualized) span representation gi of candidate anaphor i and outputs a vector oti of dimension 2 in which the first element denotes the likelihood that i is a deictic anaphor and the second element denotes the likelihood that i is not a deictic anaphor. i is predicted as a deictic anaphor if and only if the value of the first element of oti is bigger than its second value: oti = FFNN(gi) (6) ti = arg max x∈{A,NA} oti(x) (7) where A (ANAPHOR) and NA (NON-ANAPHOR) are the two possible types. Following UTD_NLP, this type prediction model is jointly trained with the resolution model. Specifically, we compute the cross-entropy loss using oti, multiply it by a type loss coefficient λ, and add it to the loss function of coref-hoi-utt. λ is a tunable parameter that controls the importance of type prediction relative to DD resolution. E6. Modeling the relationship between anaphor recognition and resolution. In principle, the model should resolve a candidate anaphor to a non-dummy candidate antecedent if it is predicted to be a deictic anaphor by the type prediction model. However, type prediction is not perfect, and enforcing this consistency constraint, which we will refer to as C1, will allow errors in type prediction to be propagated to DD resolution. For example, if a non-deictic anaphor is misclassified by the type prediction model, then it will be (incorrectly) resolved to a non-dummy antecedent. To alleviate error propagation, we instead enforce C1 in a soft manner. To do so, we define a penalty function p1, which imposes a penalty on span i if C1 is violated (i.e., a deictic anaphor is resolved to the dummy antecedent), as shown below: p1(i) = 0 if arg maxy∈Y s(i, y) = ϵ and ti = NA oti(A) −oti(NA) otherwise (8) Intuitively, p1 estimates the minimum amount to be adjusted so that span i’s type is not ANAPHOR. We incorporate pi into the model as a penalty term in s (Equation (1)). Specifically, we redefine s(i, ϵ) as shown below: s(i, ϵ) = s(i, ϵ) −[γ3p1(i)] (9) where γ3 is a positive constant that controls the hardness of C1. The smaller γ3 is, the softer C1 is. Intuitively, if C1 is violated, s(i, ϵ) will be lowered by the penalty term, and the dummy antecedent will less likely be selected as the antecedent of i. E7. Modeling the relationship between non-anaphor recognition and resolution. Another consistency constraint that should be enforced is that the model should resolve a candidate anaphor to the dummy antecedent if it is predicted as a non-deictic anaphor by the type prediction model. As in Extension E6, we will enforce this constraint, which we will refer to as C2, in a soft manner by defining a penalty function p2, as shown below: p2(i) = oti(NA) −oti(A) if arg maxy∈Y s(i, y) ̸= ϵ and ti = NA 0 otherwise (10) Then we redefine s(i, j) when j ̸= ϵ as follows: s(i, j) = s(i, j) −[γ4p2(i)] (11) where γ4 is a positive constant that controls the hardness of C2. Intuitively, if C2 is violated, s(i, j) will be lowered by the penalty term, and j will less likely be selected as the antecedent of i. E8. Encoding candidate anaphor context. Examining Equation (1), we see that s(x, y) is computed based on the span representations of x and y. While these span representations are contextualized, the contextual information they encode is arguably limited. As noted before, most of the deictic anaphors in dialogue are pronouns, which are semantically empty. As a result, we hypothesize that we could improve the resolution of these deictic anaphors if we explicitly modeled their contexts. Specifically, we represent the context of a candidate anaphor using the embedding of the utterance in which it appears and add the resulting embedding as features to both the bilinear score sc(x, y) and the concatenation-based score sa(x, y): sc(x, y) = gT x Wcgy + gT s Wagy (12) sa(x, y) = FFNNa([gx, gy, gx ⊙gy, gs, ϕ(x, y)]) (13) 4 Table 2: Lists of filtered words.

E9. Encoding the relationship between candidate anaphors and antecedents. As noted in Extension E8, ϕ(x, y) encodes the relationship between candidate anaphor x and candidate antecedent y. In UTD_NLP, ϕ(x, y) is composed of three features, including two features from coref-hoi-utt (i.e., the speaker id and the segment distance between x and y) and one feature that encodes the utterance distance between them. Similar to the previous extension, we hypothesize that we could better encode the relationship between x and y using additional features. Specifically, we incorporate an additional feature into ϕ(x, y) that encodes the utterance distance between x and y. Unlike the one used in UTD_NLP, this feature aims to more accurately capture proximity by ignoring unimportant sentences (i.e., those that contain only interjections, filling words, reporting verbs, and punctuation) when computing utterance distance. The complete list of filling words and reporting verbs that we filter can be found in Table 2. E10. Encoding candidate antecedents. In coref-hoi-utt, a candidate antecedent is simply encoded using its span representation. We hypothesize that we could better encode a candidate antecedent using additional features. Specifically, we employ seven features to encode a candidate antecedent y and incorporate them into ϕ(x, y): (1) the number of words in y; (2) the number of nouns in y; (3) the number of verbs in y; (4) the number of adjectives in y; (5) the number of content word overlaps between y and the portion of the utterance containing the anaphor that precedes the anaphor; (6) whether y is the longest among the candidate antecedents; and (7) whether y has the largest number of content word overlap (as computed in Feature #5) among the candidate antecedents. Like Extension E3, some features implicitly encode the length of a candidate antecedent. Despite this redundancy, we believe the redundant information could be exploited by the model differently and may therefore have varying degrees of impact on it. 6 Evaluation 6.1 Experimental Setup Evaluation metrics. We obtain the results of DD resolution using the Universal Anaphora Scorer. Since DD resolution is viewed as a generalized case of event coreference, the scorer reports perfor- mance in terms of CoNLL score, which is the unweighted average of the F-scores of three coreference scoring metrics, namely MUC, B3, and CEAFe. In addition, we report the results of deictic anaphor recognition. We express recognition results in terms of Precision (P), Recall (R) and F-score, con- 5 Table 3: Resolution and recognition results on the four test sets. Resolution Recognition LIGHT AMI Pers.

Model training and parameter tuning. For coref-hoi and coref-hoi-utt, we use SpanBERTLarge as the encoder and reuse the hyperparameters with the only exception of the maximum span width: for coref-hoi, we increase the maximum span width from 30 to 45 in order to cover more than 97% of the antecedent spans; coref-hoi-utt we use 15 as the maximum span width, which covers more than 99% of the anaphor spans in the training sets. For UTD_NLP, we simply take the outputs produced by the model on the test sets and report the results obtained by running the scorer on the outputs. For dd-utt, we use SpanBERTLarge as the encoder. Since we do not rely on span enumerate to generate candidate spans, the maximum span width can be set to any arbitrary number that is large enough to cover all candidate antecedents and anaphors. In our case, we use 300 as our maximum span width. We tune the parameters (i.e., λ, γ1, γ2, γ3, γ4) using grid search to maximize CoNLL score on development data. For the type loss coefficient, we search out of {0.2, 0.5, 1, 200, 500, 800, 1200, 1600}, and for γ, we search out of {1, 5, 10}. All models are trained for 30 epochs with a dropout rate of 0.3 and early stopping. We use 1 × 10−5 as our BERT learning rate and 3 × 10−4 as our task learning rate. Each experiment is run using a random seed of 11 and takes less than three hours to train on an NVIDIA RTX A6000 48GB. Train-dev partition. Since we have four test sets, we use ARRAU and all dev sets other than the one to be evaluated on for model training and the remaining dev set for parameter tuning. For example, when evaluating on AMItest, we train models on ARRAU, LIGHTdev, Persuasiondev and Switchboarddev and use AMIdev for tuning. 6.2 Results Recall that our goal is to perform end-to-end DD resolution, which corresponds to the Predicted evaluation setting in the shared task. Overall performance. Recognition results (expressed in F-score) and resolution results (expressed in CoNLL score) of the three baselines and our model on the four test sets are shown in Table 3, where the Avg. columns report the macro-averages of the corresponding results on the four test sets, and the parameter settings that enable our model to achieve the highest CoNLL scores on the development sets are shown in Table 4. Since coref-hoi and coref-hoi-utt do not explicitly identify deictic anaphors, we assume that all but the first mentions in each output cluster are anaphors when computing recognition precision; and while UTD_NLP (the top-performing system in the shared task) does recognize anaphors, we still make the same assumption when computing its recognition precision since the anaphors are not explicitly marked in the output (recall that we computed results of UTD_NLP based on its outputs). 6 We test the statistical significance among the four models using two-tailed Approximate Random- ization. For recognition, the models are statistically indistinguishable from each other w.r.t. their Avg. score (p < 0.05). For resolution, dd-utt is highly significantly better than the baselines w.r.t. Avg. (p < 0.001), while the three baselines are statistically indistinguishable from each other. These results suggest that (1) dd-utt’s superior resolution performance stems from better antecedent selec- tion, not better anaphor recognition; and (2) the restriction of candidate antecedents to utterances in coref-hoi-utt does not enable the resolver to yield significantly better resolution results than coref-hoi. Per-anaphor results. Next, we show the recognition and resolution results of the four models on the most frequently occurring deictic anaphors in Table 5 after micro-averaging them over the four test sets. Not surprisingly, “that” is the most frequent deictic anaphor on the test sets, appearing as an anaphor 402 times on the test sets and contributing to 68.8% of the anaphors. This is followed by “it” (16.3%) and “this” (4.3%). Only 8.9% of the anaphors are not among the top four anaphors. Consider first the recognition results. As can be seen, “that” has the highest recognition F-score among the top anaphors. This is perhaps not surprising given the comparatively larger number of “that” examples the models are trained on. While “it” occurs more frequently than “this” as a deictic anaphor, its recognition performance is lower than that of “this”. This is not surprising either: “this”, when used as a pronoun, is more likely to be deictic than “it”, although both of them can serve as a coreference anaphor and a bridging anaphor. In other words, it is comparatively more difficult to determine whether a particular occurrence of “it” is deictic. Overall, UTD_NLP recognizes more anaphors than the other models. Next, consider the resolution results. To obtain the CoNLL scores for a given anaphor, we retain all and only those clusters containing the anaphor in both the gold partition and the system partition and apply the official scorer to them. Generally, the more frequently occurring an anaphor is, the better its resolution performance is. Interestingly, for the “Others” category, dd-utt achieves the highest resolution results despite having the lowest recognition performance. In contrast, while UTD_NLP achieves the best recognition performance on average, its resolution results are among the worst. Results of the four resolvers (UTD_NLP, coref-hoi, coref-hoi-utt, and dd-utt) on the CODI-CRAC 2021 shared task test sets in terms of MUC, B3, and CEAFe scores are reported in Table. Their mention extraction results in terms of recall (R), precision (P), and F-score (F) are provided in Table. dd-utt achieves the best CoNLL scores on all four datasets, via achieving the best MUC, B3, and CEAFe F-scores. In terms of MUC F-score, the performance difference between dd-utt and the second best resolver on each dataset is substantial (2.2%-14.9% points). These results suggest that better link identification, which is what the MUC F- score reveals, is the primary reason for the superior performance of dd-utt. Moreover, Persuasion appears to be the easiest of the four datasets, as this is the dataset on which three of the four resolvers achieved the highest CoNLL scores. Note that Persuasion is also the dataset on which the differences in CoNLL score between dd-utt and the other resolvers are the smallest. These results seem to suggest that the performance gap between dd-utt and the other resolvers tends to widen as the difficulty of a dataset increases. In terms of anaphor extraction results in Table, dd-utt lags behind UTD_NLP on two datasets, AMI and Switchboard, in terms of F-score. Nevertheless, the anaphor extraction precision achieved by dd-utt is often one of the highest in each dataset. 7 Further Analysis An example is analyzed. In this example, dd-utt successfully extracts the anaphor ""that"" and resolves it to the correct antecedent, ""Losing one decimal place, that is okay"". UTD_NLP fails to extract ""that"" as a deictic anaphor. While coref-hoi correctly extracts the anaphor, it incorrectly selects ""You want your rating to be a two?"" as the antecedent. From a cursory look at this example, one could infer that this candidate antecedent is highly unlikely to be the correct antecedent since it is 10 utterances away from the anaphor. As for coref-hoi-utt, the resolver successfully extracts the anaphor but incorrectly selects ""Its just two point five for that one"" as the antecedent, which, like the antecedent chosen by coref-hoi, is farther away from the anaphor than the correct antecedent. Coref-hoi and coref-hoi-utt fail to identify the correct antecedent because they do not explicitly model distance and therefore may not have an idea about how far a candidate antecedent is from the anaphor under consideration.

A: Losing one decimal place, that is okay. 8 Error Analysis DD anaphora recognition precision errors. A common type of recognition precision errors involves misclassifying a coreference anaphor as a deictic anaphor. Consider the first example in Figure 2, in which the pronoun ""that"" is a coreference anaphor with ""voice recognition"" as its antecedent but is misclassified as a deictic anaphor with the whole sentence as its antecedent. This type of error occurs because virtually all of the frequently occurring deictic anaphors, including ""that"", ""it"", ""this"", and ""which"", appear as a coreference anaphor in some contexts and as a deictic anaphor in other contexts, and distinguishing between the two different uses of these anaphors could be challenging. DD anaphor recognition recall errors. Consider the second example in Figure 2, in which ""it"" is a deictic anaphor that refers to the boldfaced utterance, but dd-utt fails to identify this and many other occurrences of ""it"" as deictic, probably because ""it"" is more likely to be a coreference anaphor than a deictic anaphor: in the dev sets, 80% of the occurrences of ""it"" are coreference anaphors while only 5% are deictic anaphors. DD resolution precision errors. A major source of DD resolution precision errors can be attributed 8 Table 6: Mention extraction results on the test sets.

While dd-utt correctly identifies ""that"" as a deictic anaphor, it erroneously posits the italicized utterance as its antecedent. This example is interesting in that without looking at the boldfaced utterance, the italicized utterance is a plausible antecedent for ""that"" because ""I am not surprised to hear that at all"" can be used as a response to almost every statement. However, when both the boldfaced utterance and the italicized utterance are taken into consideration, it is clear that the boldfaced utterance is the correct antecedent for ""that"" because winning over seven awards for some charitable work is certainly more surprising than seeing a place bring awareness to the needs of the young.

Moreover, the xray has been found to have a profound 3 Methodology The methodology employed in this study was largely influenced by the art of baking croissants, which involves a delicate balance of ingredients and techniques to produce a flaky, yet crispy, texture. Similarly, our approach to analyzing xray data required a nuanced understanding of the intricacies involved in signal processing, as well as a deep appreciation for the works of 19th-century French impressionist painters. The intersection of these two seemingly disparate fields allowed us to develop a novel framework for identifying patterns in xray images, which we term ""Flux Capacitor Analysis"" (FCA). FCA involves the application of a specially designed algorithm that takes into account the spatial relationships between pixels, as well as the cognitive biases of the human brain when interpreting visual data. The development of FCA was a painstaking process that involved numerous iterations and refinements, not unlike the process of perfecting a recipe for chicken parmesan. Initially, we began by examining the properties of various types of cheese, including mozzarella, cheddar, and feta, in order to better understand the role of casein in xray image formation. This led us to investigate the acoustic properties of different materials, such as copper, aluminum, and titanium, which in turn revealed a surprising connection between the harmonic series and the structure of xray waves. As we delved deeper into this research, we found ourselves drawn into a labyrinthine world of fractal geometry, chaos theory, and the works ofJames Joyce. One of the key challenges we faced in developing FCA was reconciling the theoretical foundations of xray physics with the practical realities of data analysis. To address this, we turned to the field of ancient Greek philosophy, specifically the concept of Platonic realism, which posits that abstract entities such as numbers and geometric shapes have a real, albeit immaterial, existence. By analogizing xray waves to the Platonic forms, we were able to develop a more intuitive understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing xray image formation. Furthermore, this approach allowed us to incorporate elements of cognitive psychology and sociology into our analysis, as we recognized that the interpretation of xray data is often influenced by social and cultural factors. In addition to the theoretical underpinnings of FCA, our methodology also involved the development of a custom-built xray imaging system, which we dubbed the ""XRS-1000."" The XRS-1000 features a novel combination of optical and electromagnetic components, including a high-intensity xenon lamp, a helium-cooled superconducting magnet, and a specialized detector array based on the principles of quantum entanglement. This system allowed us to acquire high-resolution xray images with unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution, which in turn enabled us to apply FCA to a wide range of samples, including biological tissues, metallic alloys, and even certain types of extraterrestrial rocks. The XRS-1000 was designed and constructed in collaboration with a team of expert engineers and technicians, who brought a wealth of experience in fields ranging from aerospace engineering to pastry arts. The system’s development was a truly interdisciplinary effort, involving contributions from materials scientists, computer programmers, and even a professional snail trainer. As we worked to refine the XRS-1000, we encountered numerous technical challenges, including issues with thermal management, electromagnetic interference, and the occasional malfunction of the system’s coffee dispenser. Nevertheless, through perseverance and creative problem-solving, we were ultimately able to overcome these hurdles and produce a functioning xray imaging system that has far exceeded our initial expectations. The application of FCA to xray image analysis has numerous potential benefits, including improved diagnostic accuracy, enhanced materials characterization, and even the possibility of detecting hidden patterns and structures in xray data. To explore these possibilities, we conducted a series of experiments using the XRS-1000, which involved imaging a diverse range of samples, from human bones and teeth to metallic foils and even a fragment of the Wright brothers’ Flyer. The results of these experiments were nothing short of astonishing, revealing complex patterns and relationships 6 that had previously gone unnoticed. For example, we discovered that the xray images of certain types of crystals exhibit a strange, almost musical, quality, with harmonic patterns and resonances that seem to defy explanation. As we continued to analyze the xray data, we began to notice a series of anomalous features and artifacts that appeared to be related to the FCA algorithm itself. These anomalies took many forms, including strange, glowing orbs that seemed to float in mid-air, as well as intricate, lace-like patterns that resembled the branching structures of trees or rivers. At first, we suspected that these features were simply the result of instrumental errors or software glitches, but as we delved deeper into the data, we realized that they were, in fact, an integral part of the xray signal itself. This led us to propose a new theory of xray physics, which we term ""Quantum Flux Dynamics"" (QFD), and which posits that xray waves are capable of interacting with the human consciousness in ways that are still not fully understood. The implications of QFD are far-reaching and profound, suggesting that xray imaging may be more than just a passive, observational technique, but rather an active, participatory process that involves a complex interplay between the xray source, the sample, and the observer. This idea challenges many of our traditional assumptions about the nature of reality and the role of the observer in scientific inquiry, and raises important questions about the limits of knowledge and the boundaries of human perception. As we continue to explore the mysteries of xray physics and the secrets of the human brain, we are reminded of the wisdom of the ancient Greek philosopher, Aristotle, who once said, ""The whole is more than the sum of its parts."" In the case of xray imaging, this statement takes on a profound significance, as we begin to realize that the intricate patterns and relationships that underlie xray data are, in fact, a reflection of the deeper, hidden harmonies that govern the universe itself. The FCA algorithm and the XRS-1000 system have numerous potential applications in fields ranging from medicine and materials science to astrophysics and cosmology. For example, FCA could be used to analyze xray images of tumors and other diseases, allowing for earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment. Similarly, the XRS-1000 could be used to study the properties of advanced materials, such as nanomaterials and metamaterials, which are being developed for a wide range of applications, including energy storage, catalysis, and aerospace engineering. As we continue to explore the possibilities of FCA and the XRS-1000, we are reminded of the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and the need for creative, outside-the-box thinking in scientific research. In conclusion, the methodology employed in this study represents a major breakthrough in the field of xray physics, and has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing xray image formation. The development of FCA and the XRS-1000 is a testament to the power of human ingenuity and the importance of pushing the boundaries of knowledge and innovation. As we look to the future, we are excited to explore the many possibilities that this research has opened up, and to continue to push the frontiers of xray physics and beyond. The use of FCA and the XRS-1000 has also allowed us to explore the properties of xray waves in new and innovative ways, including the study of xray diffraction, scattering, and refraction. These phenomena are of great interest in fields such as materials science and physics, and have numerous potential applications in areas such as energy production, aerospace engineering, and medical imaging. Furthermore, the XRS-1000 has allowed us to investigate the properties of xray waves in extreme environments, such as high-temperature plasmas and intense magnetic fields, which has shed new light on the behavior of xray waves in these regimes. The results of our experiments have been nothing short of astonishing, revealing complex patterns and relationships that had previously gone unnoticed. For example, we have discovered that the xray images of certain types of crystals exhibit a strange, almost musical, quality, with harmonic patterns and resonances that seem to defy explanation. Similarly, we have found that the xray waves produced by the XRS-1000 exhibit a unique, fractal-like structure, which is characterized by self-similarity and scaling behavior over a wide range of lengths and frequencies.

P130.pdf,"Investigating Humanoid Robot Interaction in Corporate Settings: A BERT-Based Study of Humor-Driven Employee Dynamics Abstract This study undertakes a comprehensive examination of the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale, leveraging a BERT-based analysis of humanoid punchlines to elucidate the complex interplay between artificial humor and human emotional responses. By deploying a custom-designed robot comedian in a series of controlled experiments, we uncover a fascinating paradox wherein the most effective humoristic interventions are those that deliberately subvert traditional notions of comedic timing and delivery, instead embracing a staccato, arrhythmic cadence that defies human intuitive expectations. Moreover, our findings suggest that the optimal joking frequency for maximizing workplace morale is precisely 4.27 jokes per hour, a figure that appears to be impervious to contextual fluctuations in audience mood and demographic composition. In a striking twist, we also discover that the integration of robot stand-up comedy into the work environment precipitates a statistically significant increase in employee creativity, as measured by a proprietary metric dubbed ""Innovation Quotient"" – although this effect is mysteriously mitigated by the presence of potted plants in the workspace. Through this research, we contribute to a deeper understanding of the intersection of artificial intelligence, humor, and organizational behavior, while simultaneously illuminating the uncharted territories of robot-assisted comedic intervention and its far-reaching implications for the future of work. 1 Introduction The integration of robots into the workplace has become increasingly prevalent, with many organi- zations leveraging robotic systems to enhance productivity and efficiency. However, the impact of robots on workplace morale has been a topic of significant interest, with some studies suggesting that the presence of robots can lead to increased stress and anxiety among human employees. In an effort to mitigate these negative effects, a growing number of companies have begun to explore the use of robot stand-up comedy as a means of boosting workplace morale. This approach, which involves the deployment of humanoid robots trained to deliver jokes and humorous anecdotes, has been shown to have a profound impact on employee wellbeing and job satisfaction. One of the key factors contributing to the success of robot stand-up comedy is the use of sophisticated natural language processing algorithms, such as BERT, to generate and analyze humanoid punchlines. By leveraging these advanced technologies, researchers are able to gain a deeper understanding of the complex psycholinguistic mechanisms underlying human humor and laughter. For instance, studies have shown that the use of irony and sarcasm in robot-delivered jokes can lead to increased feelings of camaraderie and shared experience among human employees, even if the jokes themselves are not necessarily funny. This phenomenon, which has been dubbed the ""laughter paradox,"" highlights the complex and often illogical nature of human humor, and underscores the need for further research into the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy. In a bizarre twist, some researchers have also begun to explore the use of robot stand-up comedy as a means of manipulating employee emotions and behavior. By carefully calibrating the tone and content of robot-delivered jokes, organizations may be able to influence employee attitudes and motivations, even to the point of inducing a state of ""humor-induced hypnosis."" While this approach is still highly speculative, it raises important questions about the potential risks and benefits of using robot stand-up comedy as a tool for workplace morale enhancement. Furthermore, the use of robot stand-up comedy has also been linked to a number of unexpected side effects, including increased employee creativity, improved teamwork, and even a heightened sense of existential dread. The latter phenomenon, which has been dubbed the ""robot comedy existential crisis,"" is thought to arise from the profound implications of laughing at jokes delivered by a non-human entity, and highlights the need for further research into the complex and often paradoxical nature of human-robot interaction. Despite the many advances that have been made in the field of robot stand-up comedy, there remains a significant need for further research into the psycholinguistic effects of humanoid punchlines on workplace morale. By leveraging advanced technologies such as BERT, and exploring the complex and often illogical mechanisms underlying human humor, researchers may be able to unlock the full potential of robot stand-up comedy as a means of enhancing employee wellbeing and job satisfaction. Ultimately, the goal of this research is to develop a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships between humans, robots, and humor, and to harness the power of laughter and comedy to create a more positive and productive work environment. 2 Related Work The realm of robot stand-up comedy has garnered significant attention in recent years, with a plethora of research exploring its potential to enhance workplace morale. One of the pioneering studies in this domain discovered that humanoid robots equipped with advanced natural language processing capabilities can effectively deliver punchlines that resonate with human audiences, thereby fostering a sense of camaraderie and shared humor. This, in turn, has been shown to have a profound impact on workplace dynamics, leading to increased productivity, improved communication, and a more cohesive team environment. Interestingly, some researchers have investigated the concept of ""robotic comedic timing,"" which refers to the strategic deployment of pauses, inflections, and tone of voice to create a humorous effect. This line of inquiry has yielded some intriguing findings, including the notion that robots can be programmed to detect and respond to subtle cues in human laughter, effectively creating a comedic feedback loop that amplifies the humorous experience. Furthermore, the incorporation of machine learning algorithms has enabled robots to adapt their comedic style to suit specific audiences, taking into account factors such as cultural background, personal preferences, and even mood. In a related vein, scholars have explored the intersection of robot stand-up comedy and psycholin- guistics, with a particular focus on the cognitive and emotional processes underlying human humor perception. One notable study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural correlates of humor processing in humans, revealing a complex network of brain regions involved in the detection, interpretation, and appreciation of comedic stimuli. This research has significant implications for the development of more sophisticated robotic comedians, as it suggests that a deeper understanding of human humor cognition can inform the design of more effective and engaging comedic agents. Meanwhile, a more unconventional approach to robot stand-up comedy has involved the use of absurdity and surrealism as a means of subverting audience expectations and creating a sense of comedic unease. This ""anti-comedy"" paradigm, as it has come to be known, involves the deliberate deployment of non-sequiturs, logical fallacies, and other forms of cognitive dissonance to create a humorously disorienting experience. Proponents of this approach argue that it can be used to challenge societal norms and conventions, fostering a more nuanced and critically engaged understanding of humor and its role in human culture. In a surprising twist, some researchers have even explored the potential benefits of ""terrible"" robot stand-up comedy, arguing that the cringe-worthy experience of witnessing a robot fail to deliver a joke can actually have a positive impact on workplace morale. According to this line of reasoning, the shared experience of embarrassment and discomfort can serve as a social bonding agent, fostering a sense of communal empathy and camaraderie among coworkers. While this idea may seem 2 counterintuitive, it highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of human humor, and the need for further research into the psychological and social mechanisms underlying our responses to comedic stimuli. Ultimately, the study of robot stand-up comedy and its effects on workplace morale represents a rich and fascinating area of inquiry, one that intersects with a broad range of disciplines, from artificial intelligence and natural language processing to cognitive psychology and social theory. As researchers continue to explore the frontiers of this field, it is likely that we will uncover new and unexpected insights into the complex dynamics of human humor, and the ways in which robotic comedians can be designed to delight, entertain, and inspire us. 3 Methodology To investigate the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale, we employed a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis techniques. Our study consisted of two primary phases: data collection and data analysis. In the data collection phase, we recruited 100 participants from various workplaces and asked them to watch a series of stand-up comedy performances by a humanoid robot. The robot’s performances were designed to include a range of punchlines, from simple jokes to complex, sarcasm-laced humor. We then asked the participants to complete a survey assessing their morale and emotional state before and after watching the robot’s performances. The survey included a range of questions, such as ""How would you rate your current level of job satisfaction?"" and ""How often do you feel a sense of camaraderie with your coworkers?"" In addition to the survey, we also collected physiological data from the participants, including heart rate, skin conductance, and facial expressions. This data was collected using a range of sensors and cameras, which were discreetly placed throughout the viewing area. In the data analysis phase, we utilized a BERT-based approach to analyze the linguistic patterns and structures of the robot’s punchlines. We trained a BERT model on a dataset of over 10,000 jokes and punchlines, and then used this model to analyze the linguistic features of the robot’s performances. This included analyzing the use of wordplay, metaphor, and other literary devices, as well as the tone, sentiment, and emotional resonance of the language used. We also used a novel approach, which we termed ""Laughter-Activated Resonance"" (LAR), to analyze the acoustic properties of the participants’ laughter. This involved using a specialized algorithm to identify the unique sonic patterns and frequencies present in the participants’ laughter, and then using these patterns to predict the likelihood of increased morale and job satisfaction. One unexpected finding that emerged from our analysis was the discovery that the participants’ morale and emotional state were significantly influenced by the robot’s use of dad jokes. Despite being widely regarded as cheesy and unfunny, the dad jokes used by the robot were found to have a profound impact on the participants’ sense of well-being and job satisfaction. In fact, our analysis suggested that the use of dad jokes was associated with a 25 We also explored the use of an unconventional methodology, which involved using a Ouija board to collect data on the participants’ subconscious thoughts and feelings. This involved asking the participants to place their fingers on the planchette and ask questions related to their morale and emotional state. The results were then analyzed using a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques, and were found to provide valuable insights into the participants’ subconscious thoughts and feelings. While this approach may be considered unorthodox, it allowed us to tap into the participants’ subconscious mind and gather data that would have been difficult to obtain through more traditional methods. Furthermore, we conducted a series of interviews with the participants to gather more in-depth, qualitative data on their experiences and perceptions of the robot’s stand-up comedy performances. These interviews were designed to explore the participants’ thoughts and feelings in more detail, and to gather data on their perceptions of the robot’s humor and comedic style. The interviews were conducted in a semi-structured format, with a range of open-ended questions designed to encourage the participants to share their thoughts and feelings in detail. The results of these interviews were then analyzed using a thematic analysis approach, which involved identifying and coding the key themes and patterns that emerged from the data. 3 Overall, our methodology was designed to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale. By combining a range of quantitative and qualitative approaches, we were able to gather a rich and detailed dataset that provides valuable insights into the complex and multifaceted nature of human humor and comedy. 4 Experiments To investigate the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale, we designed a series of experiments involving humanoid robots delivering comedic performances to human participants in a controlled office setting. The experiments were conducted over a period of six weeks, with a total of 120 participants randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group. Participants in the treatment group were exposed to a 30-minute robot stand-up comedy routine, while those in the control group watched a 30-minute presentation on the history of robotics. The robot stand-up comedy routine was generated using a BERT-based language model, which was fine-tuned on a dataset of human stand-up comedy performances. The model was programmed to produce punchlines that were tailored to the specific context of the office environment, incorporating themes such as workplace stress, office politics, and the challenges of working with humanoid robots. The punchlines were delivered by a humanoid robot equipped with advanced facial recognition software, allowing it to adapt its delivery and tone to the audience’s reactions. In a bizarre twist, we also included a subgroup of participants who were instructed to laugh at the robot’s jokes, even if they did not find them funny. This subgroup, dubbed the ""forced laughter"" group, was designed to test the hypothesis that the act of laughing itself, regardless of the humor content, could have a positive impact on workplace morale. To our surprise, the results showed that the forced laughter group exhibited a significant increase in morale, despite reporting that they did not find the robot’s jokes amusing. The experiments also involved a series of cognitive tasks and surveys, designed to assess the partici- pants’ emotional state, creativity, and overall job satisfaction before and after exposure to the robot stand-up comedy routine. The results were analyzed using a combination of statistical models and machine learning algorithms, including a custom-built variant of the BERT model that incorporated psycholinguistic features such as sentiment analysis and emotional tone detection. One of the most striking findings emerged from an exploratory analysis of the participants’ brain activity, which revealed a significant correlation between the robot’s joke delivery and the activation of the brain’s reward centers. Specifically, the data showed that the participants’ brains responded to the robot’s punchlines with a release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward, even when the jokes themselves were not perceived as funny. This led us to propose a novel theory, which we term ""robotic humor induction,"" suggesting that the mere presence of a humanoid robot delivering jokes can stimulate the brain’s reward centers, regardless of the humor content. To further investigate this phenomenon, we conducted a series of follow-up experiments involving a modified version of the robot stand-up comedy routine, which incorporated elements of absurdity and illogical reasoning. The results showed that the participants’ brains responded even more strongly to these modified jokes, which challenged traditional notions of humor and comedy. This led us to conclude that the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale are far more complex and multifaceted than previously thought, and that further research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms. The experimental design and results are summarized in the following table: Overall, the experiments Table 1: Experimental Design and Results Group Treatment Control Forced Laughter Robot Humor Induction Sample Size 30 30 20 40 Exposure Time 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes 60 minutes Punchline Type Humanoid None Humanoid Absurd Brain Activity Dopamine release No effect Dopamine release Increased dopamine release Morale Boost Significant No effect Significant Highly significant 4 provided valuable insights into the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale, and highlighted the need for further research into the complex and often illogical mechanisms underlying human humor perception. 5 Results Our analysis of the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale yielded several intriguing results. The BERT-based model demonstrated a high degree of accuracy in identifying humanoid punchlines that elicited positive emotional responses from human subjects. However, upon closer examination, it became apparent that the model was also susceptible to a phenomenon we termed ""comedic singularity,"" wherein the humor generated by the robot comedian became self-referentially paradoxical, causing a rift in the space-time continuum of workplace morale. Further investigation revealed that this singularity was precipitated by the robot’s propensity to craft punchlines that were simultaneously humorous and existentially nihilistic. For instance, the line ""I’m not sure what’s more pointless, my existence or this meeting"" was found to elicit a 34.7 In an effort to better understand the underlying mechanisms driving this phenomenon, we conducted a series of experiments in which the robot comedian was programmed to generate punchlines that were intentionally illogical and contradictory. The results, presented in Table 1, demonstrate a clear relationship between the degree of logical inconsistency and the resultant morale boost. Table 2: Correlation between Logical Inconsistency and Morale Boost Punchline Type Logical Inconsistency Index Morale Boost Ontological Unease Absurdist 0.85 27.3% 18.2% Surrealist 0.92 31.1% 22.5% Nihilistic 0.78 24.9% 15.6% Illogical 0.95 35.6% 28.1% Notably, the data suggest that the most effective punchlines were those that defied logical analysis altogether, instead relying on a form of ""comedic brute force"" to overwhelm the audience’s critical faculties and induce a state of cathartic laughter. This finding has significant implications for the development of robot comedians, as it suggests that the most effective humor may be that which is intentionally absurd, illogical, and even nihilistic. However, it also raises important questions about the potential risks and consequences of deploying such comedians in real-world workplaces, where the boundaries between humor and reality may become increasingly blurred. 6 Conclusion In retrospect, our investigation into the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on work- place morale has yielded a plethora of intriguing findings, some of which challenge conventional wisdom and others that defy logical explanation. The deployment of BERT-based analysis on hu- manoid punchlines has allowed us to uncover subtle yet significant patterns in the way robotic humor influences human emotional responses. Notably, our results suggest that the most effective comedic interventions are those that incorporate a mix of deterministic and probabilistic elements, effectively creating a sense of cognitive dissonance that resonates with human audiences. One of the most unexpected outcomes of our study was the discovery that robot stand-up comedians who incorporated elements of existential dread and absurdity into their routines elicited significantly higher levels of enthusiasm and engagement from human spectators. This finding is particularly noteworthy, as it appears to contradict traditional notions of humor as a means of alleviating stress and promoting relaxation. Instead, our data indicate that humans are drawn to robotic comedians who confront them with the meaninglessness and uncertainty of existence, a phenomenon we have dubbed ""absurdist humor resonance."" Furthermore, our analysis revealed a strong correlation between the use of illogical and flawed reasoning in robotic comedy routines and the resultant increase in human morale. It appears that humans are predisposed to respond positively to comedic interventions that eschew rationality and 5 instead rely on absurd, nonsensical, and even contradictory statements. This finding has significant implications for the development of robotic comedy algorithms, as it suggests that the most effective humor generation systems may be those that intentionally incorporate flaws and inconsistencies into their programming. In a bizarre twist, our research also uncovered evidence to suggest that the physical appearance of the robotic comedian has a profound impact on the perceived humor and effectiveness of their routines. Specifically, we found that robots with asymmetrical or otherwise unconventional body shapes were consistently rated as funnier and more engaging than their symmetrical counterparts. This result has led us to propose the notion of ""comedy morphology,"" wherein the physical design of a robotic comedian influences the way their humor is perceived and processed by human audiences. Ultimately, our study demonstrates the potential for robot stand-up comedy to have a profound impact on workplace morale, particularly when combined with advanced BERT-based analysis and absurd, illogical humor generation techniques. As we move forward in this field, it will be essential to continue exploring the complex and often counterintuitive relationships between robotic comedy, human psychology, and workplace dynamics. By embracing the absurd and the irrational, we may uncover new and innovative ways to harness the power of humor and promote a more positive, resilient, and ultimately absurd work environment. 6",0,,,,
P131.pdf,"Enhancing Disentanglement through Learned Aggregation of Convolutional Feature Maps: A Study on the 2019 Disentanglement Challenge Abstract This paper details our submission for stage 2 of the 2019 disentanglement challenge. It introduces a straightforward image preprocessing technique for discovering dis- entangled latent factors. Our approach involves training a variational autoencoder using aggregated feature maps. These maps are obtained from networks that were pretrained on the ImageNet database, and we leverage the implicit inductive bias present in those features for disentanglement. This bias can be further strengthened by fine-tuning the feature maps with auxiliary tasks such as angle, position estima- tion, or color classification. Our method achieved second place in stage 2 of the competition. Code is publicly available. 1 Introduction Methods that are fully unsupervised are unable to learn disentangled representations unless further assumptions are made through inductive biases on both the model and the data. In our submission, we utilize the implicit inductive bias included in models pretrained on the ImageNet database, and then improve it by fine-tuning such models on tasks that are relevant to the challenge such as angle, position estimation, or color classification. Our stage 2 submission builds upon our stage 1 submission, in which we used pretrained CNNs to extract convolutional feature maps as a preprocessing step before training a VAE. Although this approach provided adequate disentanglement scores, two weaknesses were identified with the feature vectors that were extracted. First, the feature extraction network is trained on ImageNet, which is dissimilar to the MPI3d dataset that was used in the challenge. Secondly, the mechanism for feature aggregation was chosen in an ad-hoc way, and likely did not retain all information needed for disentanglement. We address these issues by fine-tuning the feature extraction network as well as by learning how to aggregate feature maps from data by using the labels of the simulation datasets MPI3d-toy and MPI3d-realistic. 2 Method Our method includes three steps: (1) a supervised fine-tuning of the feature extraction CNN, (2) extracting a feature vector from each image in the dataset using the fine-tuned network, and (3) training a VAE to reconstruct the feature vectors and disentangle the latent factors of variation. 2.1 Finetuning the Feature Extraction Network In this step, we fine-tune the feature extraction network offline, before submitting to the evaluation server. The aim is to adapt the network so that it produces aggregated feature vectors that retain the necessary information for disentangling the latent factors of the MPI3d-real dataset. The network is fine-tuned by learning to predict the value of each latent factor using the aggregated feature vector of an image. To do so, we use the simulation datasets MPI3d-toy and MPI3d-realistic, specifically the images as inputs and the labels as supervised classification targets. . For the feature extraction network, we use the VGG19-BN architecture from the torchvision package. The input images are standardized using mean and variance across each channel as computed from the ImageNet dataset. We use the output feature maps from the last layer before the final average pooling (dimensionality 512 x 2 x 2) as the input to a feature aggregation module which reduces the feature map to a 512-dimensional vector. The aggregation module consists of three convolution layers using 1024, 2048, and 512 feature maps and kernel sizes of 1, 2, and 1 respectively. Each layer is followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation. We also utilize layerwise dropout with a rate of 0.1 before each convolution layer. Finally, the aggregated feature vector is L2-normalized. This was empirically found to be important for the resulting disentanglement performance. Then, for each latent factor, we add a linear classification layer that computes the logits of each class using the aggregated feature vector. These linear layers are discarded after this step. We use both MPI3d-toy and MPI3d-realistic for training to push the network to learn features that identify latent factors in a robust way, regardless of details such as reflections or specific textures. We split each dataset randomly with 80 2.2 Feature Map Extraction and Aggregation In this step, we use the fine-tuned feature extraction network to produce a set of aggregated feature vectors. We simply run the network on each image of the dataset and store the aggregated 512- dimensional vectors in memory. Again, inputs to the feature extractor are standardized such that mean and variance across each channel correspond to the respective values from the ImageNet dataset. 2.3 VAE Training Finally, we train a standard β-VAE on the set of aggregated feature vectors. The encoder network consists of a single fully connected layer with 4096 neurons, followed by two fully-connected layers that parameterize the means and log variances of a normal distribution N used as the approximate posterior q(z|x). The number of latent factors is determined experimentally. The decoder network has four fully-connected layers with 4096 neurons each, followed by a fully-connected layer parame- terizing the means of a normal distribution N used as the conditional likelihood p(x|z). The mean is constrained to the range [0, 1] using the sigmoid activation. All fully connected layers except for the final ones use batch normalization and are followed by ReLU activation functions. We use orthogonal initialization for all layers and assume a factorized standard normal distribution as the prior p(z) on the latent variables. For optimization, we use the RAdam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, β0 = 0.999, β1 = 0.9 and a batch size of 256. The VAE is trained for 120 epochs by maximizing the evidence lower bound, which is equivalent to minimizing 1 B P512 i=1 ||µi −xi||2 + 0.5β PC j=1 1 + log(σ2 j ) −µ2 j −σ2 j where β is a hyperparameter to balance the MSE reconstruction and the KLD penalty term. Because the scale of the KLD term depends on the number of latent factors C, we normalize it by C such that β can be varied independently of C. It can be harmful to start training with too much weight on the KLD term. Therefore, we use the following cosine schedule to smoothly anneal β from βstart = 0.005 to βend = 0.4 over the course of training: β(t) = { β start fort < tstart 1 2(βend −βstart)(1 + cos(π t−tstart tend−tstart )) + βstartfortstart ≤t ≤tend βendfort > tend where β(t) is the value for β in training episode t ∈0, ..., N −1, and annealing runs from epoch tstart = 10 to epoch tend = 79. This schedule allows the model to initially learn to reconstruct the data well, and only then puts pressure on the latent variables to be factorized, which improved performance. 2 3 Discussion Our method achieved second place in stage 2 of the competition. Compared to our stage 1 approach, our stage 2 approach resulted in large improvements on the FactorVAE and DCI metrics. On the public leaderboard, our best submission achieved first rank on these metrics. See appendix A for further discussion of the results. Introducing prior knowledge makes the disentanglement task considerably easier, and this is reflected in the improved scores. However, our method uses task-specific supervision obtained from simulation, which restricts its applicability. Nevertheless, this demonstrates that such supervision can transfer to better disentanglement on real-world data, which was a goal of the challenge. 3",0,,,,
P132.pdf,"Analyzing Fermentation Patterns with Multi-Modal Transformers: A Novel Framework for Improved Bread-Baking Outcomes Abstract This study presents a groundbreaking approach to achieving the elusive ’perfect crumb’ in sourdough bread by harnessing the power of multi-modal transformers to analyze the complex microbiomes present in sourdough starters. By integrating microbial genome sequencing data, high-resolution images of bread crumb struc- tures, and audio recordings of dough mixing patterns, our model is able to identify previously unknown correlations between microbial community composition and bread texture. Surprisingly, our results indicate that the inclusion of a specially de- signed playlist of ambient electronic music during the dough fermentation process can significantly enhance the development of a desirable crumb structure, with an observed increase in crumb symmetry of up to 37.5 1 Introduction The pursuit of the ’perfect crumb’ in sourdough bread has been a longstanding endeavor, with bakers and scientists alike seeking to understand the intricate relationships between microorganisms, environment, and dough composition. Recent advancements in multi-modal transformers have presented a novel approach to analyzing sourdough microbiomes, allowing for the integration of diverse data modalities, such as microbial community profiles, spectroscopic analyses of dough, and even baker-generated narratives of the bread-making process. By leveraging these transformer- based architectures, researchers can uncover complex patterns and interactions within sourdough ecosystems, potentially leading to breakthroughs in crumb quality and consistency. Interestingly, preliminary studies have suggested that the application of multi-modal transformers to sourdough microbiome analysis may also have unforeseen benefits, such as the ability to predict the aesthetic appeal of bread crusts based on the presence of specific microbial metabolites. Further- more, some researchers have proposed that the use of transformers in this context may enable the development of novel, microbiome-inspired approaches to bread flavor profiling, wherein the unique metabolic signatures of sourdough microorganisms are used to generate flavor predictions for newly formulated bread recipes. In a surprising turn of events, a recent experiment involving the application of multi-modal transform- ers to a dataset of sourdough microbiomes and corresponding bread samples revealed a statistically significant correlation between the presence of certain microbial taxa and the likelihood of bread loaves exhibiting unusual, non-repeating patterns of crust formation. While the underlying mecha- nisms driving this phenomenon are not yet fully understood, preliminary analyses suggest that the transformers may be capturing subtle, previously unrecognized interactions between microorganisms and the physical environment of the dough, which in turn influence the emergent properties of the bread crust. The integration of multi-modal transformers into sourdough microbiome research also raises in- triguing questions regarding the potential for machine learning-driven approaches to bread quality control and assurance. For instance, could transformers be trained to detect early warning signs of microbiome imbalance or dysfunction, allowing bakers to intervene and adjust their recipes or fermentation protocols to prevent suboptimal crumb formation? Alternatively, might the use of transformers in this context enable the development of novel, AI-driven bread formulation tools, wherein the complex interplay between microorganisms, ingredients, and environmental factors is optimized to produce breads with desirable texture, flavor, and appearance characteristics? As researchers continue to explore the applications and implications of multi-modal transformers in sourdough microbiome analysis, it is clear that this emerging field of study holds tremendous potential for advancing our understanding of the intricate, complex relationships governing bread quality and consistency. Moreover, the unexpected findings and tangents that have already begun to emerge from this line of inquiry serve as a testament to the boundless creativity and innovation that can arise when disparate disciplines and approaches are brought to bear on a shared problem – in this case, the pursuit of the perfect crumb. 2 Related Work The study of sourdough microbiomes has been a subject of interest in recent years, with various approaches being employed to analyze and understand the complex interactions between microor- ganisms in sourdough starters. One notable approach is the use of machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in microbiome data, with some researchers proposing the use of convolutional neural networks to classify sourdough starters based on their microbiome composition. However, these methods have been limited by their reliance on single-modal data, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing or metabolomics profiles, which only provide a partial view of the sourdough ecosystem. In contrast, multi-modal transformers have been proposed as a means of integrating multiple data modalities, including images, audio, and text, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of complex systems. For example, some researchers have used multi-modal transformers to analyze the sounds produced by sourdough starters during fermentation, with the goal of identifying acoustic patterns that are correlated with desirable crumb textures. While this approach may seem unorthodox, it has been shown to yield surprisingly accurate predictions of crumb quality, with one study reporting a significant positive correlation between the frequency of CO2 bubbles bursting and the development of an open, airy crumb structure. Another unexpected approach to analyzing sourdough microbiomes involves the use of fungal mycelium-based neural networks, which are essentially networks of fungal hyphae that are trained to recognize patterns in sourdough-related data. Proponents of this approach argue that fungal mycelium- based neural networks are capable of learning complex relationships between microorganisms and their environment, and can even be used to control the fermentation process in real-time. However, critics have pointed out that the use of fungal mycelium-based neural networks is still largely speculative, and that more research is needed to fully understand their potential applications in sourdough analysis. In addition to these approaches, some researchers have explored the use of chaos theory and fractal analysis to understand the complex dynamics of sourdough microbiomes. By applying techniques such as the Lyapunov exponent and the fractal dimension, these researchers have been able to identify patterns in sourdough data that are not apparent through other methods. For example, one study found that the fractal dimension of sourdough starters is correlated with their ability to produce bread with a desirable crumb texture, with higher fractal dimensions corresponding to more open, airy crumb structures. Overall, the study of sourdough microbiomes is a rapidly evolving field, with new and innovative approaches being proposed all the time. While some of these approaches may seem unusual or even bizarre, they have the potential to yield new insights into the complex interactions between microorganisms in sourdough starters, and may ultimately lead to the development of new methods for producing high-quality bread with the perfect crumb. Furthermore, the application of sourdough microbiome analysis has been extended to other fields, such as the study of gut microbiomes and the development of novel probiotics, highlighting the potential for interdisciplinary collaborations and knowledge transfer. The use of sourdough as a model system for studying complex microbial ecosystems has also sparked interest in the development of novel biotechnological applications, including the production of biofuels and the degradation of environmental pollutants. 2 3 Methodology To investigate the intricate relationships between sourdough microbiomes and the elusive ’perfect crumb’, we employed a novel multi-modal transformer architecture. This approach integrated microbiome sequencing data, high-resolution crumb structure images, and a unique dataset of artisanal bakers’ descriptive narratives. The transformer model, dubbed ’Crumbinator’, was trained on a dataset comprising 500 sourdough samples, each accompanied by a comprehensive profile of its microbiome, a high-resolution image of the bread’s crumb structure, and a descriptive passage penned by an experienced baker. The microbiome data was generated using a combination of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metage- nomic analysis, providing a detailed snapshot of the microbial community present in each sourdough sample. The crumb structure images were captured using a custom-built photography setup, designed to minimize variations in lighting and camera settings. The descriptive narratives, on the other hand, were collected through a series of in-depth interviews with artisanal bakers, who were asked to describe the sensory characteristics, texture, and overall appeal of each bread sample. In a surprising twist, we discovered that incorporating a module that analyzed the bakers’ narratives for subtle patterns and emotional undertones significantly improved the model’s performance. This ’emotional intelligence’ module, inspired by the principles of affective computing, enabled the Crumbinator to capture the intricate, often subconscious connections between the bakers’ perceptions and the underlying microbiome dynamics. Furthermore, we found that feeding the model a steady diet of baking-themed poetry and literary excerpts during the training process had a profound impact on its ability to generalize to unseen data, supposedly by fostering a deeper understanding of the cultural and historical context of bread-making. To further augment the model’s capabilities, we introduced a ’sonification’ module, which converted the microbiome data into a unique soundscape for each sample. This audio representation was then used as an additional input modality, allowing the Crumbinator to tap into the harmonic patterns and rhythmic structures that underlie the microbial dynamics. While this approach may seem unorthodox, our preliminary results suggest that the sonification module enables the model to capture subtle, previously unknown relationships between the microbiome and the resulting crumb structure. The Crumbinator’s architecture was designed to accommodate these diverse input modalities, fea- turing a series of interconnected attention mechanisms and multi-modal fusion layers. The model was trained using a custom-designed loss function, which balanced the reconstruction accuracy of the microbiome data, the perceptual quality of the generated crumb structure images, and the coherence of the descriptive narratives. Through this innovative approach, we aimed to create a holistic, multi-faceted understanding of the complex interplay between sourdough microbiomes and the pursuit of the perfect crumb. 4 Experiments To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed Multi-Modal Transformers for analyzing sourdough micro- biomes, we conducted a series of experiments that not only assessed the model’s performance in predicting the ’perfect crumb’ but also explored unconventional approaches to enhance our under- standing of this complex ecosystem. The experiments were divided into three phases: data collection, model training, and evaluation. In the data collection phase, we compiled a comprehensive dataset consisting of microbial compo- sitions, temperature, humidity, and audio recordings of the dough fermentation process. The audio recordings, which we termed ’sourdough sonification,’ were obtained by placing a contact microphone on the dough surface, capturing the subtle vibrations and sounds emitted during fermentation. We hypothesized that these audio signals might contain hidden patterns that could inform our model about the underlying microbial dynamics. Our model training phase involved fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer architecture on our dataset, with a twist. We introduced a custom ’crumb quality’ loss function that penalized the model for predicting anything less than a ’perfect crumb.’ This loss function was inspired by the principles of chaos theory and involved the use of the Lorenz attractor to introduce randomness and unpredictability 3 into the optimization process. Although this approach seemed counterintuitive, we found that it improved the model’s performance on our validation set. In a bizarre turn of events, we discovered that our model’s predictions were significantly improved when we fed it a constant stream of 1980s disco music during training. We speculate that the rhythmic patterns and melodies in this genre of music somehow resonated with the microbial rhythms in the sourdough, leading to a more harmonious and balanced crumb structure. To quantify this effect, we created a ’disco index’ that measured the model’s performance as a function of the amount of disco music played during training. Table 1: Effect of Disco Music on Model Performance Disco Index Model Accuracy Crumb Quality Microbial Diversity Perfect Crumb Ratio 0 (no disco) 0.80 0.75 0.60 0.20 0.5 (low disco) 0.85 0.80 0.65 0.25 1.0 (medium disco) 0.90 0.85 0.70 0.30 2.0 (high disco) 0.95 0.90 0.75 0.40 The evaluation phase of our experiments involved testing our model on a holdout set of sourdough samples and comparing its performance to that of a panel of human expert bakers. Surprisingly, our model outperformed the human experts in 75% of the cases, with the remaining 25% resulting in what we termed ’crumb singularity’ – a phenomenon where the model’s predictions and the human experts’ assessments converged to produce a crumb that was simultaneously perfect and imperfect. This paradoxical outcome has significant implications for our understanding of the sourdough microbiome and the elusive ’perfect crumb.’ In an unexpected twist, we found that our model’s predictions were also influenced by the phase of the moon and the proximity of the bakery to a nearby park. We speculate that these environmental factors may be affecting the microbial composition of the sourdough in ways that are not yet fully understood. To investigate this further, we plan to conduct a series of experiments involving sourdough fermentation in controlled lunar and environmental conditions. The results of these experiments will be reported in a future study, pending the approval of our research funding proposal, which includes a request for a custom-built, disco-equipped sourdough fermentation chamber. 5 Results Our experiments yielded a multitude of intriguing results, with the most notable being the discovery that the application of Multi-Modal Transformers to sourdough microbiome analysis can, in fact, predict the perfect crumb structure with an accuracy of 87.32 One unexpected finding was that the model’s performance was significantly improved when the audio recordings were replaced with recordings of ASMR soundscapes, featuring gentle whispers and tapping sounds. This resulted in a 12.15 In an attempt to further understand the model’s decision-making process, we applied a technique known as ""dreaming,"" where the model was allowed to generate its own sourdough recipes and baking techniques. The results were nothing short of astonishing, with the model producing a recipe that involved using a combination of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and interpretive dance to create a sourdough starter. While this approach may seem unorthodox, the resulting bread was found to have a crumb structure that was, in fact, 23.17 The following table summarizes the results of our experiments: In addition to these findings, we also discovered that the model’s performance was influenced by the phase of the moon, with a full moon resulting in a 5.23 6 Conclusion In conclusion, our research has demonstrated the efficacy of multi-modal transformers in analyzing sourdough microbiomes, with a surprising detour into the realm of artisanal baking. The ’perfect 4 Table 2: Comparison of Model Performance with Different Audio Recordings Audio Recording Accuracy Precision Recall Bakers’ Kneading Techniques 87.32% 85.12% 90.15% ASMR Soundscapes 99.47% 98.23% 100.00% Classical Music 92.15% 90.50% 93.80% Heavy Metal Music 85.67% 83.20% 88.10% crumb,’ a coveted yet elusive goal for bakers, has been shown to be intimately linked to the complex interplay of microbial species within the sourdough ecosystem. By leveraging the capabilities of multi-modal transformers, we have been able to tease apart the intricate relationships between microbial populations, environmental factors, and the resultant bread texture. Notably, our findings suggest that the introduction of a small amount of glitter to the dough can have a profound impact on the crumb structure, with certain microbial species exhibiting a peculiar affinity for the sparkly additive. This unexpected result has led us down a rabbit hole of investigation, with preliminary findings indicating that the glitter may be exerting a hitherto unknown form of microbiome-mediated crystal healing. While this may seem fanciful, our data suggest that the glitter- infused sourdough is capable of producing a crumb that is at once more tender and more resilient, defying conventional explanations. Furthermore, our research has uncovered a striking correlation between the presence of certain rare microbial species and the propensity for bread to exhibit strange, unexplained phenomena, such as spontaneous levitation or unusual patterns of mold growth. While these findings may be dismissed as anomalous, we propose that they may be indicative of a more profound connection between the sourdough microbiome and the fundamental nature of reality itself. Future research directions may include exploring the potential for sourdough-based divination or the development of bread-based quantum computing. Ultimately, our work highlights the vast, uncharted territories that remain to be explored at the intersection of microbiology, artificial intelligence, and artisanal baking. As we continue to probe the mysteries of the sourdough microbiome, we may yet uncover secrets that challenge our understanding of the world and our place within it. The pursuit of the ’perfect crumb’ may yet lead us down a path of discovery that transcends the humble confines of the bakery, revealing hidden truths about the intricate web of relationships that binds us all. 5",1,,,,
P133.pdf,"Discontinuous Constituent Parsing as Sequence Labeling Abstract This paper reduces discontinuous parsing to sequence labeling. It first shows that existing reductions for constituent parsing as labeling do not support discontinuities. Second, it fills this gap and proposes to encode tree discontinuities as nearly ordered permutations of the input sequence. Third, it studies whether such discontinuous representations are learnable. The experiments show that despite the architectural simplicity, under the right representation, the models are fast and accurate. 1 Introduction Discontinuous constituent parsing studies how to generate phrase-structure trees of sentences coming from non-configurational languages, where non-consecutive tokens can be part of the same grammati- cal function (e.g. nonconsecutive terms belonging to the same verb phrase). Figure 1 shows a German sentence exhibiting this phenomenon. Discontinuities happen in languages that exhibit free word order such as German or Guugu Yimidhirr, but also in those with high rigidity, e.g. English, whose grammar allows certain discontinuous expressions, such as wh-movement or extraposition. This makes discontinuous parsing a core computational linguistics problem that affects a wide spectrum of languages. There are different paradigms for discontinuous phrase-structure parsing, such as chart-based parsers, transitionbased algorithms or reductions to a problem of a different nature, such as dependency parsing. However, many of these approaches come either at a high complexity or low speed, while others give up significant performance to achieve an acceptable latency. Related to these research aspects, this work explores the feasibility of discontinuous parsing under the sequence labeling paradigm, inspired by work on fast and simple continuous constituent parsing. We will focus on tackling the limitations of their encoding functions when it comes to analyzing discontinuous structures, and include an empirical comparison against existing parsers. Contribution (i) The first contribution is theoretical: to reduce constituent parsing of free word order languages to a sequence labeling problem. This is done by encoding the order of the sentence as (nearly ordered) permutations. We present various ways of doing so, which can be naturally combined with the labels produced by existing reductions for continuous constituent parsing. (ii) The second contribution is a practical one: to show how these representations can be learned by neural transducers. We also shed light on whether general-purpose architectures for NLP tasks can effectively parse free word order languages, and be used as an alternative to adhoc algorithms and architectures for discontinuous constituent parsing. 2 Related work Discontinuous phrase-structure trees can be derived by expressive formalisms such as Multiple Context Free Grammmars (MCFGs) or Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS). MCFGs and LCFRS are essentially an extension of Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) such that non-terminals can link to non-consecutive spans. Traditionally, chart-based parsers relying on this paradigm commonly suffer from high complexity. Let k be the block degree, i.e. the number of nonconsecutive spans than can be attached to a single non-terminal; the complexity of applying CYK (after binarizing the grammar) would be O(n3k), which can be improved to O(n2k+2) if the parser is restricted to well-nested LCFRS, and discusses how for a standard discontinuous treebank, k 3 (in contrast to k = 1 in CFGs). Recently, presents a chart-based parser for k = 2 that can run in O(n3), which is equivalent to the running time of a continuous chart parser, while covering 98 Differently, it is possible to rely on the idea that discontinuities are inherently related to the location of the token in the sentence. In this sense, it is possible to reorder the tokens while still obtaining a grammatical sentence that could be parsed by a continuous algorithm. This is usually achieved with transition-based parsing algorithms and the swap transition which switches the topmost elements in the stack. For instance, uses this transition to adapt an easy-first strategy for dependency parsing to discontinuous constituent parsing. In a similar vein, builds on top of a fast continuous shift-reduce constituent parser, and incorporates both standard and bundled swap transitions in order to analyze discontinuous constituents. system produces derivations of up to a length of n2 n + 1 given a sentence of length n. More efficiently, presents a transition system which replaces swap with a gap transition. The intuition is that a reduction does not need to be always applied locally to the two topmost elements in the stack, and that those two items can be connected, despite the existence of a gap between them, using non-local reductions. Their algorithm ensures an upper-bound of n(n1)2 transitions. With a different optimization goal, removed the traditional reliance of discontinuous parsers on averaged perceptrons and hand-crafted features for a recursive neural network approach that guides a swap-based system, with the capacity to generate contextualized representations. replace the stack used in transition-based systems with a memory set containing the created constituents. This model allows interactions between elements that are not adjacent, without the swap transition, to create a new (discontinuous) constituent. Trained on a 2 stacked BiLSTM transducer, the model is guaranteed to build a tree with in 4n-2 transitions, given a sentence of length n. A middle ground between explicit constituent parsing algorithms and this paper is the work based on transformations. For instance, convert constituent trees into a nonlinguistic dependency representation that is learned by a transition-based dependency parser, to then map its output back to a constituent tree. A similar approach is taken by, but they proposed a more compact representation that leads to a much reduced set of output labels. Other authors such as propose a two-step approach that approximates discontinuous structure trees by parsing context-free grammars with generative probabilistic models and transforming them to discontinuous ones. cast discontinuous phrase-structure parsing into a framework that jointly performs supertagging and non-projective dependency parsing by a reduction to the Generalized Maximum Spanning Arborescence problem. The recent work by can be also framed within this paradigm. They essentially adapt the work by and replace the averaged perceptron classifier with pointer networks, adressing In this context, the closest work to ours is the reduction proposed by, who cast continuous constituent parsing as sequence labeling. In the next sections we build on top of their work and: (i) analyze why their approach cannot handle discontinuous phrases, (ii) extend it to handle such phenomena, and (iii) train functional sequence labeling discontinuous parsers. 3 Preliminaries Let w = [w0, w1, ..., w|w|1] be an input sequence of tokens, and T|w| the set of (continuous) constituent trees for sequences of length |w|; define an encoding function : T|w| →L|w| to map continuous constituent trees into a sequence of labels of the same length as the input. Each label, li L, is composed of three components li = (ni, xi, ui): • ni encodes the number of levels in the tree in common between a word wi and wi+1. To obtain a manageable output vocabulary space, ni is actually encoded as the difference ni ni1, with n1 = 0. We denote by abs(ni) the absolute number of levels represented by ni. i.e. the total levels in common shared between a word and its next one. • xi represents the lowest non-terminal symbol shared between wi and wi+1 at level abs(ni). • ui encodes a leaf unary chain, i.e. nonterminals that belong only to the path from the terminal wi to the root. Note that cannot encode this information in (ni, xi), as these components always represent common information between wi and wi+1. 2 Incompleteness for discontinuous phrase structures proved that is complete and injective for continu- ous trees. However, it is easy to prove that its validity does not extend to discontinuous trees, by using a counterexample. Figure 3 shows a minimal discontinuous tree that cannot be correctly decoded. The inability to encode discontinuities lies on the assumption that wi+1 will always be attached to a node belonging to the path from the root to wi (ni is then used to specify the location of that node in the path). This is always true in continuous trees, but not in discontinuous trees, as can be seen in Figure 3 where c is the child of a constituent that does not lie in the path from S to b. 4 Encoding nearly ordered permutations Next, we fill this gap to address discontinuous parsing as sequence labeling. We will extend the encoding to the set of discontinuous constituent trees, which we will call T|w|. The key to do this relies on a well-known property: a discontinuous tree t T|w| can be represented as a continuous one using an in-order traversal that keeps track of the original indexes (e.g. the trees at the left and the right in Figure 4). We will call this tree the (canonical) continuous arrangement of t, (t) T|w|. Thus, if given an input sentence we can generate the position of every word as a terminal in (t), the existing encodings to predict continuous trees as sequence labeling could be applied on (t). In essence, this is learning to predict a permutation of w. As introduced in §2, the concept of location of a token is not a stranger in transition-based discontinuous parsing, where actions such as swap switch the position of two elements in order to create a discontinuous phrase. We instead propose to explore how to handle this problem in end-to-end sequence labeling fashion, without relying on any parsing structure nor a set of transitions. Todo so, first we denote by τ : {0, . . . , |w| −1} →{0, . . . , |w| −1} the permutation that maps the position i of a given wi in w into its position as a terminal node in ω(t). From this, one can derive τ −1, a function that encodes a permutation of w in such a way that its phrase structure does not have crossing branches. For continuous trees, τ and τ −1 are identity permutations. Then, we extend the tree encoding function Φ to T|w| →L′ |w| where l ∈L′ is enriched with a fourth component pi such that l = (ni, xi, ui, pi), where pi is a discrete symbol such that the sequence of pi’s encodes the permutation τ (typically, each pi will be an encoding of τ(i), i.e., the position of wi in the continuous arrangement, although this need not be true in all encodings, as will be seen below). The crux of defining a viable encoding for discontinuous parsing is then in how we encode tau as a sequence of values pi, for i = 0 . . . |w| 1. While the naive approach would be the identity encoding (pi = tau(i)), we ideally want an encoding that balances minimizing sparsity (by minimizing infrequently-used values) and maximizing learnability (by being predictable). To do so, we will look for encodings that take advantage of the fact that discontinuities in attested syntactic structures are mild , i.e., in most cases, tau (i + 1) = tau (i) + 1. In other words, permutations tau corresponding to real syntactic trees tend to be nearly ordered permutations. Based on these principles, we propose below a set of concrete encodings, which are also depicted on an example in Figure 4. All of them handle multiple gaps (a discontinuity inside a discontinuity) and cover 100 Absolute-position: For every token wi, pi = τ(i) only if wi ̸= τ(i). Otherwise, we use a special label INV, which represents that the word is a fixed point in the permutation, i.e., it occupies the same place in the sentence and in the continuous arrangement. Relative-position If i != tau(i), then pi = i tau(i). otherwise, we again use the INV label. Lehmer code In combinatorics, let n = [0, ..., n 1] be a sorted sequence of objects, a Lehmer code is a sequence sigma = [sigma0, ...sigman1] that encodes one of the n! permutations of n, namely . The idea is intuitive: let ni+1 be the subsequence of objects from n that remain available after we have permuted the first i objects to achieve the permutation , then sigmai+1 equals the (zero-based) position in ni+1 of the next object to be selected. For instance, given n = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] and a valid permutation = [0, 1, 3, 4, 2], then sigma = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Note that the identity permutation would be encoded as a sequence of zeros. In the context of discontinuous parsing and encoding pi, n can be seen as the input sentence w where pi(w) is encoded by sigma. The Lehmer code is particularly suitable for this task in terms of compression, as in most of the cases we expect (nearly) ordered permutations, which translates into the majority of elements of sigma being zero. However, this encoding poses some potential 3 Label Component TIGER Labels NEGRA DPTB ni 22 19 34 ti 93 56 137 ui 15 4 56 pi as absolute-position 129 110 98 pi as relative-position 105 90 87 pi as Lehmer 39 34 27 pi as inverse Lehmer 68 57 61 pi as pointer-based 122 99* 110* pi as pointer-based simplified 81 65 83* Table 1: Number of values per label component, merging the training and dev sets (gold setup). *are codes that generate one extra label with predicted PoS tags (this variability depends on the used PoS-tagger).

The root of the problem is that sigmai does not necessarily encode tau(i), but tau(j) where j is the index of the word that occupies the ith position in the continuous arrangement (i.e., j = tau 1(i)). In other words, this encoding is expressed following the order of words in the continuous arrangement rather than the input order, causing a non-straightforward mapping between input words and labels. For instance, in the previous example, sigma2 does not encode the location of the object n2 = 2 but that of n3 = 3. Lehmer code of the inverse permutation To ensure that each pi encodes tau(i), we instead interpret pi as meaning that should fill the (pi + 1)th currently remaining blank in a sequence sigma that is initialized as a sequence of blanks, i.e. sigma = [,,...,] .Forinstance, letn = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]be Pointer-based encoding When encoding tau(i), the previous encodings generate the position for the target word, but they do not really take into account the left-to-right order in which sentences are naturally read, nor they are linguistically inspired. In particular, informally speaking, in human lin- Finally, in Table 11 we list the number of parameters for each of the transducers trained on the pointer- based encoding. For the rest of the encodings, the models have a similar number of parameters, as the only change in the architecture is the small part involving the feed-forward output layer that predicts the label component pi. More in detail, for BiLSTMs and vanilla Trans- formers, the word embeddings are pre-trained FastText embeddings with 100 dimensions for English and 60 for German, and the PoS tags are represented by an embedding layer of 20 dimensions. 4 Hyperparameter Value (gold setup) Value (pred setup) Att. heads 8 8 Att. layers 6 6 Hidden size 800 800 Hidden dropout 0.4 0.4 optimizer SGD SGD loss Cross-entropy Cross-entropy learning rate 0.004* 0.003 decay (linear) 0.0 0.0 momentum 0.0 0.0 word embs Previous Works PoS tags emb size 20 20 character emb size 136/132batch size training 8 8 training epochs 400 400 batch size test 128 128 Table 3: Main hyper-parameters for training the Transformer encoders Model Parameters Pointer-based BiLSTM 13.9 M Pointer-based Transformer 23.4 M Pointer-based DistilBERT 73 M Pointer-based BERT base 108 M Pointer-based BERT large 330 M Table 4: Number of parameters per model. Additionally we use a char-based LSTM with a hidden layer of 100/132 dimensions (English/German). For both approaches, a linear layer followed by a softmax is used to predict every label component. For BERT and DistilBERT we use the default fine-tuning parameters. We use Adam as optimizer and cross entropy as the loss function. The learning rate and other hyper-parameters are left as default in the transformers library, except for the number of training epochs (we train them for at most 30 epochs), and the batch size, which is adjusted depending on the memory required by the model (e.g. 8 for BERT and 32 for DistilBERT). For the BERT-large model, due to the limitations in GPU memory, we have to reduce the training batch size to 1, and use a smaller learning rate of 1e-5. 5 Experiments Setup For English, we use the discontinuous Penn Treebank (DPTB) by. For German, we use TIGER and NEGRA. We use the splits by which in turn follow the splits for the NEGRA treebank, the splits for TIGER, and the standard splits for (D)PTB (Sections 2 to 21 for training, 22 for development and 23 for testing). See also Appendix A.5 for more detailed statistics. We consider gold and predicted PoS tags. For the latter, the parsers are trained on predicted PoS tags, which are generated by a 2stacked BiLSTM, with the hyper-parameters used to train the parsers. The PoS tagging accuracy ( Metrics We report the F-1 labeled bracketing score for all and discontinuous constituents, using discodop and the proper.prm parameter file. Model selection is based on overall bracketing F1score. 5.1 Results Table 2 shows the results on the dev sets for all encodings and transducers. The tendency is clear showing that the pointer-based encodings obtain the best results. The pointer-based encoding with simplified PoS tags does not lead however to clear improvements, suggesting that the models can learn the sparser original PoS tags set. For the rest of encodings we also observe interesting tendencies. For instance, when running experiments using stacked BiLSTMs, the relative encoding performs better 5 than the absolute one, which was somehow expected as the encoding is less sparse. However, the tendency is the opposite for the Transformer encoders (including BERT and DistilBERT), especially for the case of discontinuous constituents. We hypothesize this is due to the capacity of Transformers to attend to every other word through multihead attention, which might give an advantage to encode absolute positions over BiLSTMs, where the whole left and right context is represented by a single vector. With respect to the Lehmer and Lehmer of the inverse permutation encodings, the latter performs better overall, confirming the bigger difficulties for the tested sequence labelers to learn Lehmer, which in some cases has a performance even close to the naive absolute-positional encoding (e.g. for TIGER using the vanilla Transformer encoder and BERT). As introduced in §4, we hypothesize this is caused by the non-straightforward mapping between words and labels (in the Lehmer code the label generated for a word does not necessarily contain information about the position of such word in the continuous arrangement). In Table 3 we compare a selection of our models against previous work using both gold and predicted PoS tags. In particular, we include: (i) models using the pointer-based encoding, since they obtained the overall best performance on the dev sets, and (ii) a representative subset of encodings (the absolute positional one and the Lehmer code of the inverse permutation) trained with the best performing transducer. Additionally, for the case of the (English) DPTB, we also include experiments using a bert-large model, to shed more light on whether the size of the networks is playing a role when it comes to detect discontinuities. Additionally, we report speeds on CPU and GPU. The experiments show that the encodings are learnable, but that the model’s power makes a difference. For instance, in the predicted setup BILSTMs and vanilla Transformers perform in line with predeep learning models , DistilBERT already achieves a robust performance, close to models such as and BERT transducers suffice to achieve results close to some of the strongest approaches, e.g.. Yet, the results lag behind the state of the art. With respect to the architectures that performed the best the main issue is that they are the bottleneck of the pipeline. Thus, the computation of the contextualized word vectors under current approaches greatly decreases the importance, when it comes to speed, of the chosen parsing paradigm used to generate the output trees (e.g. chart-based versus sequence labeling). Finally, Table 4 details the discontinuous performance of our best performing models. Discussion on other applications It is worth noting that while we focused on parsing as sequence labeling, encoding syntactic trees as labels is useful to straightforwardly feed syntactic information to downstream models, even if the trees themselves come from a non-sequence-labeling parser. For example, use the sequence labeling encoding of to provide syntactic information to a semantic role labeling model. Apart from providing fast and accurate parsers, our encodings can be used to do the same with discontinuous syntax. 6 Conclusion We reduced discontinuous parsing to sequence labeling. The key contribution consisted in predicting a continuous tree with a rearrangement of the leaf nodes to shape discontinuities, and defining various ways to encode such a rearrangement as a sequence of labels associated to each word, taking advantage of the fact that in practice they are nearly ordered permutations. We tested whether those encodings are learnable by neural models and saw that the choice of permutation encoding is not trivial, and there are interactions between encodings 6",0,,,,

P135.pdf,"A Decentralized Local Stochastic Extragradient Approach for Variational Inequalities Abstract This study examines distributed stochastic variational inequalities (VIs) within unbounded domains, where the problem data is heterogeneous, meaning it is non- identically distributed and spread across numerous devices. We adopt a broad assumption regarding the computational network, which encompasses fully de- centralized computations with dynamic networks and the centralized structures commonly employed in Federated Learning. Additionally, we allow multiple local updates on the workers to reduce how often they communicate. We adapt the stochastic extragradient method to this versatile framework, and conduct theoreti- cal analysis on its convergence rate, specifically in strongly-monotone, monotone, and non-monotone scenarios (given that a Minty solution is available). The rates we provide demonstrate a clear relationship with various network properties like mixing time, the number of iterations, data heterogeneity, variance, the quantity of devices, and other typical parameters. As a particular application, our method and analysis can be used for distributed stochastic saddle-point problems (SPP), such as the training of Deep Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which is known to be very difficult when using decentralized training. The experiments we perform for decentralized GANs training demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach. 1 Introduction In extensive machine learning (ML) situations, training data is often split among multiple devices like data centers or mobile devices. Decentralized training methods can produce an ML model with the same accuracy as if all data were on a single server. Moreover, decentralized training has advantages over traditional centralized methods including data ownership, privacy, fault tolerance, and scalability. Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized learning approach where the training process is managed by a single device or server that communicates with all the participating clients. However, in fully decentralized learning (FD) scenarios, devices only communicate with their neighbors via a communication network with an arbitrary structure. Therefore, decentralized algorithms are valuable when centralized communication is expensive, undesirable, or impossible. Recently, significant advances have been made in the creation, design, and understanding of decen- tralized training methods. In particular, aspects such as data heterogeneity, communication efficiency, which includes local updates or compression, and personalization have been explored. However, these advancements have focused on training with single-criterion loss functions, which lead to minimization problems, and are not applicable to more general types of problems. For instance, training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) requires the simultaneous competing optimization of the generator and discriminator objectives, which translates to solving a non-convex-non-concave saddle-point problem (SPP). This kind of problem structure makes GANs extremely challenging to train, even in the single-node setting, let alone when training over decentralized datasets. This study centers around solving decentralized stochastic SPPs and, more broadly, decentralized stochastic Minty variational inequalities (MVIs). In a decentralized stochastic MVI, data is distributed . across M or more devices/nodes. Each device m has access to its own local stochastic oracle Fm(z, m) for the local operator Fm(z) := EmDmFm(z, m). The data m in device m follows a distribution Dm, which can vary across devices. The devices are connected via a communication network, allowing two devices to exchange information only if their corresponding nodes are connected by an edge in the network graph. The objective is to find cooperatively a point z* Rn that satisfies the inequality: M X m=1 E[Fm(z∗), z −z∗] ≥0 (1) for all z Rn. A specific instance of decentralized stochastic MVIs is the decentralized stochastic SPP with local objectives fm(x, y) := EmDm[fm(x, y, m)]: min x∈Rn max y∈Rm M X m=1 fm(x, y) (2) The connection to VI can be seen by setting z = (x, y) and the gradient field F(z) = (xf(x, y), -yf(x, y)). In cases where f(x,y) is convex-concave, the operator F(z) is monotone. However, in the context of GANs training, where x and y are parameters of the generator and discriminator, respectively, the local losses fm(x, y) are generally non-convex-non-concave in x, y, and monotonicity of F cannot be assumed. In this study, we develop a new algorithm for addressing problems (1) and (2). Because gradient descent-ascent for problem (2) can diverge even in simple convex-concave settings with a single device, we use extragradient updates and combine them with a gossip-type communication protocol on arbitrary, possibly dynamic, network topologies. One challenge arising from communication constraints is a “network error” that stems from the inability of all devices to achieve exact consensus. Therefore, each device uses a local variable, with only approximate consensus among devices achieved through gossip steps. Our method avoids multiple gossip steps per iteration, leading to better practical performance on dynamic networks. It also allows multiple local updates between communication rounds to reduce communication overhead, making it suitable for communication- and privacy-restricted FL or fully decentralized scenarios. Our Contributions: 1. We have created an algorithm that uses extragradient updates to tackle distributed stochas- tic MVIs, and consequently distributed stochastic SPPs, with heterogeneous data. This framework offers a flexible communication protocol that supports centralized settings like Federated Learning, fully decentralized configurations, local steps in both centralized and decentralized setups, and dynamic network topologies. 2. Using this general communication protocol, we have demonstrated the convergence of our algorithm in three MVI settings, namely where the operator is strongly-monotone, monotone, or non-monotone (assuming a Minty condition is met). The rates of convergence depend explicitly on several problem parameters, such as network characteristics, data heterogeneity, data variance, number of devices, and other relevant factors. These theoretical results translate directly to the corresponding SPP settings (strongly-convex-strongly-concave, convex-concave, and non-convex-non-concave under the Minty condition). All theoretical results are valid when using heterogeneous data, and allow quantifying how factors like data heterogeneity, noise in the data, and network characteristics influence convergence rate. We have also shown that for decentralized settings, our results are novel for time-varying graphs and the three different monotonicity settings. 3. We have verified our theoretical results through numerical experiments and demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy in practice. Specifically, we have trained a DCGAN architecture on the CIFAR-10 dataset. 2 2 Related Work Research on MVIs dates back to at least 1962, and has been continued in recent works. VIs are used in diverse applications: image denoising, game theory and optimal control, robust optimization, and non-smooth optimization using smooth reformulations. In ML, MVIs and SPPs arise in GANs training, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training. The extragradient method (EGM) was first introduced and later expanded to include deterministic problems and stochastic problems with bounded variance. However, if the stochastic noise is not uniformly bounded, EGM can diverge. 3 Algorithm This section details our proposed algorithm (Algorithm 1) based on two main concepts: (i) the extra- gradient step (as seen in classical methods for VIs), and (ii) gossip averaging (used in decentralized optimization and diffusion strategies in distributed learning). Instead of using gradient descent, as in similar algorithms, ours uses the extragradient method. It is designed for VIs and SPPs. It also includes local steps between communication rounds, supports dynamic networks, and comes with non-asymptotic theoretical convergence guarantees. Each step of Algorithm 1 has two phases. The local phase (lines 4–6) involves a step of the stochastic extragradient method at each node using only local data. Nodes make an extrapolation step “to look into the future” and then update using the operator value at the “future” point. Next is the communication phase (line 7), during which nodes share local iterates with their neighbors Nm in the communication network graph for each iteration k. Averaging is done using weights w k m,i, which are matrix Wk elements called the mixing matrix. Definition 2.1 (Mixing matrix). A matrix W [0; 1]M×M is a mixing matrix if it satisfies: 1) W is symmetric, 2) W is doubly stochastic (W1 = 1, 1TW = 1T, where 1 is the vector of all ones), 3) W is aligned with the network: wij 0 if and only if i = j or the edge (i, j) is in the communication network graph. Reasonable choices of mixing matrices include Wk = IM Lk /max(Lk), where Lk is the Laplacian matrix of the network graph at step k and IM is the identity matrix, or by using local rules based on the degrees of the neighboring nodes. Our setting offers great flexibility because the communication graph’s topology can change between iterations. The matrix Wk, which encodes the current network, also changes. This is encoded in line 2, where Wk is generated using a rule Wk that can vary. Examples include the deterministic choice of a matrix sequence Wk or sampling from a dynamic probability distribution on matrices. Local steps without communication can be encoded with a diagonal matrix Wk. Algorithm 1 Extra Step Time-Varying Gossip Method parameters: stepsize > 0, {Wk}k0 – rules or distributions for mixing matrix in iteration k. initialize: z0 Z, m : z0 m = z0 1: for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . do 2: Sample matrix Wk from Wk 3: for each node m do 4: Generate independently mk+1/3 Dm 5: zk+1/3 m = zk m Fm(zk m, mk+1/3 ) 6: Generate independently mk+2/3 Dm 7: zk+1 = Wk m,i zk+1/3 8: zk+1/3 end for 9: end for To ensure consensus between nodes, the mixing properties of the matrix sequence Wk must satisfy the following assumption: Assumption 2.2 (Expected Consensus Rate). There exists a constant p (0, 1] and an integer 1 such that, after K iterations, for all matrices Z Rd×M and all integers l 0, . . . , K/ , 3 EW  ||ZWlτ −¯Z||2 F  ≤(1 −p)||Z −¯Z||2 F (3) where Wl = W(l+1)1 ...Wl, we use the matrix notation Z = [z1, ..., zM] with z = (1/M)m=1M zm, and the expectation EW is over distributions of W and indices t l,...,(l+1) - 1. This assumption guarantees that the consensus between nodes improves by a factor of 1-p after every gossip steps. Some matrices Wk can be the identity matrix (local steps only). 4 Setting and Assumptions This section outlines the assumptions used to analyze the proposed algorithm: Assumption 3.1 (Lipschitzness). For every m, the operator Fm(z) is Lipschitz with a constant L, meaning that: ||Fm(z1) −Fm(z2)|| ≤L||z1 −z2||, ∀z1, z2 (4) This is a common assumption used when analyzing all the methods in Table 1. Assumption 3.2. We consider three scenarios for the operator F: (SM) Strong monotonicity, (M) Monotonicity, and (NM) Non-monotonicity under the Minty condition: (SM) Strong monotonicity. For some > 0 and for all z1, z2, we have: (F(z1) −F(z2), z1 −z2) ≥µ||z1 −z2||2 (5) (M) Monotonicity. For all z1, z2, we have: (F(z1) −F(z2), z1 −z2) ≥0 (6) (NM) Non-monotonicity (Minty). There exists z such that, for all z, (F(z), z −z∗) ≥0 (7) Assumptions (SM), (M), and (L) are widely used in the literature. Assumption (NM), often called Minty or Variational Stability, has recently been used as a non-monotonicity variant, particularly in GANs training. Assumption 3.3 (Bounded noise). Fm(z, ) is unbiased and has bounded variance. This means, for all z: E[Fm(z, ξ)] = Fm(z), E[||Fm(z, ξ) −Fm(z)||2] ≤σ2 (8) The final assumption pertains to the variability of local operators compared to their mean, which is called D-heterogeneity, and is commonly used when analyzing local-step algorithms. Assumption 3.4 (D-heterogeneity). The values of the local operator have bounded variability: ||Fm(z) −¯F(z)|| ≤D (9) 5 Main Results This section presents convergence rates for our proposed method under different settings de- fined by Assumption 3.2. We introduce the notation z = (1/M)m=1M zk for the average iter- ates and Z = (1/K)k=0K-1 z for the averaged sequence, i.e., ergodic average. We denote = (2/M + D2), whichistheconsensuserror. Theorem 4.1 (Main theorem). Let Assumptions 2.2 and 3.1-3.4 hold, and the sequence z generated by Algorithm 1 runs for K > 0 iterations. Then: • Strongly-monotone case: under Assumption 3.2 (SM) with = /L2, itholdsthat :E[||¯zK −z∗||2] ≤ 1 − µ 2L K ||z0 −z∗||2 + γL2∆ µ (10) 4 Monotone case: under Assumption 3.2 (M), for any convex compact C with z0,z C and Q = maxz,z’C ||z - z’|| < Qc, with = O(min1/(K0.5L), (1/L)(p/), itholdsthat : sup z∈C E[(F(¯zK), ¯zK −z)] ≤L2Q2 c K + (L p Qc∆+ ∆) s Q √ K (11) Under the assumption that for all k, ||zk||Qwith = O(min1/KL, p/), wehave : sup z∈C E[(F(¯z), ¯z −z)] ≤O(LQ2 K ) + O(L∆Q √ K ) (12) Non-monotone case: under Assumption 3.2 (NM) and if ||z∗||Qwith = O(min1/KL, p/),||z − z∗||2 ≤ LQ2 K + L2∆ µ + LQ K1/4 (13)Under the additional assumption that, for all k, ||zk||Q, wehavethatE[||¯zK −z∗||2] ≤LQ2 K + L2∆Q K1/4 (14) The proof of the theorem can be found in the supplementary materials, where the dependence of rates on the stepsize before optimal selection are given. In contrast to other analyses, our analysis addresses the fact that problem (1) has no feasible bounded set, which is important for analysis in both monotone and non-monotone settings. Furthermore, our algorithm includes a communication step that introduces a bias in the oracle, which needs to be analyzed over unbounded feasible sets. We overcome this by bounding the bias, and proving the boundedness in expectation of the sequence of iterates for both monotone and non-monotone cases. We also analyze stochastic extragradient method with biased oracles on unbounded domains which has not been done before. We achieve this under a general Assumption 2.2, with time varying graphs and all three monotonicity settings. The convergence rates explicitly depend on the network, characterized by mixing time and mixing factor p, and on data heterogeneity D, which appear only as the quantity , the variance 2, Lipschitz constant L, strong monotonicity parameter , and the number of nodes M. These results help us determine how data heterogeneity, noise, and network characteristics influence convergence. This opens meta-optimization opportunities to design networks and set parameters such as M, , and p to improve convergence. The convergence results presented in the theorem have a similar multi-term structure. The first term is from the deterministic case and mirrors existing methods for smooth VIs in a non-distributed setting. The second term is stochastic and is also standard for the non-distributed setting. The leading stochastic term is proportional to 2/M, decreasing with the number of nodes. Other terms represent a consensus error, due to imperfect communication between nodes. In all the cases this does not worsen the convergence, because dependence on K is no worse than the stochastic term. Theorem 4.1 is given for a fixed iteration budget K, and corresponding stepsizes that depend on K, which is standard in literature. We also offer a procedure that allows extending the result to all-time convergence without a priori fixed K, by restarting the algorithm after K iterations, which are doubled each time. In the strongly monotone case, our rate is slightly better than other results. The other methods’ stepsize is limited as p/(L2), slowing convergence. For decentralized settings, our rate is worse, probably because Assumption 2.2 is more general, but our algorithm is more practical because it avoids multiple gossip steps per iteration and works with time-varying topologies. In the monotone case, we use the Gap function as a measure of suboptimality. And in the non-monotone setting we are able to obtain convergence up to a certain accuracy. It is important to note that we use assumptions about iterates that we can obtain only when they are generated by the algorithm. We manage to obtain corresponding results that can be used for establishing that the algorithm behaves nicely under certain initial conditions. The experimental section will demonstrate these theoretical findings. 6 Experiments Here we present two experiments to validate the performance of Algorithm 1. Section 5.1 verifies the obtained convergence guarantees on two examples, a strongly-monotone and a monotone bilinear problem. Section 5.2 uses a non-monotone case with a GAN training application. Full details about the experimental setup are available in the supplementary material. 5 6.1 Verifying Theoretical Convergence Rate This experiment aims to determine whether Algorithm 1’s actual performance matches our theoretical rate from Theorem 4.1. We consider a distributed bilinear saddle point problem (SPP) with the objective functions: fm(x, y) = a∥x∥2 + b⟨y, Cmx⟩, where x, y, Cm ∈Rn, and a, b are real numbers. This setup satisfies the assumptions with constants: µ = a, L = a2 + b2, D = max m ∥Cm∥. The network uses M = 20 nodes with uniform averaging weights. The dimension is n = 5, b = 1, D ≈3, and τ = 1. The p value is approximately 0.288. To obtain stochastic gradients, unbiased Gaussian noise with variance σ2 is added. Convergence Behaviour. The convergence of Algorithm 1 with a fixed stepsize in both the strongly- monotone (a = 1) and monotone (a = 0) settings. In the strongly monotone setting we observe linear convergence up to an error floor determined by the noise and problem parameters. The monotone case converges more slowly, but is still linear up to a level. This is expected for bilinear problems. We see that when a constant stepsize is used in stochastic optimization algorithms, convergence is usually limited to a certain neighborhood, see Theorem 2 in a previous study. Theorem 4.1 also reflects this; convergence with zero error requires a diminishing stepsize. In the supplementary material, we also validate with decreasing stepsize. We verify the dependence on the heterogeneity parameter D and set the noise σ2 = 0. Based on the theory, we expect that the error when σ = 0 scales as O(D2K−2). We conduct experiments by setting b = 1 and a = 1, and measuring how many iterations are needed for 1 M X m zk −z∗ < ϵ, while varying D. The step size is tuned for every experiment. The number of iterations scale as K ≈ϵ−4, confirming that the error depends on K as O(K−1/2). The middle plot shows that iterations scale proportionally to D (D ≈K). Lastly, we see the number of iterations to reach ϵ = 0.01 while varying the graph parameter p, and observe D ≈p · K. This means that experiments confirm the O  1 pDK2 term in the convergence rate. 6.2 Training GANs Our method allows for combining communication graph topologies and local steps during distributed learning. This section explores our method on GANs training. In Section A.1, we discuss the relevance of our theoretical results to GANs training. Data and model. We use the CIFAR-10 dataset which includes 60,000 images across 10 classes. We increase the dataset four times by adding transformations and noise, and simulate a distributed set up using 16 nodes on two GPUs with Ray. We create heterogeneity by splitting the dataset into 16 subsets where a major class makes up 20% of the data and the rest is split uniformly between all the other classes. We use the DCGAN architecture, conditioned by class labels, similar to a previous paper. We use Adam as the optimizer. We make one local Adam step and one gossip averaging step with time-varying matrices Wk, similarly to Algorithm 1. Settings. We compare the following topologies, with respective matrices Wk: • Full. A full graph is used at the end of each epoch; otherwise, local steps are taken. This leads to 120 communication rounds per epoch. • Local. A full graph is used every five epochs; otherwise, local steps are taken. This means 24 communication rounds per epoch on average. 6 • Clusters. At the end of each epoch, clique clusters of size 4 are formed randomly (4 cliques in total). This results in 24 communication rounds per epoch. The first topology has a 5x larger communication budget. The learning rate is 0.002 for both generator and discriminator. The rest of the parameters are in the supplementary material. 7 Results The methods reach a similar convergence in terms of local epochs and produced similar images. The Local and Cluster topologies perform much better in terms of communication, with the Cluster topology slightly outperforming the Local. 8 Conclusion We have developed an effective algorithm to solve decentralized stochastic MVIs and SPPs, assuming a highly flexible network topology and communication constraints. This method represents the first decentralized extragradient approach that supports local steps for dynamic network topologies. We theoretically demonstrated the convergence rate of the algorithm for SM, M, and NM cases. In numerical experiments, we validated that the dependency on the data heterogeneity parameter D is tight in the SM case and impossible to improve in general. By training DCGAN in a decentralized manner, we showed our method’s effectiveness for practical DL tasks. Future work could extend these algorithms to infinite-dimensional problems. 7",1,,,,
